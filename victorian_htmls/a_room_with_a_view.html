<p/>PART ONE



<p/>Chapter I: The Bertolini

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Signora had no business to do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bertolini/Signora/Signora Bertolini</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett, <div class="bookquote">``no business
at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) promised us south rooms with a view close together, instead
of which here are north rooms, looking into a courtyard, and a long way
apart. Oh, Lucy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And a Cockney, besides!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, who had been further saddened by
the Signora's unexpected accent. <div class="bookquote">``It might be London.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) looked at the
two rows of English people who were sitting at the table; at the row
of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between the
English people; at the portraits of the late Queen and the late Poet
Laureate that hung behind the English people, heavily framed; at the
notice of the English church -LRB-Rev. Cuthbert Eager, M. A. Oxon.-RRB-, that
was the only other decoration of the wall. <div class="bookquote">``Charlotte, don't you feel,
too, that we might be in London? I can hardly believe that all kinds of
other things are just outside. I suppose it is one's being so tired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This meat has surely been used for soup,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett, laying
down her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) fork.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want so to see the Arno. The rooms the Signora promised us in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
letter would have looked over the Arno. The Signora had no business to
do it at all. Oh, it is a shame!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Any nook does for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>Miss Bartlett continued; <div class="bookquote">``but it does seem hard
that you shouldn't have a view.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had been selfish. <div class="bookquote">``Charlotte, you mustn't spoil me:
of course, you must look over the Arno, too. I meant that. The first
vacant room in the front--''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You must have it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett, part
of whose travelling expenses were paid by Lucy's mother--a piece of
generosity to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) made many a tactful allusion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no. You must have it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I insist on it. Your mother would never forgive me, Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would never forgive me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The ladies</b></font>)</div><p/>The ladies' voices grew animated, and--if the sad truth be owned--a
little peevish. They were tired, and under the guise of unselfishness
they wrangled. Some of their neighbours interchanged glances, and one
of them--one of the ill-bred people whom one does meet abroad--leant
forward over the table and actually intruded into their argument. He (<font color='blue'><b>neighbours</b></font>)
said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a view, I have a view.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett was startled. Generally at a pension people looked them
over for a day or two before speaking, and often did not find out that
they would <div class="bookquote">``do''  (<font color='red'><b>a pension people</b></font>)</div>till they had gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) knew that the intruder was
ill-bred, even before she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>intruder</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>intruder</b></font>) was an old man, of heavy
build, with a fair, shaven face and large eyes. There was something
childish in those eyes, though it was not the childishness of senility.
What exactly it was Miss Bartlett did not stop to consider, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>)
glance passed on to his (<font color='blue'><b>intruder</b></font>) clothes. These did not attract her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>intruder</b></font>) was
probably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the
swim. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) assumed a dazed expression when he (<font color='blue'><b>intruder</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>), and then
said: <div class="bookquote">``A view? Oh, a view! How delightful a view is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man; <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) name's George. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has a view
too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett, repressing Lucy, who was about to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``is that you can have our rooms, and we'll
have yours. We'll change.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The better class of tourist was shocked at this, and sympathized with
the new-comers. Miss Bartlett, in reply, opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) mouth as little
as possible, and said <div class="bookquote">``Thank you very much indeed; that is out of the
question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, with both fists on the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it is quite out of the question, thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, we don't like to take--''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>began Lucy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cousin again
repressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) persisted. <div class="bookquote">``Women like looking at a view; men don't.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) thumped with his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) fists like a naughty child, and turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) son,
saying, <div class="bookquote">``George, persuade them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's so obvious they should have the rooms,''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>said the son. <div class="bookquote">``There's
nothing else to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) did not look at the ladies as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) spoke, but his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) voice was perplexed
and sorrowful. Lucy, too, was perplexed; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw that they were in
for what is known as <div class="bookquote">``quite a scene,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had an odd feeling that
whenever these ill-bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened
till it dealt, not with rooms and views, but with--well, with something
quite different, whose existence she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had not realized before. Now the
old man attacked Miss Bartlett almost violently: Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) not
change? What possible objection had she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>)? They would clear out in half an
hour.

<p/>Miss Bartlett, though skilled in the delicacies of conversation, was
powerless in the presence of brutality. It was impossible to snub any
one so gross. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) face reddened with displeasure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) looked around as
much as to say, <div class="bookquote">``Are you all like this?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>And two little old ladies, who
were sitting further up the table, with shawls hanging over the backs
of the chairs, looked back, clearly indicating <div class="bookquote">``We are not; we are
genteel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>ladies</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eat your dinner, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) said to Lucy, and began to toy again with
the meat that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had once censured.

<p/>Lucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eat your dinner, dear. This pension is a failure. To-morrow we will
make a change.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Hardly had she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) announced this fell decision when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) reversed it. The
curtains at the end of the room parted, and revealed a clergyman, stout
but attractive, who hurried forward to take his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) place at the table,
cheerfully apologizing for his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) lateness. Lucy, who had not yet acquired
decency, at once rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) feet, exclaiming: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, oh! Why, it's
Mr. Beebe! Oh, how perfectly lovely! Oh, Charlotte, we must stop now,
however bad the rooms are. Oh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett said, with more restraint:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do, Mr. Beebe? I expect that you have forgotten us: Miss
Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch, who were at Tunbridge Wells when you
helped the Vicar of St. Peter's that very cold Easter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>The clergyman, who had the air of one on a holiday, did not remember
the ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) came forward
pleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was beckoned by
Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I AM so glad to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, who was in a state of
spiritual starvation, and would have been glad to see the waiter if
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cousin had permitted it. <div class="bookquote">``Just fancy how small the world is. Summer
Street, too, makes it so specially funny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Bartlett, filling up the gap, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) happened to tell me in the course
of conversation that you have just accepted the living--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes, I heard from mother so last week. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) didn't know that I knew you
at Tunbridge Wells; but I wrote back at once, and I said: `Mr. Beebe
is--'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite right,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>said the clergyman. <div class="bookquote">``I move into the Rectory at Summer
Street next June. I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming
neighbourhood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how glad I am! The name of our house is Windy Corner.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>Mr. Beebe
bowed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is mother and me generally, and my brother, though it's not often
we get him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to ch-- The church is rather far off, I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy, dearest, let Mr. Beebe eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am eating it, thank you, and enjoying it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) preferred to talk to Lucy, whose playing he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) remembered, rather than
to Miss Bartlett, who probably remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) sermons. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) asked the girl
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew Florence well, and was informed at some length that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
had never been there before. It is delightful to advise a newcomer, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) was first in the field. <div class="bookquote">``Don't neglect the country round,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) advice
concluded. <div class="bookquote">``The first fine afternoon drive up to Fiesole, and round by
Settignano, or something of that sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried a voice from the top of the table. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Beebe, you are
wrong. The first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That lady looks so clever,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>whispered Miss Bartlett to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) cousin. <div class="bookquote">``We
are in luck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And, indeed, a perfect torrent of information burst on them. People told
them what to see, when to see it, how to stop the electric trams, how to
get rid of the beggars, how much to give for a vellum blotter, how
much the place would grow upon them. The Pension Bertolini had decided,
almost enthusiastically, that they would do. Whichever way they looked,
kind ladies smiled and shouted at them. And above all rose the voice of
the clever lady, crying: <div class="bookquote">``Prato! They must go to Prato. That place is
too sweetly squalid for words. I love it; I revel in shaking off the
trammels of respectability, as you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man named George glanced at the clever lady, and then returned
moodily to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) plate. Obviously he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father did not do. Lucy, in
the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) success, found time to wish they did. It gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) no
extra pleasure that any one should be left in the cold; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
rose to go, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous little
bow.

<p/>The father did not see it; the son acknowledged it, not by another bow,
but by raising his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) eyebrows and smiling; he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) seemed to be smiling across
something.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hastened after her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cousin, who had already disappeared through the
curtains--curtains which smote one in the face, and seemed heavy with
more than cloth. Beyond them stood the unreliable Signora, bowing
good-evening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) guests, and supported by `Enery, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) little boy, and
Victorier, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) daughter. It made a curious little scene, this attempt
of the Cockney to convey the grace and geniality of the South. And even
more curious was the drawing-room, which attempted to rival the solid
comfort of a Bloomsbury boarding-house. Was this really Italy?

<p/>Miss Bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed arm-chair, which
had the colour and the contours of a tomato. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) was talking to Mr.
Beebe, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) spoke, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) long narrow head drove backwards and
forwards, slowly, regularly, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) were demolishing some
invisible obstacle. <div class="bookquote">``We are most grateful to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) was saying.
<div class="bookquote">``The first evening means so much. When you arrived we were in for a
peculiarly mauvais quart d’heure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) regret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you, by any chance, know the name of an old man who sat opposite us
at dinner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Emerson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) a friend of yours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are friendly--as one is in pensions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I will say no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) very slightly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) said more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am, as it were,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) concluded, <div class="bookquote">``the chaperon of my young cousin,
Lucy, and it would be a serious thing if I put her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) under an obligation
to people of whom we know nothing. His (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) manner was somewhat unfortunate.
I hope I acted for the best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You acted very naturally,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) seemed thoughtful, and after
a few moments added: <div class="bookquote">``All the same, I don't think much harm would have
come of accepting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No harm, of course. But we could not be under an obligation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is rather a peculiar man.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) hesitated, and then said gently:
<div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would not take advantage of your acceptance, nor expect you
to show gratitude. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) has the merit--if it is one--of saying exactly
what he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) means. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) has rooms he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) does not value, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) thinks you would
value them. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) no more thought of putting you under an obligation than
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) thought of being polite. It is so difficult--at least, I find it
difficult--to understand people who speak the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy was pleased, and said: <div class="bookquote">``I was hoping that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was nice; I do so
always hope that people will be nice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is; nice and tiresome. I differ from him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) on almost every
point of any importance, and so, I expect--I may say I hope--you will
differ. But his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores. When
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) first came here he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) not unnaturally put people's backs up. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) has no
tact and no manners--I don't mean by that that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) has bad manners--and
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) will not keep his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) opinions to himself. We nearly complained about
him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) to our depressing Signora, but I am glad to say we thought better of
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I to conclude,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is a Socialist?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe accepted the convenient word, not without a slight twitching
of the lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And presumably he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) has brought up his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) son to be a Socialist, too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hardly know George, for he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hasn't learnt to talk yet. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) seems a nice
creature, and I think he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has brains. Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has all his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father's
mannerisms, and it is quite possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), too, may be a Socialist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you relieve me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett. <div class="bookquote">``So you think I ought to
have accepted their offer? You feel I have been narrow-minded and
suspicious?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) answered; <div class="bookquote">``I never suggested that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But ought I not to apologize, at all events, for my apparent rudeness?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) replied, with some irritation, that it would be quite unnecessary,
and got up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) seat to go to the smoking-room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was I a bore?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) had disappeared. <div class="bookquote">``Why
didn't you talk, Lucy? He (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) prefers young people, I'm sure. I do hope I
haven't monopolized him (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>). I hoped you would have him (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) all the evening, as
well as all dinner-time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) is nice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``Just what I remember. He (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) seems to see
good in everyone. No one would take him (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) for a clergyman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Lucia--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you know what I mean. And you know how clergymen generally laugh;
Mr. Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Funny girl! How you do remind me of your mother. I wonder if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will
approve of Mr. Beebe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will; and so will Freddy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think everyone at Windy Corner will approve; it is the fashionable
world. I am used to Tunbridge Wells, where we are all hopelessly behind
the times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy despondently.

<p/>There was a haze of disapproval in the air, but whether the disapproval
was of herself, or of Mr. Beebe, or of the fashionable world at Windy
Corner, or of the narrow world at Tunbridge Wells, she (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) could not
determine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) tried to locate it, but as usual she (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) blundered. Miss
Bartlett sedulously denied disapproving of any one, and added <div class="bookquote">``I am
afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>And the girl again thought: <div class="bookquote">``I must have been selfish or unkind; I must
be more careful. It is so dreadful for Charlotte, being poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>Fortunately one of the little old ladies, who for some time had been
smiling very benignly, now approached and asked if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might be allowed
to sit where Mr. Beebe had sat. Permission granted, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) began to chatter
gently about Italy, the plunge it had been to come there, the gratifying
success of the plunge, the improvement in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sister's health, the
necessity of closing the bed-room windows at night, and of thoroughly
emptying the water-bottles in the morning. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) handled her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) subjects
agreeably, and they were, perhaps, more worthy of attention than
the high discourse upon Guelfs and Ghibellines which was proceeding
tempestuously at the other end of the room. It was a real catastrophe,
not a mere episode, that evening of hers at Venice, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had found
in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bedroom something that is one worse than a flea, though one
better than something else.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But here you are as safe as in England. Signora Bertolini is so
English.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet our rooms smell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said poor Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``We dread going to bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, then you look into the court.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sighed. <div class="bookquote">``If only Mr. Emerson was
more tactful! We were so sorry for you at dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) was meaning to be kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Undoubtedly he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature. Of
course, I was holding back on my cousin's account.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the little old lady; and they murmured that one could
not be too careful with a young girl.

<p/>Lucy tried to look demure, but could not help feeling a great fool. No
one was careful with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) at home; or, at all events, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had not noticed
it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About old Mr. Emerson--I hardly know. No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) is not tactful; yet, have
you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most
indelicate, and yet at the same time--beautiful?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Beautiful?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett, puzzled at the word. <div class="bookquote">``Are not beauty
and delicacy the same?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So one would have thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other helplessly. <div class="bookquote">``But things are
so difficult, I sometimes think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) proceeded no further into things, for Mr. Beebe reappeared, looking
extremely pleasant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Bartlett,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``it's all right about the rooms. I'm so glad.
Mr. Emerson was talking about it in the smoking-room, and knowing what
I did, I encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) to make the offer again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) has let me come and
ask you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) would be so pleased.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Charlotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>cried Lucy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cousin, <div class="bookquote">``we must have the rooms now.
The old man is just as nice and kind as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Beebe, after a pause, <div class="bookquote">``that I have been officious. I
must apologize for my interference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Gravely displeased, he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) turned to go. Not till then did Miss Bartlett
reply: <div class="bookquote">``My own wishes, dearest Lucy, are unimportant in comparison with
yours. It would be hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at
Florence, when I am only here through your kindness. If you wish me to
turn these gentlemen out of their rooms, I will do it. Would you then,
Mr. Beebe, kindly tell Mr. Emerson that I accept his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) kind offer, and
then conduct him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) to me, in order that I may thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) personally?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) voice as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) spoke; it was heard all over the
drawing-room, and silenced the Guelfs and the Ghibellines. The
clergyman, inwardly cursing the female sex, bowed, and departed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>)
message.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember, Lucy, I alone am implicated in this. I do not wish the
acceptance to come from you. Grant me that, at all events.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe was back, saying rather nervously:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Emerson is engaged, but here is his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) son instead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man gazed down on the three ladies, who felt seated on the
floor, so low were their chairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My father,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``is in his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) bath, so you cannot thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>)
personally. But any message given by you to me will be given by me to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) comes out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett was unequal to the bath. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) barbed civilities came
forth wrong end first. Young Mr. Emerson scored a notable triumph to the
delight of Mr. Beebe and to the secret delight of Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor young man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) had gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How angry he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) is with his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) father about the rooms! It is all he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) can do to
keep polite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Beebe. Then
looking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins, he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) retired to his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) own
rooms, to write up his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) philosophic diary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>breathed the little old lady, and shuddered as if all the
winds of heaven had entered the apartment. <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen sometimes do not
realize--''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) voice faded away, but Miss Bartlett seemed to understand
and a conversation developed, in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly
realize played a principal part. Lucy, not realizing either, was reduced
to literature. Taking up Baedeker's Handbook to Northern Italy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
committed to memory the most important dates of Florentine History. For
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was determined to enjoy herself on the morrow. Thus the half-hour
crept profitably away, and at last Miss Bartlett rose with a sigh, and
said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think one might venture now. No, Lucy, do not stir. I will
superintend the move.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How you do do everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Naturally, dear. It is my affair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I would like to help you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte's energy! And her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) unselfishness! She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had been thus all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
life, but really, on this Italian tour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was surpassing herself. So
Lucy felt, or strove to feel. And yet--there was a rebellious spirit
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less
delicate and more beautiful. At all events, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own room
without any feeling of joy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to explain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett, <div class="bookquote">``why it is that I have taken
the largest room. Naturally, of course, I should have given it to you;
but I happen to know that it belongs to the young man, and I was sure
your mother would not like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy was bewildered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under
an obligation to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father than to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I am a woman of the world, in
my small way, and I know where things lead to. However, Mr. Beebe is a
guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother wouldn't mind I'm sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, but again had the sense of
larger and unsuspected issues.

<p/>Miss Bartlett only sighed, and enveloped her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) in a protecting embrace as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) good-night. It gave Lucy the sensation of a fog, and when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own room she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) opened the window and breathed the clean
night air, thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to see the
lights dancing in the Arno and the cypresses of San Miniato, and the
foot-hills of the Apennines, black against the rising moon.

<p/>Miss Bartlett, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) room, fastened the window-shutters and locked the
door, and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards
led, and whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances. It was
then that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) saw, pinned up over the washstand, a sheet of paper on
which was scrawled an enormous note of interrogation. Nothing more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) thought, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) examined it carefully by the
light of a candle. Meaningless at first, it gradually became menacing,
obnoxious, portentous with evil. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) was seized with an impulse to
destroy it, but fortunately remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) had no right to do so,
since it must be the property of young Mr. Emerson. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) unpinned it
carefully, and put it between two pieces of blotting-paper to keep it
clean for him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) completed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) inspection of the room, sighed
heavily according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) habit, and went to bed.



<p/>Chapter II: In Santa Croce with No Baedeker

<p/>It was pleasant to wake up in Florence, to open the eyes upon a bright
bare room, with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are
not; with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini sport
in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons. It was pleasant, too, to
fling wide the windows, pinching the fingers in unfamiliar fastenings,
to lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees and marble
churches opposite, and close below, the Arno, gurgling against the
embankment of the road.

<p/>Over the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy
foreshore, and on the river was a boat, also diligently employed for
some mysterious end. An electric tram came rushing underneath the
window. No one was inside it, except one tourist; but its platforms were
overflowing with Italians, who preferred to stand. Children tried to
hang on behind, and the conductor, with no malice, spat in their faces
to make them let go. Then soldiers appeared--good-looking, undersized
men--wearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur, and a great-coat
which had been cut for some larger soldier. Beside them walked officers,
looking foolish and fierce, and before them went little boys, turning
somersaults in time with the band. The tramcar became entangled in their
ranks, and moved on painfully, like a caterpillar in a swarm of ants.
One of the little boys fell down, and some white bullocks came out of
an archway. Indeed, if it had not been for the good advice of an old man
who was selling button-hooks, the road might never have got clear.

<p/>Over such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away,
and the traveller who has gone to Italy to study the tactile values of
Giotto, or the corruption of the Papacy, may return remembering nothing
but the blue sky and the men and women who live under it. So it was as
well that Miss Bartlett should tap and come in, and having commented on
Lucy's leaving the door unlocked, and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) leaning out of the window
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was fully dressed, should urge her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to hasten herself, or the
best of the day would be gone. By the time Lucy was ready her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cousin
had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) breakfast, and was listening to the clever lady among the
crumbs.

<p/>A conversation then ensued, on not unfamiliar lines. Miss Bartlett
was, after all, a wee bit tired, and thought they had better spend the
morning settling in; unless Lucy would at all like to go out? Lucy would
rather like to go out, as it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) first day in Florence, but, of
course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could go alone. Miss Bartlett could not allow this. Of
course she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) would accompany Lucy everywhere. Oh, certainly not; Lucy
would stop with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cousin. Oh, no! that would never do. Oh, yes!

<p/>At this point the clever lady broke in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it is Mrs. Grundy who is troubling you, I do assure you that you
can neglect the good person. Being English, Miss Honeychurch will be
perfectly safe. Italians understand. A dear friend of mine, Contessa
Baroncelli, has two daughters, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) cannot send a maid to school
with them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) lets them go in sailor-hats instead. Every one takes
them for English, you see, especially if their hair is strained tightly
behind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett was unconvinced by the safety of Contessa Baroncelli's
daughters. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) was determined to take Lucy herself, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) head not being
so very bad. The clever lady then said that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was going to spend a
long morning in Santa Croce, and if Lucy would come too, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would be
delighted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will take you by a dear dirty back way, Miss Honeychurch, and if you
bring me luck, we shall have an adventure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy said that this was most kind, and at once opened the Baedeker, to
see where Santa Croce was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tut, tut! Miss Lucy! I hope we shall soon emancipate you from Baedeker.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Baroncelli</b></font>) does but touch the surface of things. As to the true Italy--he (<font color='blue'><b>Baroncelli</b></font>) does
not even dream of it. The true Italy is only to be found by patient
observation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>This sounded very interesting, and Lucy hurried over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) breakfast, and
started with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) new friend in high spirits. Italy was coming at last.
The Cockney Signora and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) works had vanished like a bad dream.

<p/>Miss Lavish--for that was the clever lady's name--turned to the right
along the sunny Lung' Arno. How delightfully warm! But a wind down
the side streets cut like a knife, didn't it? Ponte alle
Grazie--particularly interesting, mentioned by Dante. San
Miniato--beautiful as well as interesting; the crucifix that kissed
a murderer--Miss Honeychurch would remember the story. The men on the
river were fishing. -LRB-Untrue; but then, so is most information.-RRB- Then
Miss Lavish darted under the archway of the white bullocks, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>)
stopped, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) cried:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A smell! a true Florentine smell! Every city, let me teach you, has its
own smell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it a very nice smell?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, who had inherited from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother
a distaste to dirt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One doesn't come to Italy for niceness,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the retort; <div class="bookquote">``one comes for
life. Buon giorno! Buon giorno!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>bowing right and left. <div class="bookquote">``Look at that
adorable wine-cart! How the driver stares at us, dear, simple soul!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a kitten</b></font>)</div><p/>So Miss Lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of Florence,
short, fidgety, and playful as a kitten, though without a kitten's
grace. It was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so
cheerful; and a blue military cloak, such as an Italian officer wears,
only increased the sense of festivity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Buon giorno! Take the word of an old woman, Miss Lucy: you will
never repent of a little civility to your inferiors. That is the
true democracy. Though I am a real Radical as well. There, now you're
shocked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, I'm not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``We are Radicals, too, out and out.
My father always voted for Mr. Gladstone, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was so dreadful about
Ireland.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see, I see. And now you have gone over to the enemy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, please--! If my father was alive, I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would vote Radical
again now that Ireland is all right. And as it is, the glass over our
front door was broken last election, and Freddy is sure it was the
Tories; but mother says nonsense, a tramp.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shameful! A manufacturing district, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--in the Surrey hills. About five miles from Dorking, looking over
the Weald.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Lavish seemed interested, and slackened her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) trot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a delightful part; I know it so well. It is full of the very
nicest people. Do you know Sir Harry Otway--a Radical if ever there
was?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And old Mrs. Butterworth the philanthropist?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Butterworth</b></font>) rents a field of us! How funny!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky, and murmured: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, you
have property in Surrey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hardly any,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, fearful of being thought a snob. <div class="bookquote">``Only thirty
acres--just the garden, all downhill, and some fields.''

 (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Lavish was not disgusted, and said it was just the size of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
aunt's Suffolk estate. Italy receded. They tried to remember the last
name of Lady Louisa someone, who had taken a house near Summer Street
the other year, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) had not liked it, which was odd of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>). And just
as Miss Lavish had got the name, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) broke off and exclaimed:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless us! Bless us and save us! We've lost the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Certainly they had seemed a long time in reaching Santa Croce, the tower
of which had been plainly visible from the landing window. But Miss
Lavish had said so much about knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) Florence by heart, that Lucy
had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) with no misgivings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lost! lost! My dear Miss Lucy, during our political diatribes we have
taken a wrong turning. How those horrid Conservatives would jeer at us!
What are we to do? Two lone females in an unknown town. Now, this is
what I call an adventure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy, who wanted to see Santa Croce, suggested, as a possible solution,
that they should ask the way there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but that is the word of a craven! And no, you are not, not, NOT to
look at your Baedeker. Give it to me; I shan't let you carry it. We will
simply drift.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Accordingly they drifted through a series of those grey-brown streets,
neither commodious nor picturesque, in which the eastern quarter of the
city abounds. Lucy soon lost interest in the discontent of Lady
Louisa, and became discontented herself. For one ravishing moment Italy
appeared. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) stood in the Square of the Annunziata and saw in the
living terra-cotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can
ever stale. There they stood, with their shining limbs bursting from
the garments of charity, and their strong white arms extended against
circlets of heaven. Lucy thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had never seen anything more
beautiful; but Miss Lavish, with a shriek of dismay, dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
forward, declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a
mile.

<p/>The hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins, or
rather ceases, to tell, and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste
out of a little shop, because it looked so typical. It tasted partly
of the paper in which it was wrapped, partly of hair oil, partly of the
great unknown. But it gave them strength to drift into another Piazza,
large and dusty, on the farther side of which rose a black-and-white
facade of surpassing ugliness. Miss Lavish spoke to it dramatically. It
was Santa Croce. The adventure was over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop a minute; let those two people go on, or I shall have to speak to
them. I do detest conventional intercourse. Nasty! they are going into
the church, too. Oh, the Britisher abroad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We sat opposite them at dinner last night. They have given us their
rooms. They were so very kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at their figures!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>laughed Miss Lavish. <div class="bookquote">``They walk through my
Italy like a pair of cows. It's very naughty of me, but I would like
to set an examination paper at Dover, and turn back every tourist who
couldn't pass it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What would you ask us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Lavish laid her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hand pleasantly on Lucy's arm, as if to suggest
that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), at all events, would get full marks. In this exalted mood they
reached the steps of the great church, and were about to enter it when
Miss Lavish stopped, squeaked, flung up her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) arms, and cried:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There goes my local-colour box! I must have a word with him (<font color='blue'><b>tourist</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And in a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was away over the Piazza, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) military cloak
flapping in the wind; nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) slacken speed till she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) caught up an
old man with white whiskers, and nipped him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) playfully upon the arm.

<p/>Lucy waited for nearly ten minutes. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) began to get tired. The
beggars worried her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), the dust blew in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) eyes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) remembered that
a young girl ought not to loiter in public places. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) descended slowly
into the Piazza with the intention of rejoining Miss Lavish, who was
really almost too original. But at that moment Miss Lavish and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
local-colour box moved also, and disappeared down a side street, both
gesticulating largely. Tears of indignation came to Lucy's eyes partly
because Miss Lavish had jilted her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), partly because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
Baedeker. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) find her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) way home? How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) find her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) way
about in Santa Croce? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) first morning was ruined, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) might never
be in Florence again. A few minutes ago she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had been all high spirits,
talking as a woman of culture, and half persuading herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
was full of originality. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) entered the church depressed and
humiliated, not even able to remember whether it was built by the
Franciscans or the Dominicans. Of course, it must be a wonderful
building. But how like a barn! And how very cold! Of course, it
contained frescoes by Giotto, in the presence of whose tactile values
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was capable of feeling what was proper. But who was to tell
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) which they were? She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) walked about disdainfully, unwilling to be
enthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date. There was
no one even to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) which, of all the sepulchral slabs that paved
the nave and transepts, was the one that was really beautiful, the one
that had been most praised by Mr. Ruskin.

<p/>Then the pernicious charm of Italy worked on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), and, instead of
acquiring information, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) began to be happy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) puzzled out the
Italian notices--the notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into
the church--the notice that prayed people, in the interest of health and
out of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves,
not to spit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) watched the tourists; their noses were as red as their
Baedekers, so cold was Santa Croce. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) beheld the horrible fate that
overtook three Papists--two he-babies and a she-baby--who began their
career by sousing each other with the Holy Water, and then proceeded to
the Machiavelli memorial, dripping but hallowed. Advancing towards it
very slowly and from immense distances, they touched the stone with
their fingers, with their handkerchiefs, with their heads, and then
retreated. What could this mean? They did it again and again. Then Lucy
realized that they had mistaken Machiavelli for some saint, hoping
to acquire virtue. Punishment followed quickly. The smallest he-baby
stumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by Mr. Ruskin,
and entangled his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruskin</b></font>) feet in the features of a recumbent bishop. Protestant
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was, Lucy darted forward. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was too late. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ruskin</b></font>) fell heavily upon
the prelate's upturned toes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hateful bishop!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the voice of old Mr. Emerson, who had darted
forward also. <div class="bookquote">``Hard in life, hard in death. Go out into the sunshine,
little boy, and kiss your hand to the sun, for that is where you ought
to be. Intolerable bishop!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div><p/>The child screamed frantically at these words, and at these dreadful
people who picked him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) up, dusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>), rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) bruises, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>)
not to be superstitious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Emerson to Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``Here's a mess: a baby hurt,
cold, and frightened! But what else can you expect from a church?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div><p/>The child's legs had become as melting wax. Each time that old Mr.
Emerson and Lucy set it erect it collapsed with a roar. Fortunately an
Italian lady, who ought to have been saying her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) prayers, came to the
rescue. By some mysterious virtue, which mothers alone possess, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
stiffened the little boy's back-bone and imparted strength to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knees.
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stood. Still gibbering with agitation, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) walked away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a clever woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Emerson. <div class="bookquote">``You have done more than
all the relics in the world. I am not of your creed, but I do believe in
those who make their fellow-creatures happy. There is no scheme of the
universe--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) paused for a phrase.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Niente,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the Italian lady, and returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) prayers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not sure she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) understands English,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>suggested Lucy.

<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) chastened mood she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) no longer despised the Emersons. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was
determined to be gracious to them, beautiful rather than delicate,
and, if possible, to erase Miss Bartlett's civility by some gracious
reference to the pleasant rooms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That woman understands everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>was Mr. Emerson's reply. <div class="bookquote">``But what
are you doing here? Are you doing the church? Are you through with the
church?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>cried Lucy, remembering her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) grievance. <div class="bookquote">``I came here with Miss
Lavish, who was to explain everything; and just by the door--it is too
bad!--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) simply ran away, and after waiting quite a time, I had to come
in by myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Emerson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, why shouldn't you come by yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>said the son, addressing the
young lady for the first time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But Miss Lavish has even taken away Baedeker.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Baedeker?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Emerson. <div class="bookquote">``I'm glad it's THAT you minded. It's worth
minding, the loss of a Baedeker. THAT'S worth minding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy was puzzled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was again conscious of some new idea, and was not
sure whither it would lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you've no Baedeker,''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>said the son, <div class="bookquote">``you'd better join us.''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>Was this
where the idea would lead? She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) took refuge in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) dignity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you very much, but I could not think of that. I hope you do not
suppose that I came to join on to you. I really came to help with the
child, and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night. I
hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man gently, <div class="bookquote">``I think that you are repeating what
you have heard older people say. You are pretending to be touchy; but
you are not really. Stop being so tiresome, and tell me instead what
part of the church you want to see. To take you to it will be a real
pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, this was abominably impertinent, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) ought to have been
furious. But it is sometimes as difficult to lose one's temper as it
is difficult at other times to keep it. Lucy could not get cross. Mr.
Emerson was an old man, and surely a girl might humour him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>). On the other
hand, his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) son was a young man, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt that a girl ought to be
offended with him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>), or at all events be offended before him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>). It was at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gazed before replying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not touchy, I hope. It is the Giottos that I want to see, if you
will kindly tell me which they are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The son</b></font>)</div><p/>The son nodded. With a look of sombre satisfaction, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) led the way to
the Peruzzi Chapel. There was a hint of the teacher about him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt
like a child in school who had answered a question rightly.

<p/>The chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation, and out of
them rose the voice of a lecturer, directing them how to worship Giotto,
not by tactful valuations, but by the standards of the spirit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lecturer</b></font>) was saying, <div class="bookquote">``the facts about this church of Santa Croce;
how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism, before
any taint of the Renaissance had appeared. Observe how Giotto in these
frescoes--now, unhappily, ruined by restoration--is untroubled by the
snares of anatomy and perspective. Could anything be more majestic, more
pathetic, beautiful, true? How little, we feel, avails knowledge and
technical cleverness against a man who truly feels!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Emerson, in much too loud a voice for church.
<div class="bookquote">``Remember nothing of the sort! Built by faith indeed! That simply means
the workmen weren't paid properly. And as for the frescoes, I see no
truth in them. Look at that fat man in blue! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must weigh as much as I
do, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is shooting into the sky like an air balloon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) was referring to the fresco of the <div class="bookquote">``Ascension of St. John.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Inside,
the lecturer's voice faltered, as well it might. The audience shifted
uneasily, and so did Lucy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) ought not to be with
these men; but they had cast a spell over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). They were so serious and
so strange that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not remember how to behave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, did this happen, or didn't it? Yes or no?''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div><p/>George replied:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It happened like this, if it happened at all. I would rather go up to
heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs; and if I got there I should
like my friends to lean out of it, just as they do here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will never go up,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``You and I, dear boy, will
lie at peace in the earth that bore us, and our names will disappear as
surely as our work survives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some of the people can only see the empty grave, not the saint, whoever
he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) is, going up. It did happen like that, if it happened at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a frigid voice. <div class="bookquote">``The chapel is somewhat small for two
parties. We will incommode you no longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lecturer</b></font>)</div><p/>The lecturer was a clergyman, and his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) audience must be also his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) flock,
for they held prayer-books as well as guide-books in their hands. They
filed out of the chapel in silence. Amongst them were the two little old
ladies of the Pension Bertolini--Miss Teresa and Miss Catherine Alan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Emerson. <div class="bookquote">``There's plenty of room for us all. Stop!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The procession disappeared without a word.

<p/>Soon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel, describing the life
of St. Francis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George, I do believe that clergyman is the Brixton curate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div><p/>George went into the next chapel and returned, saying <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is. I
don't remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I had better speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and remind him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) who I am. It's that Mr.
Eager. Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) go? Did we talk too loud? How vexatious. I shall go
and say we are sorry. Hadn't I better? Then perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) will come back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) will not come back,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/>But Mr. Emerson, contrite and unhappy, hurried away to apologize to the
Rev. Cuthbert Eager. Lucy, apparently absorbed in a lunette, could hear
the lecture again interrupted, the anxious, aggressive voice of the old
man, the curt, injured replies of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opponent. The son, who took every
little contretemps as if it were a tragedy, was listening also.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My father has that effect on nearly everyone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) informed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
will try to be kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope we all try,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), smiling nervously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because we think it improves our characters. But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is kind to people
because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) loves them; and they find him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) out, and are offended, or
frightened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How silly of them!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, though in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sympathized; <div class="bookquote">``I
think that a kind action done tactfully--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tact!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) threw up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head in disdain. Apparently she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had given the wrong
answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel.
For a young man his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face was rugged, and--until the shadows fell upon
it--hard. Enshadowed, it sprang into tenderness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) once again
at Rome, on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, carrying a burden of
acorns. Healthy and muscular, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) yet gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) the feeling of greyness,
of tragedy that might only find solution in the night. The feeling soon
passed; it was unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to have entertained anything so subtle. Born
of silence and of unknown emotion, it passed when Mr. Emerson returned,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could re-enter the world of rapid talk, which was alone familiar
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you snubbed?''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) son tranquilly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But we have spoilt the pleasure of I don't know how many people. They
won't come back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``...full of innate sympathy...quickness to perceive good in
others...vision of the brotherhood of man...''  (<font color='red'><b>St. Francis</b></font>)</div>Scraps of the lecture on
St. Francis came floating round the partition wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let us spoil yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Francis</b></font>) continued to Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``Have you looked at
those saints?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``They are lovely. Do you know which is the tombstone
that is praised in Ruskin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Francis</b></font>) did not know, and suggested that they should try to guess it. George,
rather to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) relief, refused to move, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) and the old man wandered
not unpleasantly about Santa Croce, which, though it is like a barn,
has harvested many beautiful things inside its walls. There were also
beggars to avoid and guides to dodge round the pillars, and an old lady
with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dog, and here and there a priest modestly edging to his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)
Mass through the groups of tourists. But Mr. Emerson was only half
interested. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) watched the lecturer, whose success he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) had
impaired, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) anxiously watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why will he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruskin</b></font>) look at that fresco?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) said uneasily. <div class="bookquote">``I saw nothing in
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like Giotto,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``It is so wonderful what they say about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruskin</b></font>) tactile values. Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies
better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you ought. A baby is worth a dozen saints. And my baby's worth the
whole of Paradise, and as far as I can see he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruskin</b></font>) lives in Hell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy again felt that this did not do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In Hell,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ruskin</b></font>)'s unhappy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruskin</b></font>) be unhappy when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruskin</b></font>) is strong and alive? What more is one
to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Ruskin</b></font>)? And think how he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruskin</b></font>) has been brought up--free from all the
superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name
of God. With such an education as that, I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was bound to grow
up happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was no theologian, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) felt that here was a very foolish old
man, as well as a very irreligious one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) also felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother
might not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) talking to that kind of person, and that Charlotte
would object most strongly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are we to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) comes out for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) holiday to
Italy, and behaves--like that; like the little child who ought to have
been playing, and who hurt himself upon the tombstone. Eh? What did you
say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy had made no suggestion. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now don't be stupid over this. I don't require you to fall in love with
my boy, but I do think you might try and understand him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). You are nearer
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) age, and if you let yourself go I am sure you are sensible. You
might help me. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has known so few women, and you have the time.
You stop here several weeks, I suppose? But let yourself go. You are
inclined to get muddled, if I may judge from last night. Let yourself
go. Pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand,
and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them. By
understanding George you may learn to understand yourself. It will be
good for both of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>To this extraordinary speech Lucy found no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I only know what it is that's wrong with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>); not why it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>asked Lucy fearfully, expecting some harrowing tale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The old trouble; things won't fit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Emerson, whatever do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ordinary voice, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) scarcely realized he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was quoting
poetry, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said:

<p/>```From far, from eve and morning,
And yon twelve-winded sky,
The stuff of life to knit me
Blew hither: here am I'

<p/>George and I both know this, but why does it distress him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)? We know that
we come from the winds, and that we shall return to them; that all life
is perhaps a knot, a tangle, a blemish in the eternal smoothness. But
why should this make us unhappy? Let us rather love one another, and
work and rejoice. I don't believe in this world sorrow.''

<p/>Miss Honeychurch assented.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then make my boy think like us. Make him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) realize that by the side of
the everlasting Why there is a Yes--a transitory Yes if you like, but a
Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) laughed; surely one ought to laugh. A young man melancholy
because the universe wouldn't fit, because life was a tangle or a wind,
or a Yes, or something!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``You'll think me unfeeling, but--but--''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) became matronly. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, but your son wants employment. Has he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) no
particular hobby? Why, I myself have worries, but I can generally forget
them at the piano; and collecting stamps did no end of good for my
brother. Perhaps Italy bores him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>); you ought to try the Alps or the
Lakes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man's face saddened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) gently with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.
This did not alarm her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) advice had impressed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was thanking her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) for it. Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no longer alarmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>)
at all; she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as a kind thing, but quite silly. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) feelings
were as inflated spiritually as they had been an hour ago esthetically,
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) lost Baedeker. The dear George, now striding towards them
over the tombstones, seemed both pitiable and absurd. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) approached, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
face in the shadow. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Bartlett.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, good gracious me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, suddenly collapsing and again seeing
the whole of life in a new perspective. <div class="bookquote">``Where? Where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see. Those gossiping little Miss Alans must have--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) checked
herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>exploded Mr. Emerson. <div class="bookquote">``Poor girl!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not let this pass, for it was just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was feeling
herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor girl? I fail to understand the point of that remark. I think
myself a very fortunate girl, I assure you. I'm thoroughly happy, and

Good-bye. Thank you both so much for all your kindness. Ah, yes! there

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cousin.



<p/>Chapter III: Music, Violets, and the Letter <div class="bookquote">``S''

 (<font color='red'><b>Violets</b></font>)</div><p/>It so happened that Lucy, who found daily life rather chaotic, entered
a more solid world when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) opened the piano. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was then no longer
either deferential or patronizing; no longer either a rebel or a slave.
The kingdom of music is not the kingdom of this world; it will accept
those whom breeding and intellect and culture have alike rejected. The
commonplace person begins to play, and shoots into the empyrean without
effort, whilst we look up, marvelling how he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) has escaped us, and
thinking how we could worship him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) and love him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>), would he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) but translate
his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) visions into human words, and his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) experiences into human actions.
Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) cannot; certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) does not, or does so very seldom. Lucy
had done so never.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was no dazzling executante; her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) runs were not at all like strings of
pearls, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) struck no more right notes than was suitable for one
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) age and situation. Nor was she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) the passionate young lady, who
performs so tragically on a summer's evening with the window open.
Passion was there, but it could not be easily labelled; it slipped
between love and hatred and jealousy, and all the furniture of the
pictorial style. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was tragical only in the sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was
great, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) loved to play on the side of Victory. Victory of what and
over what--that is more than the words of daily life can tell us. But
that some sonatas of Beethoven are written tragic no one can gainsay;
yet they can triumph or despair as the player decides, and Lucy had
decided that they should triumph.

<p/>A very wet afternoon at the Bertolini permitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to do the thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
really liked, and after lunch she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) opened the little draped piano. A few
people lingered round and praised her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) playing, but finding that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
made no reply, dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or
to sleep. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) took no notice of Mr. Emerson looking for his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) son, nor of
Miss Bartlett looking for Miss Lavish, nor of Miss Lavish looking for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) cigarette-case. Like every true performer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) was intoxicated by
the mere feel of the notes: they were fingers caressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) own; and by
touch, not by sound alone, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) desire.

<p/>Mr. Beebe, sitting unnoticed in the window, pondered this illogical
element in Miss Honeychurch, and recalled the occasion at Tunbridge
Wells when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) had discovered it. It was at one of those entertainments
where the upper classes entertain the lower. The seats were filled with
a respectful audience, and the ladies and gentlemen of the parish, under
the auspices of their vicar, sang, or recited, or imitated the drawing
of a champagne cork. Among the promised items was <div class="bookquote">``Miss Honeychurch.
Piano. Beethoven,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>and Mr. Beebe was wondering whether it would be
Adelaida, or the march of The Ruins of Athens, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) composure
was disturbed by the opening bars of Opus III. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) was in suspense all
through the introduction, for not until the pace quickens does one know
what the performer intends. With the roar of the opening theme he (<font color='blue'><b>performer</b></font>) knew
that things were going extraordinarily; in the chords that herald the
conclusion he (<font color='blue'><b>performer</b></font>) heard the hammer strokes of victory. He (<font color='blue'><b>performer</b></font>) was glad that she (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>)
only played the first movement, for he (<font color='blue'><b>performer</b></font>) could have paid no attention to
the winding intricacies of the measures of nine-sixteen. The audience
clapped, no less respectful. It was Mr. Beebe who started the stamping;
it was all that one could do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) asked the vicar afterwards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cousin of one of my parishioners. I do not consider her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) choice of a
piece happy. Beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his (<font color='blue'><b>Beethoven</b></font>) appeal
that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that, which, if
anything, disturbs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Introduce me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) will be delighted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) and Miss Bartlett are full of the praises of
your sermon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My sermon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Beebe. <div class="bookquote">``Why ever did she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) listen to it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) was introduced he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) understood why, for Miss Honeychurch,
disjoined from her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) music stool, was only a young lady with a quantity of
dark hair and a very pretty, pale, undeveloped face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) loved going to
concerts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) loved stopping with her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) cousin, she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) loved iced coffee and
meringues. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) did not doubt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) sermon also. But before
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) left Tunbridge Wells he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) made a remark to the vicar, which he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) now
made to Lucy herself when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) closed the little piano and moved dreamily
towards him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) plays, it will be very
exciting both for us and for her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy at once re-entered daily life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what a funny thing! Some one said just the same to mother, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) trusted I should never live a duet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't Mrs. Honeychurch like music?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) doesn't mind it. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) doesn't like one to get excited over
anything; she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) thinks I am silly about it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) thinks--I can't make
out. Once, you know, I said that I liked my own playing better than any
one's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) has never got over it. Of course, I didn't mean that I played
well; I only meant--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), wondering why she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) bothered to explain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Music--''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, as if attempting some generality. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not
complete it, and looked out absently upon Italy in the wet. The whole
life of the South was disorganized, and the most graceful nation in
Europe had turned into formless lumps of clothes.

<p/>The street and the river were dirty yellow, the bridge was dirty grey,
and the hills were dirty purple. Somewhere in their folds were concealed
Miss Lavish and Miss Bartlett, who had chosen this afternoon to visit
the Torre del Gallo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What about music?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Beebe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Charlotte will be sopped,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>was Lucy's reply.

<p/>The expedition was typical of Miss Bartlett, who would return cold,
tired, hungry, and angelic, with a ruined skirt, a pulpy Baedeker, and
a tickling cough in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) throat. On another day, when the whole world was
singing and the air ran into the mouth, like wine, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) would refuse to
stir from the drawing-room, saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) was an old thing, and no fit
companion for a hearty girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Lavish has led your cousin astray. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hopes to find the true
Italy in the wet I believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Lavish is so original,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>murmured Lucy. This was a stock remark,
the supreme achievement of the Pension Bertolini in the way of
definition. Miss Lavish was so original. Mr. Beebe had his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) doubts, but
they would have been put down to clerical narrowness. For that, and for
other reasons, he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) peace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>continued Lucy in awe-struck tone, <div class="bookquote">``that Miss Lavish is
writing a book?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They do say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be a novel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Beebe, <div class="bookquote">``dealing with modern Italy.
Let me refer you for an account to Miss Catharine Alan, who uses words
herself more admirably than any one I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish Miss Lavish would tell me herself. We started such friends. But
I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) ought to have run away with Baedeker that morning in
Santa Croce. Charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone,
and so I couldn't help being a little annoyed with Miss Lavish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The two ladies, at all events, have made it up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) was interested in the sudden friendship between women so apparently
dissimilar as Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish. They were always in each
other's company, with Lucy a slighted third. Miss Lavish he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) believed
he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) understood, but Miss Bartlett might reveal unknown depths of
strangeness, though not perhaps, of meaning. Was Italy deflecting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) from the path of prim chaperon, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) had assigned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) at
Tunbridge Wells? All his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) had loved to study maiden ladies;
they were his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) specialty, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) profession had provided him (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) with ample
opportunities for the work. Girls like Lucy were charming to look at,
but Mr. Beebe was, from rather profound reasons, somewhat chilly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>)
attitude towards the other sex, and preferred to be interested rather
than enthralled.

<p/>Lucy, for the third time, said that poor Charlotte would be sopped. The
Arno was rising in flood, washing away the traces of the little carts
upon the foreshore. But in the south-west there had appeared a dull haze
of yellow, which might mean better weather if it did not mean worse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
opened the window to inspect, and a cold blast entered the room, drawing
a plaintive cry from Miss Catharine Alan, who entered at the same moment
by the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear Miss Honeychurch, you will catch a chill! And Mr. Beebe here
besides. Who would suppose this is Italy? There is my sister actually
nursing the hot-water can; no comforts or proper provisions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) sidled towards them and sat down, self-conscious as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) always was
on entering a room which contained one man, or a man and one woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could hear your beautiful playing, Miss Honeychurch, though I was in
my room with the door shut. Doors shut; indeed, most necessary. No one
has the least idea of privacy in this country. And one person catches it
from another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy answered suitably. Mr. Beebe was not able to tell the ladies of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) adventure at Modena, where the chambermaid burst in upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>)
bath, exclaiming cheerfully, <div class="bookquote">``Fa niente, sono vecchia.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) contented
himself with saying: ``I quite agree with you, Miss Alan. The Italians
are a most unpleasant people. They pry everywhere, they see everything,
and they know what we want before we know it ourselves. We are at their
mercy. They read our thoughts, they foretell our desires. From the
cab-driver down to--to Giotto, they turn us inside out, and I resent
it. Yet in their heart of hearts they are--how superficial! They have no
conception of the intellectual life. How right is Signora Bertolini, who
exclaimed to me the other day: `Ho, Mr. Beebe, if you knew what I suffer
over the children's edjucaishion. HI won't `ave my little Victorier
taught by a hignorant Italian what can't explain nothink!'''

<p/>Miss Alan did not follow, but gathered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) was being mocked in an
agreeable way. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) sister was a little disappointed in Mr. Beebe, having
expected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and who
wore a pair of russet whiskers. Indeed, who would have supposed that
tolerance, sympathy, and a sense of humour would inhabit that militant
form?

<p/>In the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) satisfaction she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) continued to sidle, and at last
the cause was disclosed. From the chair beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) extracted
a gun-metal cigarette-case, on which were powdered in turquoise the
initials <div class="bookquote">``E. L.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That belongs to Lavish.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the clergyman. <div class="bookquote">``A good fellow, Lavish,
but I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>)'d start a pipe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Beebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Alan/Miss Catharine Alan/Miss Catharine</b></font>)</div>said Miss Alan, divided between awe and mirth. <div class="bookquote">``Indeed,
though it is dreadful for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) to smoke, it is not quite as dreadful as
you suppose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) took to it, practically in despair, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>)
life's work was carried away in a landslip. Surely that makes it more
excusable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>asked Lucy.

<p/>Mr. Beebe sat back complacently, and Miss Alan began as follows: <div class="bookquote">``It was
a novel--and I am afraid, from what I can gather, not a very nice novel.
It is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them, and I must say
they nearly always do. Anyhow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) left it almost finished in the Grotto
of the Calvary at the Capuccini Hotel at Amalfi while she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) went for a
little ink. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) said: `Can I have a little ink, please?' But you know
what Italians are, and meanwhile the Grotto fell roaring on to the
beach, and the saddest thing of all is that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) cannot remember what she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>)
has written. The poor thing was very ill after it, and so got tempted
into cigarettes. It is a great secret, but I am glad to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) is
writing another novel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) told Teresa and Miss Pole the other day that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) had got up all the local colour--this novel is to be about modern
Italy; the other was historical--but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) could not start till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>)
had an idea. First she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) tried Perugia for an inspiration, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) came
here--this must on no account get round. And so cheerful through it all!
I cannot help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone,
even if you do not approve of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Alan/Miss Catharine Alan/Miss Catharine</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Alan was always thus being charitable against her (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) better judgement.
A delicate pathos perfumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) disconnected remarks, giving them
unexpected beauty, just as in the decaying autumn woods there sometimes
rise odours reminiscent of spring. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) had made almost too many
allowances, and apologized hurriedly for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) toleration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All the same, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) is a little too--I hardly like to say unwomanly, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) behaved most strangely when the Emersons arrived.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe smiled as Miss Alan plunged into an anecdote which he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>)
would be unable to finish in the presence of a gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, Miss Honeychurch, if you have noticed that Miss Pole, the
lady who has so much yellow hair, takes lemonade. That old Mr. Emerson,
who puts things very strangely--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) jaw dropped. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) was silent. Mr. Beebe, whose social resources were
endless, went out to order some tea, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) continued to Lucy in a
hasty whisper:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stomach. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) warned Miss Pole of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pole</b></font>) stomach-acidity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) called it--and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) may have meant to be kind. I must say I forgot myself and laughed; it
was so sudden. As Teresa truly said, it was no laughing matter. But the
point is that Miss Lavish was positively ATTRACTED by his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) mentioning
S., and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) liked plain speaking, and meeting different grades of
thought. She (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) thought they were commercial travellers--`drummers' was the
word she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) used--and all through dinner she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) tried to prove that England,
our great and beloved country, rests on nothing but commerce. Teresa was
very much annoyed, and left the table before the cheese, saying as she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>)
did so: `There, Miss Lavish, is one who can confute you better than I,'
and pointed to that beautiful picture of Lord Tennyson. Then Miss
Lavish said: `Tut! The early Victorians.' Just imagine! `Tut! The early
Victorians.' My sister had gone, and I felt bound to speak. I said:
`Miss Lavish, I am an early Victorian; at least, that is to say, I
will hear no breath of censure against our dear Queen.' It was horrible
speaking. I reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) how the Queen had been to Ireland when she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) did
not want to go, and I must say she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) was dumbfounded, and made no reply.
But, unluckily, Mr. Emerson overheard this part, and called in his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) deep
voice: `Quite so, quite so! I honour the woman for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Irish visit.' The
woman! I tell things so badly; but you see what a tangle we were in
by this time, all on account of S. having been mentioned in the first
place. But that was not all. After dinner Miss Lavish actually came up
and said: `Miss Alan, I am going into the smoking-room to talk to those
two nice men. Come, too.' Needless to say, I refused such an unsuitable
invitation, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) had the impertinence to tell me that it would
broaden my ideas, and said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) had four brothers, all University
men, except one who was in the army, who always made a point of talking
to commercial travellers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me finish the story,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Beebe, who had returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Lavish tried Miss Pole, myself, everyone, and finally said:
`I shall go alone.' She (<font color='blue'><b>Pole</b></font>) went. At the end of five minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Pole</b></font>) returned
unobtrusively with a green baize board, and began playing patience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>cried Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No one knows. No one will ever know. Miss Lavish will never dare to
tell, and Mr. Emerson does not think it worth telling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Beebe--old Mr. Emerson, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) nice or not nice? I do so want to
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe laughed and suggested that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) should settle the question for
herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but it is so difficult. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) is so silly, and then I do not
mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>). Miss Alan, what do you think? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) nice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The little old lady shook her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head, and sighed disapprovingly. Mr.
Beebe, whom the conversation amused, stirred her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) up by saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I consider that you are bound to class him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) as nice, Miss Alan, after
that business of the violets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Violets? Oh, dear! Who told you about the violets? How do things get
round? A pension is a bad place for gossips. No, I cannot forget how
they behaved at Mr. Eager's lecture at Santa Croce. Oh, poor Miss
Honeychurch! It really was too bad. No, I have quite changed. I do NOT
like the Emersons. They are not nice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe smiled nonchalantly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) had made a gentle effort to introduce
the Emersons into Bertolini society, and the effort had failed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) was
almost the only person who remained friendly to them. Miss Lavish, who
represented intellect, was avowedly hostile, and now the Miss Alans,
who stood for good breeding, were following her (<font color='blue'><b>Alans</b></font>). Miss Bartlett, smarting
under an obligation, would scarcely be civil. The case of Lucy was
different. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) a hazy account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) adventures in Santa
Croce, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) gathered that the two men had made a curious and possibly
concerted attempt to annex her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) the world from their own
strange standpoint, to interest her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) in their private sorrows and joys.
This was impertinent; he (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) did not wish their cause to be championed by a
young girl: he (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) would rather it should fail. After all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) knew nothing
about them, and pension joys, pension sorrows, are flimsy things;
whereas Lucy would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) parishioner.

<p/>Lucy, with one eye upon the weather, finally said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thought the
Emersons were nice; not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw anything of them now. Even their
seats at dinner had been moved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But aren't they always waylaying you to go out with them, dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said
the little lady inquisitively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only once. Charlotte didn't like it, and said something--quite
politely, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most right of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). They don't understand our ways. They must find their
level.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe rather felt that they had gone under. They had given up their
attempt--if it was one--to conquer society, and now the father was
almost as silent as the son. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wondered whether he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would not plan a
pleasant day for these folk before they left--some expedition, perhaps,
with Lucy well chaperoned to be nice to them. It was one of Mr. Beebe's
chief pleasures to provide people with happy memories.

<p/>Evening approached while they chatted; the air became brighter; the
colours on the trees and hills were purified, and the Arno lost its
muddy solidity and began to twinkle. There were a few streaks of
bluish-green among the clouds, a few patches of watery light upon the
earth, and then the dripping facade of San Miniato shone brilliantly in
the declining sun.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Too late to go out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Alan/Miss Catharine Alan/Miss Catharine</b></font>)</div>said Miss Alan in a voice of relief. <div class="bookquote">``All the
galleries are shut.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I shall go out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``I want to go round the town in the
circular tram--on the platform by the driver.''

 (<font color='red'><b>companions</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) two companions looked grave. Mr. Beebe, who felt responsible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
in the absence of Miss Bartlett, ventured to say:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish we could. Unluckily I have letters. If you do want to go out
alone, won't you be better on your feet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Italians, dear, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Alan/Miss Catharine Alan/Miss Catharine</b></font>)</div>said Miss Alan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I shall meet someone who reads me through and through!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But they still looked disapproval, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) so far conceded to Mr. Beebe
as to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) would only go for a little walk, and keep to the
street frequented by tourists.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) oughtn't really to go at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Beebe, as they watched
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) from the window, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) knows it. I put it down to too much
Beethoven.''



 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter IV: Fourth Chapter

<p/>Mr. Beebe was right. Lucy never knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) desires so clearly as after
music. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had not really appreciated the clergyman's wit, nor the
suggestive twitterings of Miss Alan. Conversation was tedious; she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>)
wanted something big, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) believed that it would have come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) on
the wind-swept platform of an electric tram. This she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) might not attempt.
It was unladylike. Why? Why were most big things unladylike? Charlotte
had once explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) why. It was not that ladies were inferior
to men; it was that they were different. Their mission was to inspire
others to achievement rather than to achieve themselves. Indirectly, by
means of tact and a spotless name, a lady could accomplish much. But
if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rushed into the fray herself she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would be first censured, then
despised, and finally ignored. Poems had been written to illustrate this
point.

<p/>There is much that is immortal in this medieval lady. The dragons have
gone, and so have the knights, but still she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lingers in our midst. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
reigned in many an early Victorian castle, and was Queen of much early
Victorian song. It is sweet to protect her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) in the intervals of business,
sweet to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) honour when she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) has cooked our dinner well. But alas!
the creature grows degenerate. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) heart also there are springing
up strange desires. She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) too is enamoured of heavy winds, and vast
panoramas, and green expanses of the sea. She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) has marked the kingdom
of this world, how full it is of wealth, and beauty, and war--a radiant
crust, built around the central fires, spinning towards the receding
heavens. Men, declaring that she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) inspires them to it, move joyfully over
the surface, having the most delightful meetings with other men, happy,
not because they are masculine, but because they are alive. Before the
show breaks up she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) would like to drop the august title of the Eternal
Woman, and go there as her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) transitory self.

<p/>Lucy does not stand for the medieval lady, who was rather an ideal to
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was bidden to lift her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) eyes when feeling serious. Nor has
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) any system of revolt. Here and there a restriction annoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
particularly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would transgress it, and perhaps be sorry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
had done so. This afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was peculiarly restive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would really
like to do something of which her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) well-wishers disapproved. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) might
not go on the electric tram, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) went to Alinari's shop.

<p/>There she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) bought a photograph of Botticelli's <div class="bookquote">``Birth of Venus.''  (<font color='red'><b>Botticelli</b></font>)</div>Venus,
being a pity, spoilt the picture, otherwise so charming, and Miss
Bartlett had persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) to do without it. -LRB-A pity in art of course
signified the nude.-RRB- Giorgione's <div class="bookquote">``Tempesta,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>the <div class="bookquote">``Idolino,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>some of
the Sistine frescoes and the Apoxyomenos, were added to it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) felt
a little calmer then, and bought Fra Angelico's <div class="bookquote">``Coronation,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Giotto's
<div class="bookquote">``Ascension of St. John,''  (<font color='red'><b>Giotto</b></font>)</div>some Della Robbia babies, and some Guido
Reni Madonnas. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Della</b></font>) taste was catholic, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Della</b></font>) extended uncritical
approval to every well-known name.

<p/>But though she (<font color='blue'><b>Della</b></font>) spent nearly seven lire, the gates of liberty seemed
still unopened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Della</b></font>) was conscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Della</b></font>) discontent; it was new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Della</b></font>)
to be conscious of it. <div class="bookquote">``The world,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Della</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``is certainly full
of beautiful things, if only I could come across them.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was not
surprising that Mrs. Honeychurch disapproved of music, declaring that it
always left her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) daughter peevish, unpractical, and touchy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing ever happens to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) reflected, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) entered the Piazza
Signoria and looked nonchalantly at its marvels, now fairly familiar to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>). The great square was in shadow; the sunshine had come too late to
strike it. Neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight, half god,
half ghost, and his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who
idled together on its marge. The Loggia showed as the triple entrance of
a cave, wherein many a deity, shadowy, but immortal, looking forth
upon the arrivals and departures of mankind. It was the hour of
unreality--the hour, that is, when unfamiliar things are real. An older
person at such an hour and in such a place might think that sufficient
was happening to him (<font color='blue'><b>deity</b></font>), and rest content. Lucy desired more.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) eyes wistfully on the tower of the palace, which rose
out of the lower darkness like a pillar of roughened gold. It seemed
no longer a tower, no longer supported by earth, but some unattainable
treasure throbbing in the tranquil sky. Its brightness mesmerized her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>),
still dancing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) eyes when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) bent them to the ground and
started towards home.

<p/>Then something did happen.

<p/>Two Italians by the Loggia had been bickering about a debt. <div class="bookquote">``Cinque
lire,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they had cried, <div class="bookquote">``cinque lire!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They sparred at each other, and
one of them was hit lightly upon the chest. He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) frowned; he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) bent towards
Lucy with a look of interest, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had an important message for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) lips to deliver it, and a stream of red came out between
them and trickled down his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) unshaven chin.

<p/>That was all. A crowd rose out of the dusk. It hid this extraordinary
man from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), and bore him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) away to the fountain. Mr. George Emerson
happened to be a few paces away, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) across the spot where
the man had been. How very odd! Across something. Even as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) caught
sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grew dim; the palace itself grew dim, swayed above her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>),
fell on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) softly, slowly, noiselessly, and the sky fell with it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thought: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, what have I done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what have I done?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) murmured, and opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>George Emerson still looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), but not across anything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had
complained of dullness, and lo! one man was stabbed, and another held
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms.

<p/>They were sitting on some steps in the Uffizi Arcade. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must have
carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rose when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) spoke, and began to dust his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
repeated:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what have I done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You fainted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I am very sorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly well--absolutely well.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) began to nod and smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then let us come home. There's no point in our stopping.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand to pull her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) pretended not to see it. The
cries from the fountain--they had never ceased--rang emptily. The whole
world seemed pale and void of its original meaning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How very kind you have been! I might have hurt myself falling. But now
I am well. I can go alone, thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand was still extended.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my photographs!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) exclaimed suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What photographs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I bought some photographs at Alinari's. I must have dropped them out
there in the square.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cautiously. <div class="bookquote">``Would you add to
your kindness by fetching them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kindness. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had turned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back, Lucy arose
with the running of a maniac and stole down the arcade towards the Arno.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Honeychurch!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) stopped with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You sit still; you aren't fit to go home alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am, thank you so very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you aren't. You'd go openly if you were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I had rather--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I don't fetch your photographs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had rather be alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said imperiously: <div class="bookquote">``The man is dead--the man is probably dead; sit
down till you are rested.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was bewildered, and obeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And
don't move till I come back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In the distance she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw creatures with black hoods, such as appear in
dreams. The palace tower had lost the reflection of the declining day,
and joined itself to earth. How should she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) talk to Mr. Emerson when he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>)
returned from the shadowy square? Again the thought occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, what have I done?'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>--the thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), as well as the dying man,
had crossed some spiritual boundary.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returned, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) talked of the murder. Oddly enough, it was an easy
topic. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) spoke of the Italian character; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) became almost garrulous
over the incident that had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) faint five minutes before. Being
strong physically, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) soon overcame the horror of blood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) rose
without his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) assistance, and though wings seemed to flutter inside her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>),
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) walked firmly enough towards the Arno. There a cabman signalled to
them; they refused him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the murderer tried to kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>), you say--how very odd Italians
are!--and gave himself up to the police! Mr. Beebe was saying that
Italians know everything, but I think they are rather childish. When my
cousin and I were at the Pitti yesterday--What was that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had thrown something into the stream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you throw in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Things I didn't want,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) said crossly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Emerson!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are the photographs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe it was my photographs that you threw away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know what to do with them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) cried, and his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) voice was that
of an anxious boy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) heart warmed towards him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) for the first time.
<div class="bookquote">``They were covered with blood. There! I'm glad I've told you; and all
the time we were making conversation I was wondering what to do with
them.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) pointed down-stream. <div class="bookquote">``They've gone.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The river swirled under
the bridge, <div class="bookquote">``I did mind them so, and one is so foolish, it seemed better
that they should go out to the sea--I don't know; I may just mean that
they frightened me.''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>Then the boy verged into a man. <div class="bookquote">``For something
tremendous has happened; I must face it without getting muddled. It
isn't exactly that a man has died.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Something warned Lucy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) must stop him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has happened,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``and I mean to find out what it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Emerson--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) frowning, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had disturbed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in some
abstract quest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to ask you something before we go in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were close to their pension. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) stopped and leant her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) elbows
against the parapet of the embankment. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did likewise. There is at
times a magic in identity of position; it is one of the things that have
suggested to us eternal comradeship. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) elbows before saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have behaved ridiculously.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was following his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own thoughts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was never so much ashamed of myself in my life; I cannot think what
came over me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I nearly fainted myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) attitude
repelled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I owe you a thousand apologies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And--this is the real point--you know how silly people are
gossiping--ladies especially, I am afraid--you understand what I mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean, would you not mention it to any one, my foolish behaviour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your behaviour? Oh, yes, all right--all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you so much. And would you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) request any further. The river was rushing below
them, almost black in the advancing night. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had thrown her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) photographs
into it, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) the reason. It struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) that it was
hopeless to look for chivalry in such a man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would do her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) no harm by
idle gossip; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was trustworthy, intelligent, and even kind; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might
even have a high opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lacked chivalry; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts,
like his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) behaviour, would not be modified by awe. It was useless to say
to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``And would you--''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would complete the sentence
for himself, averting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) nakedness like the knight in
that beautiful picture. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had been in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembered it,
just as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembered the blood on the photographs that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had bought
in Alinari's shop. It was not exactly that a man had died; something
had happened to the living: they had come to a situation where character
tells, and where childhood enters upon the branching paths of Youth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, thank you so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``How quickly these accidents do
happen, and then one returns to the old life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Anxiety moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to question him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>).

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) answer was puzzling: <div class="bookquote">``I shall probably want to live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why, Mr. Emerson? What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall want to live, I say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Leaning her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) elbows on the parapet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) contemplated the River Arno,
whose roar was suggesting some unexpected melody to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) ears.



<p/>Chapter V: Possibilities of a Pleasant Outing

<p/>It was a family saying that <div class="bookquote">``you never knew which way Charlotte Bartlett
would turn.''  (<font color='red'><b>a family</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was perfectly pleasant and sensible over Lucy's
adventure, found the abridged account of it quite adequate, and paid
suitable tribute to the courtesy of Mr. George Emerson. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) and Miss
Lavish had had an adventure also. They had been stopped at the Dazio
coming back, and the young officials there, who seemed impudent and
desoeuvre, had tried to search their reticules for provisions. It might
have been most unpleasant. Fortunately Miss Lavish was a match for any
one.

<p/>For good or for evil, Lucy was left to face her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) problem alone. None
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) friends had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), either in the Piazza or, later on, by
the embankment. Mr. Beebe, indeed, noticing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) startled eyes at
dinner-time, had again passed to himself the remark of <div class="bookquote">``Too much
Beethoven.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) only supposed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was ready for an adventure,
not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had encountered it. This solitude oppressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was
accustomed to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thoughts confirmed by others or, at all events,
contradicted; it was too dreadful not to know whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was thinking
right or wrong.

<p/>At breakfast next morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) took decisive action. There were two plans
between which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had to choose. Mr. Beebe was walking up to the
Torre del Gallo with the Emersons and some American ladies. Would Miss
Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch join the party? Charlotte declined for
herself; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had been there in the rain the previous afternoon. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) thought it an admirable idea for Lucy, who hated shopping, changing
money, fetching letters, and other irksome duties--all of which Miss
Bartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Charlotte!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the girl, with real warmth. <div class="bookquote">``It's very kind of
Mr. Beebe, but I am certainly coming with you. I had much rather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett, with a faint flush of pleasure
that called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of Lucy. How
abominably she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) behaved to Charlotte, now as always! But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) should
alter. All morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would be really nice to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) slipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) arm into her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) cousin's, and they started off along the
Lung' Arno. The river was a lion that morning in strength, voice, and
colour. Miss Bartlett insisted on leaning over the parapet to look at
it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) then made her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) usual remark, which was <div class="bookquote">``How I do wish Freddy and
your mother could see this, too!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy fidgeted; it was tiresome of Charlotte to have stopped exactly
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look, Lucia! Oh, you are watching for the Torre del Gallo party. I
feared you would repent you of your choice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Serious as the choice had been, Lucy did not repent. Yesterday had been
a muddle--queer and odd, the kind of thing one could not write down
easily on paper--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had a feeling that Charlotte and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) shopping
were preferable to George Emerson and the summit of the Torre del
Gallo. Since she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could not unravel the tangle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) must take care not
to re-enter it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could protest sincerely against Miss Bartlett's
insinuations.

<p/>But though she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) had avoided the chief actor, the scenery unfortunately
remained. Charlotte, with the complacency of fate, led her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) from the
river to the Piazza Signoria. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could not have believed that stones, a
Loggia, a fountain, a palace tower, would have such significance. For a
moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) understood the nature of ghosts.

<p/>The exact site of the murder was occupied, not by a ghost, but by Miss
Lavish, who had the morning newspaper in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hailed them
briskly. The dreadful catastrophe of the previous day had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) an
idea which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) thought would work up into a book.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, let me congratulate you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett. <div class="bookquote">``After your despair
of yesterday! What a fortunate thing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aha! Miss Honeychurch, come you here I am in luck. Now, you are to tell
me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>Lucy poked at
the ground with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) parasol.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But perhaps you would rather not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry--if you could manage without it, I think I would rather not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The ladies</b></font>)</div><p/>The elder ladies exchanged glances, not of disapproval; it is suitable
that a girl should feel deeply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is I who am sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Lavish <div class="bookquote">``literary hacks are shameless
creatures. I believe there's no secret of the human heart into which we
wouldn't pry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) marched cheerfully to the fountain and back, and did a few
calculations in realism. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been in the
Piazza since eight o’clock collecting material. A good deal of it was
unsuitable, but of course one always had to adapt. The two men had
quarrelled over a five-franc note. For the five-franc note she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should
substitute a young lady, which would raise the tone of the tragedy, and
at the same time furnish an excellent plot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the heroine's name?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>asked Miss Bartlett.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leonora,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Lavish/Miss Eleanor Lavish</b></font>)</div>said Miss Lavish; her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) own name was Eleanor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>)'s nice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>That desideratum would not be omitted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is the plot?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Love, murder, abduction, revenge, was the plot. But it all came while
the fountain plashed to the satyrs in the morning sun.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you will excuse me for boring on like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Miss Lavish
concluded. <div class="bookquote">``It is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people.
Of course, this is the barest outline. There will be a deal of local
colouring, descriptions of Florence and the neighbourhood, and I shall
also introduce some humorous characters. And let me give you all fair
warning: I intend to be unmerciful to the British tourist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you wicked woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Bartlett. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure you are thinking
of the Emersons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Lavish gave a Machiavellian smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I confess that in Italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen.
It is the neglected Italians who attract me, and whose lives I am going
to paint so far as I can. For I repeat and I insist, and I have always
held most strongly, that a tragedy such as yesterday's is not the less
tragic because it happened in humble life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a fitting silence when Miss Lavish had concluded. Then the
cousins wished success to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) labours, and walked slowly away across the
square.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is my idea of a really clever woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett. <div class="bookquote">``That
last remark struck me as so particularly true. It should be a most
pathetic novel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy assented. At present her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) great aim was not to get put into it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
perceptions this morning were curiously keen, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) believed that Miss
Lavish had her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) on trial for an ingenue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is emancipated, but only in the very best sense of the word,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>continued Miss Bartlett slowly. <div class="bookquote">``None but the superficial would be
shocked at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). We had a long talk yesterday. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) believes in justice
and truth and human interest. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told me also that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has a high
opinion of the destiny of woman--Mr. Eager! Why, how nice! What a
pleasant surprise!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, not for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>said the chaplain blandly, <div class="bookquote">``for I have been watching
you and Miss Honeychurch for quite a little time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We were chatting to Miss Lavish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) brow contracted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So I saw. Were you indeed? Andate via! sono occupato!''  (<font color='red'><b>a vender</b></font>)</div>The last remark
was made to a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with a
courteous smile. <div class="bookquote">``I am about to venture a suggestion. Would you and
Miss Honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week--a
drive in the hills? We might go up by Fiesole and back by Settignano.
There is a point on that road where we could get down and have an
hour's ramble on the hillside. The view thence of Florence is most
beautiful--far better than the hackneyed view of Fiesole. It is the view
that Alessio Baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his (<font color='blue'><b>Baldovinetti</b></font>) pictures. That
man had a decided feeling for landscape. Decidedly. But who looks at it
to-day? Ah, the world is too much for us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett had not heard of Alessio Baldovinetti, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) knew
that Mr. Eager was no commonplace chaplain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) was a member of the
residential colony who had made Florence their home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) knew the people
who never walked about with Baedekers, who had learnt to take a siesta
after lunch, who took drives the pension tourists had never heard of,
and saw by private influence galleries which were closed to them. Living
in delicate seclusion, some in furnished flats, others in Renaissance
villas on Fiesole's slope, they read, wrote, studied, and exchanged
ideas, thus attaining to that intimate knowledge, or rather perception,
of Florence which is denied to all who carry in their pockets the
coupons of Cook.

<p/>Therefore an invitation from the chaplain was something to be proud of.
Between the two sections of his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) flock he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) was often the only link, and it
was his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) avowed custom to select those of his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) migratory sheep who seemed
worthy, and give them a few hours in the pastures of the permanent. Tea
at a Renaissance villa? Nothing had been said about it yet. But if it
did come to that--how Lucy would enjoy it!

<p/>A few days ago and Lucy would have felt the same. But the joys of life
were grouping themselves anew. A drive in the hills with Mr. Eager and
Miss Bartlett--even if culminating in a residential tea-party--was
no longer the greatest of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) echoed the raptures of Charlotte
somewhat faintly. Only when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) heard that Mr. Beebe was also coming did
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) thanks become more sincere.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So we shall be a partie carree,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>said the chaplain. <div class="bookquote">``In these days of
toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of
purity. Andate via! andate presto, presto! Ah, the town! Beautiful as it
is, it is the town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They assented.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This very square--so I am told--witnessed yesterday the most sordid of
tragedies. To one who loves the Florence of Dante and Savonarola
there is something portentous in such desecration--portentous and
humiliating.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Humiliating indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Honeychurch happened to
be passing through as it happened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) can hardly bear to speak of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) glanced at Lucy proudly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how came we to have you here?''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>asked the chaplain paternally.

<p/>Miss Bartlett's recent liberalism oozed away at the question. <div class="bookquote">``Do
not blame her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>), please, Mr. Eager. The fault is mine: I left her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>)
unchaperoned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you were here alone, Miss Honeychurch?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) voice suggested
sympathetic reproof but at the same time indicated that a few harrowing
details would not be unacceptable. His (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) dark, handsome face drooped
mournfully towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Practically.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Bartlett, adroitly concealing the sex of the preserver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) also it must have been a terrible experience. I trust that
neither of you was at all--that it was not in your immediate proximity?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Of the many things Lucy was noticing to-day, not the least remarkable
was this: the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble
after blood. George Emerson had kept the subject strangely pure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>) died by the fountain, I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you and your friend--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Were over at the Loggia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That must have saved you much. You have not, of course, seen the
disgraceful illustrations which the gutter Press--This man is a public
nuisance; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows that I am a resident perfectly well, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goes
on worrying me to buy his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vulgar views.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the vendor</b></font>)</div><p/>Surely the vendor of photographs was in league with Lucy--in the eternal
league of Italy with youth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) had suddenly extended his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) book before
Miss Bartlett and Mr. Eager, binding their hands together by a long
glossy ribbon of churches, pictures, and views.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is too much!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>cried the chaplain, striking petulantly at one of
Fra Angelico's angels. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) tore. A shrill cry rose from the vendor. The
book it seemed, was more valuable than one would have supposed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Willingly would I purchase--''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>began Miss Bartlett.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ignore him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Eager sharply, and they all walked rapidly away
from the square.

<p/>But an Italian can never be ignored, least of all when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) has a
grievance. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) mysterious persecution of Mr. Eager became relentless;
the air rang with his (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) threats and lamentations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) appealed to Lucy;
would not she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) intercede? He (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) was poor--he (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) sheltered a family--the tax on
bread. He (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) waited, he (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) gibbered, he (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) was recompensed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) was dissatisfied,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) did not leave them until he (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) had swept their minds clean of all
thoughts whether pleasant or unpleasant.

<p/>Shopping was the topic that now ensued. Under the chaplain's guidance
they selected many hideous presents and mementoes--florid little
picture-frames that seemed fashioned in gilded pastry; other little
frames, more severe, that stood on little easels, and were carven out
of oak; a blotting book of vellum; a Dante of the same material; cheap
mosaic brooches, which the maids, next Christmas, would never tell from
real; pins, pots, heraldic saucers, brown art-photographs; Eros and
Psyche in alabaster; St. Peter to match--all of which would have cost
less in London.

<p/>This successful morning left no pleasant impressions on Lucy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had
been a little frightened, both by Miss Lavish and by Mr. Eager, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knew
not why. And as they frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had, strangely enough, ceased
to respect them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) doubted that Miss Lavish was a great artist. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
doubted that Mr. Eager was as full of spirituality and culture as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
had been led to suppose. They were tried by some new test, and they were
found wanting. As for Charlotte--as for Charlotte she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was exactly the
same. It might be possible to be nice to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); it was impossible to love
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The son of a labourer; I happen to know it for a fact. A mechanic of
some sort himself when he (<font color='blue'><b>mechanic</b></font>) was young; then he (<font color='blue'><b>mechanic</b></font>) took to writing for the
Socialistic Press. I came across him (<font color='blue'><b>mechanic</b></font>) at Brixton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emersons</b></font>)</div><p/>They were talking about the Emersons.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How wonderfully people rise in these days!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>sighed Miss Bartlett,
fingering a model of the leaning Tower of Pisa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Generally,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Eager, <div class="bookquote">``one has only sympathy for their
success. The desire for education and for social advance--in these
things there is something not wholly vile. There are some working men
whom one would be very willing to see out here in Florence--little as
they would make of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>mechanic</b></font>) a journalist now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>Miss Bartlett asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>mechanic</b></font>) is not; he (<font color='blue'><b>mechanic</b></font>) made an advantageous marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) uttered this remark with a voice full of meaning, and ended with a
sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, so he (<font color='blue'><b>mechanic</b></font>) has a wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dead, Miss Bartlett, dead. I wonder--yes I wonder how he (<font color='blue'><b>mechanic</b></font>) has the
effrontery to look me in the face, to dare to claim acquaintance with
me. He (<font color='blue'><b>mechanic</b></font>) was in my London parish long ago. The other day in Santa Croce,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) was with Miss Honeychurch, I snubbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>). Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) beware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>)
does not get more than a snub.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>cried Lucy, flushing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exposure!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>hissed Mr. Eager.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) tried to change the subject; but in scoring a dramatic point he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had
interested his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) audience more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had intended. Miss Bartlett was
full of very natural curiosity. Lucy, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) wished never to see the
Emersons again, was not disposed to condemn them on a single word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) is an irreligious man? We know that
already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy, dear--''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett, gently reproving her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) cousin's
penetration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be astonished if you knew all. The boy--an innocent child at
the time--I will exclude. God knows what his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) education and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) inherited
qualities may have made him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett, <div class="bookquote">``it is something that we had better not
hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To speak plainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Eager, <div class="bookquote">``it is. I will say no more.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>For the
first time Lucy's rebellious thoughts swept out in words--for the first
time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have said very little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was my intention to say very little,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) frigid reply.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) gazed indignantly at the girl, who met him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) with equal indignation.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) from the shop counter; her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) breast heaved quickly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) observed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) brow, and the sudden strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) lips. It was
intolerable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) should disbelieve him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Murder, if you want to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) cried angrily. <div class="bookquote">``That man murdered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wife!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) retorted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To all intents and purposes he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) murdered her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). That day in Santa
Croce--did they say anything against me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a word, Mr. Eager--not a single word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I thought they had been libelling me to you. But I suppose it is
only their personal charms that makes you defend them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not defending them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) courage, and relapsing
into the old chaotic methods. <div class="bookquote">``They're nothing to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How could you think she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was defending them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett, much
discomfited by the unpleasant scene. The shopman was possibly listening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will find it difficult. For that man has murdered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife in the
sight of God.''

 (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div><p/>The addition of God was striking. But the chaplain was really trying
to qualify a rash remark. A silence followed which might have been
impressive, but was merely awkward. Then Miss Bartlett hastily purchased
the Leaning Tower, and led the way into the street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must be going,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>), shutting his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) eyes and taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) watch.

<p/>Miss Bartlett thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) kindness, and spoke with enthusiasm of
the approaching drive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Drive? Oh, is our drive to come off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy was recalled to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) manners, and after a little exertion the
complacency of Mr. Eager was restored.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bother the drive!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the girl, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had departed. <div class="bookquote">``It
is just the drive we had arranged with Mr. Beebe without any fuss at
all. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) invite us in that absurd manner? We might as well
invite him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>). We are each paying for ourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett, who had intended to lament over the Emersons, was
launched by this remark into unexpected thoughts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If that is so, dear--if the drive we and Mr. Beebe are going with Mr.
Eager is really the same as the one we are going with Mr. Beebe, then I
foresee a sad kettle of fish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because Mr. Beebe has asked Eleanor Lavish to come, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will mean another carriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Far worse. Mr. Eager does not like Eleanor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) knows it herself. The
truth must be told; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) is too unconventional for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were now in the newspaper-room at the English bank. Lucy stood by
the central table, heedless of Punch and the Graphic, trying to answer,
or at all events to formulate the questions rioting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) brain. The
well-known world had broken up, and there emerged Florence, a magic
city where people thought and did the most extraordinary things. Murder,
accusations of murder, a lady clinging to one man and being rude to
another--were these the daily incidents of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) streets? Was there more
in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) frank beauty than met the eye--the power, perhaps, to evoke
passions, good and bad, and to bring them speedily to a fulfillment?

<p/>Happy Charlotte, who, though greatly troubled over things that did not
matter, seemed oblivious to things that did; who could conjecture with
admirable delicacy <div class="bookquote">``where things might lead to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>but apparently lost
sight of the goal as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) approached it. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was crouching in the
corner trying to extract a circular note from a kind of linen nose-bag
which hung in chaste concealment round her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) neck. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had been told that
this was the only safe way to carry money in Italy; it must only
be broached within the walls of the English bank. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) groped she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
murmured: <div class="bookquote">``Whether it is Mr. Beebe who forgot to tell Mr. Eager, or Mr.
Eager who forgot when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) told us, or whether they have decided to leave
Eleanor out altogether--which they could scarcely do--but in any case
we must be prepared. It is you they really want; I am only asked for
appearances. You shall go with the two gentlemen, and I and Eleanor will
follow behind. A one-horse carriage would do for us. Yet how difficult
it is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl, with a gravity that sounded
sympathetic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think about it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>asked Miss Bartlett, flushed from the
struggle, and buttoning up her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) dress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what I think, nor what I want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, Lucy! I do hope Florence isn't boring you. Speak the word,
and, as you know, I would take you to the ends of the earth to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Charlotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, and pondered over the offer.

<p/>There were letters for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) at the bureau--one from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) brother, full
of athletics and biology; one from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother, delightful as only her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
mother's letters could be. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had read in it of the crocuses which had
been bought for yellow and were coming up puce, of the new parlour-maid,
who had watered the ferns with essence of lemonade, of the semi-detached
cottages which were ruining Summer Street, and breaking the heart of Sir
Harry Otway. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) recalled the free, pleasant life of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) home, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
was allowed to do everything, and where nothing ever happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).
The road up through the pine-woods, the clean drawing-room, the view
over the Sussex Weald--all hung before her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) bright and distinct, but
pathetic as the pictures in a gallery to which, after much experience, a
traveller returns.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the news?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>asked Miss Bartlett.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Vyse and her (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) son have gone to Rome,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, giving the news
that interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) least. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know the Vyses?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, not that way back. We can never have too much of the dear Piazza
Signoria.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They're nice people, the Vyses. So clever--my idea of what's really
clever. Don't you long to be in Rome?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I die for it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The Piazza Signoria is too stony to be brilliant. It has no grass,
no flowers, no frescoes, no glittering walls of marble or comforting
patches of ruddy brick. By an odd chance--unless we believe in a
presiding genius of places--the statues that relieve its severity
suggest, not the innocence of childhood, nor the glorious bewilderment
of youth, but the conscious achievements of maturity. Perseus and
Judith, Hercules and Thusnelda, they have done or suffered something,
and though they are immortal, immortality has come to them after
experience, not before. Here, not only in the solitude of Nature, might
a hero meet a goddess, or a heroine a god.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charlotte!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the girl suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``Here's an idea. What if we popped
off to Rome to-morrow--straight to the Vyses' hotel? For I do know what
I want. I'm sick of Florence. No, you said you'd go to the ends of the
earth! Do! Do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett, with equal vivacity, replied:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you droll person! Pray, what would become of your drive in the
hills?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>They passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square, laughing
over the unpractical suggestion.



<p/>Chapter VI: The Reverend Arthur Beebe, the Reverend Cuthbert Eager,
Mr. Emerson, Mr. George Emerson, Miss Eleanor Lavish, Miss Charlotte
Bartlett, and Miss Lucy Honeychurch Drive Out in Carriages to See a
View; Italians Drive Them.

<p/>It was Phaethon who drove them to Fiesole that memorable day, a youth
all irresponsibility and fire, recklessly urging his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) master's horses up
the stony hill. Mr. Beebe recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) at once. Neither the Ages of
Faith nor the Age of Doubt had touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) was Phaethon in Tuscany
driving a cab. And it was Persephone whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) asked leave to pick up on
the way, saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Persephone</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) sister--Persephone, tall and slender
and pale, returning with the Spring to her (<font color='blue'><b>Persephone</b></font>) mother's cottage, and still
shading her (<font color='blue'><b>Persephone</b></font>) eyes from the unaccustomed light. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Persephone</b></font>) Mr. Eager objected,
saying that here was the thin edge of the wedge, and one must guard
against imposition. But the ladies interceded, and when it had been made
clear that it was a very great favour, the goddess was allowed to mount
beside the god.

<p/>Phaethon at once slipped the left rein over her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) head, thus enabling
himself to drive with his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) waist. She (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) did not mind.
Mr. Eager, who sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) back to the horses, saw nothing of the
indecorous proceeding, and continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) conversation with Lucy. The
other two occupants of the carriage were old Mr. Emerson and Miss
Lavish. For a dreadful thing had happened: Mr. Beebe, without consulting
Mr. Eager, had doubled the size of the party. And though Miss Bartlett
and Miss Lavish had planned all the morning how the people were to sit,
at the critical moment when the carriages came round they lost their
heads, and Miss Lavish got in with Lucy, while Miss Bartlett, with
George Emerson and Mr. Beebe, followed on behind.

<p/>It was hard on the poor chaplain to have his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) partie carree thus
transformed. Tea at a Renaissance villa, if he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) had ever meditated it,
was now impossible. Lucy and Miss Bartlett had a certain style about
them, and Mr. Beebe, though unreliable, was a man of parts. But a shoddy
lady writer and a journalist who had murdered his (<font color='blue'><b>journalist</b></font>) wife in the sight of
God--they should enter no villa at his (<font color='blue'><b>journalist</b></font>) introduction.

<p/>Lucy, elegantly dressed in white, sat erect and nervous amid these
explosive ingredients, attentive to Mr. Eager, repressive towards Miss
Lavish, watchful of old Mr. Emerson, hitherto fortunately asleep, thanks
to a heavy lunch and the drowsy atmosphere of Spring. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) looked on the
expedition as the work of Fate. But for it she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would have avoided George
Emerson successfully. In an open manner he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) had shown that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) wished to
continue their intimacy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had refused, not because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) disliked him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>),
but because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did not know what had happened, and suspected that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>)
did know. And this frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).

<p/>For the real event--whatever it was--had taken place, not in the Loggia,
but by the river. To behave wildly at the sight of death is pardonable.
But to discuss it afterwards, to pass from discussion into silence,
and through silence into sympathy, that is an error, not of a startled
emotion, but of the whole fabric. There was really something blameworthy
-LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thought-RRB- in their joint contemplation of the shadowy stream, in the
common impulse which had turned them to the house without the passing of
a look or word. This sense of wickedness had been slight at first. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
had nearly joined the party to the Torre del Gallo. But each time that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) avoided George it became more imperative that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) should avoid
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) again. And now celestial irony, working through her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cousin and two
clergymen, did not suffer her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to leave Florence till she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had made this
expedition with him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) through the hills.

<p/>Meanwhile Mr. Eager held her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) in civil converse; their little tiff was
over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, Miss Honeychurch, you are travelling? As a student of art?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear me, no--oh, no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps as a student of human nature,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>interposed Miss Lavish, <div class="bookquote">``like
myself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no. I am here as a tourist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Eager. <div class="bookquote">``Are you indeed? If you will not think me
rude, we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little--handed
about like a parcel of goods from Venice to Florence, from Florence to
Rome, living herded together in pensions or hotels, quite unconscious
of anything that is outside Baedeker, their one anxiety to get `done'
or `through' and go on somewhere else. The result is, they mix up towns,
rivers, palaces in one inextricable whirl. You know the American girl
in Punch who says: `Say, poppa, what did we see at Rome?' And the father
replies: `Why, guess Rome was the place where we saw the yaller dog.'
There's travelling for you. Ha! ha! ha!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite agree,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Lavish, who had several times tried to
interrupt his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) mordant wit. <div class="bookquote">``The narrowness and superficiality of the
Anglo-Saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite so. Now, the English colony at Florence, Miss Honeychurch--and it
is of considerable size, though, of course, not all equally--a few are
here for trade, for example. But the greater part are students. Lady
Helen Laverstock is at present busy over Fra Angelico. I mention her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
name because we are passing her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) villa on the left. No, you can only see
it if you stand--no, do not stand; you will fall. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) is very proud of
that thick hedge. Inside, perfect seclusion. One might have gone back
six hundred years. Some critics believe that her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) garden was the scene of
The Decameron, which lends it an additional interest, does it not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It does indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Lavish. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me, where do they place the
scene of that wonderful seventh day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mr. Eager proceeded to tell Miss Honeychurch that on the right lived
Mr. Someone Something, an American of the best type--so rare!--and that
the Somebody Elses were farther down the hill. <div class="bookquote">``Doubtless you know
her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) monographs in the series of `Mediaeval Byways'? He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is working at
Gemistus Pletho. Sometimes as I take tea in their beautiful grounds I
hear, over the wall, the electric tram squealing up the new road with
its loads of hot, dusty, unintelligent tourists who are going to `do'
Fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there, and
I think--think--I think how little they think what lies so near them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>During this speech the two figures on the box were sporting with each
other disgracefully. Lucy had a spasm of envy. Granted that they wished
to misbehave, it was pleasant for them to be able to do so. They were
probably the only people enjoying the expedition. The carriage swept
with agonizing jolts up through the Piazza of Fiesole and into the
Settignano road.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Piano! piano!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Eager, elegantly waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Va bene, signore, va bene, va bene,''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>crooned the driver, and whipped
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) horses up again.

<p/>Now Mr. Eager and Miss Lavish began to talk against each other on the
subject of Alessio Baldovinetti. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) a cause of the Renaissance, or
was he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) one of its manifestations? The other carriage was left behind. As
the pace increased to a gallop the large, slumbering form of Mr. Emerson
was thrown against the chaplain with the regularity of a machine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Piano! piano!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>), with a martyred look at Lucy.

<p/>An extra lurch made him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) turn angrily in his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) seat. Phaethon, who for some
time had been endeavouring to kiss Persephone, had just succeeded.

<p/>A little scene ensued, which, as Miss Bartlett said afterwards, was
most unpleasant. The horses were stopped, the lovers were ordered to
disentangle themselves, the boy was to lose his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pourboire, the girl was
immediately to get down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) is my sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), turning round on them with piteous eyes.

<p/>Mr. Eager took the trouble to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) was a liar.

<p/>Phaethon hung down his (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) head, not at the matter of the accusation, but
at its manner. At this point Mr. Emerson, whom the shock of stopping
had awoke, declared that the lovers must on no account be separated, and
patted them on the back to signify his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) approval. And Miss Lavish, though
unwilling to ally him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>), felt bound to support the cause of Bohemianism.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Most certainly I would let them be,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``But I dare say I
shall receive scant support. I have always flown in the face of the
conventions all my life. This is what I call an adventure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must not submit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Eager. <div class="bookquote">``I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was trying it on. He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) is
treating us as if we were a party of Cook's tourists.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely no!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Lavish, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) ardour visibly decreasing.

<p/>The other carriage had drawn up behind, and sensible Mr. Beebe
called out that after this warning the couple would be sure to behave
themselves properly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave them alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>Mr. Emerson begged the chaplain, of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) stood
in no awe. <div class="bookquote">``Do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off the
box when it happens to sit there? To be driven by lovers--A king might
envy us, and if we part them it's more like sacrilege than anything I
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Here the voice of Miss Bartlett was heard saying that a crowd had begun
to collect.

<p/>Mr. Eager, who suffered from an over-fluent tongue rather than a
resolute will, was determined to make himself heard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) addressed the
driver again. Italian in the mouth of Italians is a deep-voiced stream,
with unexpected cataracts and boulders to preserve it from monotony.
In Mr. Eager's mouth it resembled nothing so much as an acid whistling
fountain which played ever higher and higher, and quicker and quicker,
and more and more shrilly, till abruptly it was turned off with a click.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Signorina!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man to Lucy, when the display had ceased. Why
should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appeal to Lucy?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Signorina!''  (<font color='red'><b>Persephone</b></font>)</div>echoed Persephone in her (<font color='blue'><b>Persephone</b></font>) glorious contralto. She (<font color='blue'><b>Persephone</b></font>) pointed at
the other carriage. Why?

<p/>For a moment the two girls looked at each other. Then Persephone got
down from the box.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Victory at last!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Eager, smiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) hands together as the
carriages started again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not victory,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Emerson. <div class="bookquote">``It is defeat. You have parted
two people who were happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Eager</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Eager shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) was obliged to sit next to Mr. Emerson, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) would not speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>). The old man was refreshed by sleep, and took
up the matter warmly. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) commanded Lucy to agree with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shouted
for support to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money. He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) has bargained
to drive us, and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is doing it. We have no rights over his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Lavish frowned. It is hard when a person you have classed as
typically British speaks out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) character.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was not driving us well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) jolted us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I deny. It was as restful as sleeping. Aha! he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is jolting us now.
Can you wonder? He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) would like to throw us out, and most certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is
justified. And if I were superstitious I'd be frightened of the girl,
too. It doesn't do to injure young people. Have you ever heard of
Lorenzo de Medici?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Lavish bristled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Most certainly I have. Do you refer to Lorenzo il Magnifico, or to
Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino, or to Lorenzo surnamed Lorenzino on account of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) diminutive stature?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``The Lord knows. Possibly he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) does know, for I refer to Lorenzo the poet.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) wrote a line--so I heard yesterday--which runs like this: `Don't go
fighting against the Spring.'''

<p/>Mr. Eager could not resist the opportunity for erudition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Non fate guerra al Maggio,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) murmured. ```War not with the May' would
render a correct meaning.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The point is, we have warred with it. Look.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pointed to the Val
d’Arno, which was visible far below them, through the budding trees.
<div class="bookquote">``Fifty miles of Spring, and we've come up to admire them. Do you suppose
there's any difference between Spring in nature and Spring in man? But
there we go, praising the one and condemning the other as improper,
ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>No one encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to talk. Presently Mr. Eager gave a signal for the
carriages to stop and marshalled the party for their ramble on the hill.
A hollow like a great amphitheatre, full of terraced steps and misty
olives, now lay between them and the heights of Fiesole, and the road,
still following its curve, was about to sweep on to a promontory which
stood out in the plain. It was this promontory, uncultivated, wet,
covered with bushes and occasional trees, which had caught the fancy of
Alessio Baldovinetti nearly five hundred years before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) had ascended
it, that diligent and rather obscure master, possibly with an eye to
business, possibly for the joy of ascending. Standing there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) had seen
that view of the Val d’Arno and distant Florence, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) afterwards
had introduced not very effectively into his (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) work. But where exactly had
he (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) stood? That was the question which Mr. Eager hoped to solve now. And
Miss Lavish, whose nature was attracted by anything problematical, had
become equally enthusiastic.

<p/>But it is not easy to carry the pictures of Alessio Baldovinetti in your
head, even if you have remembered to look at them before starting. And
the haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest.

<p/>The party sprang about from tuft to tuft of grass, their anxiety to keep
together being only equalled by their desire to go different directions.
Finally they split into groups. Lucy clung to Miss Bartlett and Miss
Lavish; the Emersons returned to hold laborious converse with the
drivers; while the two clergymen, who were expected to have topics in
common, were left to each other.

<p/>The two elder ladies soon threw off the mask. In the audible whisper
that was now so familiar to Lucy they began to discuss, not Alessio
Baldovinetti, but the drive. Miss Bartlett had asked Mr. George Emerson
what his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) profession was, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) had answered <div class="bookquote">``the railway.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) was very
sorry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) had no idea that it would be such a
dreadful answer, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) would not have asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>). Mr. Beebe had turned
the conversation so cleverly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) hoped that the young man was not
very much hurt at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) asking him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The railway!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>gasped Miss Lavish. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, but I shall die! Of course it
was the railway!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) could not control her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) mirth. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is the image of a
porter--on, on the South-Eastern.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eleanor, be quiet,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>plucking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) vivacious companion. <div class="bookquote">``Hush! They'll
hear--the Emersons--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't stop. Let me go my wicked way. A porter--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eleanor!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure it's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>put in Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``The Emersons won't hear, and
they wouldn't mind if they did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Lavish did not seem pleased at this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Honeychurch listening!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said rather crossly. <div class="bookquote">``Pouf! Wouf! You
naughty girl! Go away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Lucy, you ought to be with Mr. Eager, I'm sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't find them now, and I don't want to either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Eager will be offended. It is your party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, I'd rather stop here with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I agree,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Lavish. <div class="bookquote">``It's like a school feast; the boys
have got separated from the girls. Miss Lucy, you are to go. We wish to
converse on high topics unsuited for your ear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl was stubborn. As her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) time at Florence drew to its close she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
only at ease amongst those to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt indifferent. Such a one was
Miss Lavish, and such for the moment was Charlotte. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had
not called attention to herself; they were both annoyed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) remark
and seemed determined to get rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How tired one gets,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I do wish Freddy and your
mother could be here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Unselfishness with Miss Bartlett had entirely usurped the functions of
enthusiasm. Lucy did not look at the view either. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would not enjoy
anything till she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was safe at Rome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then sit you down,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Lavish. <div class="bookquote">``Observe my foresight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>With many a smile she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) produced two of those mackintosh squares that
protect the frame of the tourist from damp grass or cold marble steps.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sat on one; who was to sit on the other?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy; without a moment's doubt, Lucy. The ground will do for me. Really
I have not had rheumatism for years. If I do feel it coming on I shall
stand. Imagine your mother's feelings if I let you sit in the wet
in your white linen.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sat down heavily where the ground looked
particularly moist. <div class="bookquote">``Here we are, all settled delightfully. Even if my
dress is thinner it will not show so much, being brown. Sit down, dear;
you are too unselfish; you don't assert yourself enough.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cleared
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) throat. <div class="bookquote">``Now don't be alarmed; this isn't a cold. It's the tiniest
cough, and I have had it three days. It's nothing to do with sitting
here at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was only one way of treating the situation. At the end of five
minutes Lucy departed in search of Mr. Beebe and Mr. Eager, vanquished
by the mackintosh square.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) addressed herself to the drivers, who were sprawling in the
carriages, perfuming the cushions with cigars. The miscreant, a bony
young man scorched black by the sun, rose to greet her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) with the courtesy
of a host and the assurance of a relative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dove?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, after much anxious thought.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face lit up. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew where. Not so far either. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm
swept three-fourths of the horizon. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should just think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did know
where. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger-tips to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead and then pushed them
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), as if oozing with visible extract of knowledge.

<p/>More seemed necessary. What was the Italian for <div class="bookquote">``clergyman'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dove buoni uomini?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) at last.

<p/>Good? Scarcely the adjective for those noble beings! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
cigar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Uno--piu--piccolo,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) next remark, implying <div class="bookquote">``Has the cigar been
given to you by Mr. Beebe, the smaller of the two good men?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was correct as usual. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tied the horse to a tree, kicked it to make
it stay quiet, dusted the carriage, arranged his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair, remoulded his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
hat, encouraged his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moustache, and in rather less than a quarter of a
minute was ready to conduct her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). Italians are born knowing the way. It
would seem that the whole earth lay before them, not as a map, but as a
chess-board, whereon they continually behold the changing pieces as well
as the squares. Any one can find places, but the finding of people is a
gift from God.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) only stopped once, to pick her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) some great blue violets. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thanked
him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) with real pleasure. In the company of this common man the world
was beautiful and direct. For the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) felt the influence
of Spring. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm swept the horizon gracefully; violets, like other
things, existed in great profusion there; <div class="bookquote">``would she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) like to see them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ma buoni uomini.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bowed. Certainly. Good men first, violets afterwards. They proceeded
briskly through the undergrowth, which became thicker and thicker. They
were nearing the edge of the promontory, and the view was stealing round
them, but the brown network of the bushes shattered it into countless
pieces. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was occupied in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cigar, and in holding back the pliant
boughs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was rejoicing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) escape from dullness. Not a step, not a
twig, was unimportant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a voice in the wood, in the distance behind them. The voice
of Mr. Eager? He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) shoulders. An Italian's ignorance is
sometimes more remarkable than his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) knowledge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not make him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
understand that perhaps they had missed the clergymen. The view was
forming at last; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could discern the river, the golden plain, other
hills.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eccolo!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/>At the same moment the ground gave way, and with a cry she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) fell out of
the wood. Light and beauty enveloped her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had fallen on to a little
open terrace, which was covered with violets from end to end.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Courage!''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) companion, now standing some six feet above.
<div class="bookquote">``Courage and love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did not answer. From her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) feet the ground sloped sharply into view,
and violets ran down in rivulets and streams and cataracts, irrigating
the hillside with blue, eddying round the tree stems collecting into
pools in the hollows, covering the grass with spots of azure foam. But
never again were they in such profusion; this terrace was the well-head,
the primal source whence beauty gushed out to water the earth.

<p/>Standing at its brink, like a swimmer who prepares, was the good man.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not the good man that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had expected, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was alone.

<p/>George had turned at the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) arrival. For a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
contemplated her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), as one who had fallen out of heaven. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) saw radiant
joy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) face, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) saw the flowers beat against her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) dress in blue
waves. The bushes above them closed. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) stepped quickly forward and
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).

<p/>Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could speak, almost before she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could feel, a voice called,
<div class="bookquote">``Lucy! Lucy! Lucy!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The silence of life had been broken by Miss Bartlett
who stood brown against the view.



<p/>Chapter VII: They Return

<p/>Some complicated game had been playing up and down the hillside all the
afternoon. What it was and exactly how the players had sided, Lucy
was slow to discover. Mr. Eager had met them with a questioning eye.
Charlotte had repulsed him (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) with much small talk. Mr. Emerson, seeking
his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) son, was told whereabouts to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>). Mr. Beebe, who wore the
heated aspect of a neutral, was bidden to collect the factions for the
return home. There was a general sense of groping and bewilderment. Pan
had been amongst them--not the great god Pan, who has been buried these
two thousand years, but the little god Pan, who presides over social
contretemps and unsuccessful picnics. Mr. Beebe had lost everyone, and
had consumed in solitude the tea-basket which he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) had brought up as a
pleasant surprise. Miss Lavish had lost Miss Bartlett. Lucy had lost Mr.
Eager. Mr. Emerson had lost George. Miss Bartlett had lost a mackintosh
square. Phaethon had lost the game.

<p/>That last fact was undeniable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) climbed on to the box shivering, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) collar up, prophesying the swift approach of bad weather. <div class="bookquote">``Let us go
immediately,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) told them. <div class="bookquote">``The signorino will walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the way? He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) will be hours,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Beebe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Apparently. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) it was unwise.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) would look no one in the
face; perhaps defeat was particularly mortifying for him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) alone had
played skilfully, using the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) instinct, while the others
had used scraps of their intelligence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) alone had divined what things
were, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) wished them to be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) alone had interpreted the
message that Lucy had received five days before from the lips of a
dying man. Persephone, who spends half her (<font color='blue'><b>Persephone</b></font>) life in the grave--she (<font color='blue'><b>Persephone</b></font>) could
interpret it also. Not so these English. They gain knowledge slowly, and
perhaps too late.

<p/>The thoughts of a cab-driver, however just, seldom affect the lives of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) employers. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the most competent of Miss Bartlett's opponents,
but infinitely the least dangerous. Once back in the town, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
insight and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knowledge would trouble English ladies no more. Of
course, it was most unpleasant; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) had seen his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) black head in the
bushes; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might make a tavern story out of it. But after all, what have
we to do with taverns? Real menace belongs to the drawing-room. It
was of drawing-room people that Miss Bartlett thought as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) journeyed
downwards towards the fading sun. Lucy sat beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>); Mr. Eager sat
opposite, trying to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) eye; he (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) was vaguely suspicious. They spoke
of Alessio Baldovinetti.

<p/>Rain and darkness came on together. The two ladies huddled together
under an inadequate parasol. There was a lightning flash, and Miss
Lavish who was nervous, screamed from the carriage in front. At the next
flash, Lucy screamed also. Mr. Eager addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) professionally:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Courage, Miss Honeychurch, courage and faith. If I might say so, there
is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements. Are we
seriously to suppose that all these clouds, all this immense electrical
display, is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--of course--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being
struck are enormous. The steel knives, the only articles which might
attract the current, are in the other carriage. And, in any case, we are
infinitely safer than if we were walking. Courage--courage and faith.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Under the rug, Lucy felt the kindly pressure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cousin's hand. At
times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care
not what exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it
afterwards. Miss Bartlett, by this timely exercise of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) muscles,
gained more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) would have got in hours of preaching or cross
examination.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) renewed it when the two carriages stopped, half into Florence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Eager!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>called Mr. Beebe. <div class="bookquote">``We want your assistance. Will you
interpret for us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``George!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Emerson. <div class="bookquote">``Ask your driver which way George went. The
boy may lose his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) way. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) may be killed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go, Mr. Eager,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett, <div class="bookquote">``don't ask our driver; our driver is
no help. Go and support poor Mr. Beebe--, he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) is nearly demented.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) may be killed!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the old man. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) may be killed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Typical behaviour,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>said the chaplain, as he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) quitted the carriage. <div class="bookquote">``In
the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>whispered Lucy as soon as they were alone.
<div class="bookquote">``Charlotte, how much does Mr. Eager know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, dearest; he (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) knows nothing. But--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) pointed at the
driver-<div class="bookquote">``HE (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) knows everything. Dearest, had we better? Shall I?''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) took
out her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) purse. <div class="bookquote">``It is dreadful to be entangled with low-class people.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) saw it all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Phaethon</b></font>)</div>Tapping Phaethon's back with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) guide-book, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``Silenzio!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and offered him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) a franc.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Va bene,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) replied, and accepted it. As well this ending to his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) day
as any. But Lucy, a mortal maid, was disappointed in him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>).

<p/>There was an explosion up the road. The storm had struck the overhead
wire of the tramline, and one of the great supports had fallen. If they
had not stopped perhaps they might have been hurt. They chose to regard
it as a miraculous preservation, and the floods of love and sincerity,
which fructify every hour of life, burst forth in tumult. They descended
from the carriages; they embraced each other. It was as joyful to be
forgiven past unworthinesses as to forgive them. For a moment they
realized vast possibilities of good.

<p/>The older people recovered quickly. In the very height of their emotion
they knew it to be unmanly or unladylike. Miss Lavish calculated that,
even if they had continued, they would not have been caught in the
accident. Mr. Eager mumbled a temperate prayer. But the drivers, through
miles of dark squalid road, poured out their souls to the dryads and the
saints, and Lucy poured out hers to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cousin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charlotte, dear Charlotte, kiss me. Kiss me again. Only you can
understand me. You warned me to be careful. And I--I thought I was
developing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not cry, dearest. Take your time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been obstinate and silly--worse than you know, far worse. Once
by the river--Oh, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) isn't killed--he (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) wouldn't be killed, would he (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The thought disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) repentance. As a matter of fact, the storm was
worst along the road; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had been near danger, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thought
it must be near to everyone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I trust not. One would always pray against that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) is really--I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) was taken by surprise, just as I was before.
But this time I'm not to blame; I want you to believe that. I simply
slipped into those violets. No, I want to be really truthful. I am a
little to blame. I had silly thoughts. The sky, you know, was gold,
and the ground all blue, and for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Eager</b></font>) looked like someone in a
book.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a book?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heroes--gods--the nonsense of schoolgirls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Charlotte, you know what happened then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett was silent. Indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) had little more to learn. With a
certain amount of insight she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) young cousin affectionately
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>). All the way back Lucy's body was shaken by deep sighs, which
nothing could repress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to be truthful,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``It is so hard to be absolutely
truthful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be troubled, dearest. Wait till you are calmer. We will talk it
over before bed-time in my room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So they re-entered the city with hands clasped. It was a shock to the
girl to find how far emotion had ebbed in others. The storm had ceased,
and Mr. Emerson was easier about his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) son. Mr. Beebe had regained good
humour, and Mr. Eager was already snubbing Miss Lavish. Charlotte alone
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was sure of--Charlotte, whose exterior concealed so much insight and
love.

<p/>The luxury of self-exposure kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) almost happy through the long
evening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) thought not so much of what had happened as of how she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
should describe it. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sensations, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) spasms of courage, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
moments of unreasonable joy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mysterious discontent, should be
carefully laid before her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) cousin. And together in divine confidence they
would disentangle and interpret them all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At last,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I shall understand myself. I shan't again
be troubled by things that come out of nothing, and mean I don't know
what.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Alan asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) to play. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) refused vehemently. Music seemed to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) the employment of a child. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) sat close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) cousin, who, with
commendable patience, was listening to a long story about lost luggage.
When it was over she (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) capped it by a story of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) own. Lucy became rather
hysterical with the delay. In vain she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) tried to check, or at all events
to accelerate, the tale. It was not till a late hour that Miss Bartlett
had recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) luggage and could say in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) usual tone of gentle
reproach:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, dear, I at all events am ready for Bedfordshire. Come into my
room, and I will give a good brush to your hair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>With some solemnity the door was shut, and a cane chair placed for the
girl. Then Miss Bartlett said <div class="bookquote">``So what is to be done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) was unprepared for the question. It had not occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>)
would have to do anything. A detailed exhibition of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) emotions was all
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) had counted upon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is to be done? A point, dearest, which you alone can settle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>The rain was streaming down the black windows, and the great room felt
damp and chilly, One candle burnt trembling on the chest of drawers
close to Miss Bartlett's toque, which cast monstrous and fantastic
shadows on the bolted door. A tram roared by in the dark, and Lucy felt
unaccountably sad, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had long since dried her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) lifted
them to the ceiling, where the griffins and bassoons were colourless and
vague, the very ghosts of joy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been raining for nearly four hours,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said at last.

<p/>Miss Bartlett ignored the remark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you propose to silence him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The driver?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear girl, no; Mr. George Emerson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy began to pace up and down the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said at last.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) understood very well, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) no longer wished to be absolutely
truthful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you going to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) talking about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a feeling that talk is a thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) will never do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I, too, intend to judge him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) charitably. But unfortunately I have met
the type before. They seldom keep their exploits to themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exploits?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>cried Lucy, wincing under the horrible plural.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor dear, did you suppose that this was his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) first? Come here
and listen to me. I am only gathering it from his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) own remarks. Do you
remember that day at lunch when he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) argued with Miss Alan that liking one
person is an extra reason for liking another?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, whom at the time the argument had pleased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am no prude. There is no need to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) a wicked young man,
but obviously he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) is thoroughly unrefined. Let us put it down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>)
deplorable antecedents and education, if you wish. But we are no farther
on with our question. What do you propose to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>An idea rushed across Lucy's brain, which, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thought of it sooner
and made it part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), might have proved victorious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I propose to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).

<p/>Miss Bartlett uttered a cry of genuine alarm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, Charlotte, your kindness--I shall never forget it. But--as you
said--it is my affair. Mine and his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are going to IMPLORE him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>), to BEG him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) to keep silence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not. There would be no difficulty. Whatever you ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>)
answers, yes or no; then it is over. I have been frightened of him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>). But
now I am not one little bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we fear him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) for you, dear. You are so young and inexperienced, you
have lived among such nice people, that you cannot realize what men can
be--how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
sex does not protect and rally round. This afternoon, for example, if I
had not arrived, what would have happened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy gravely.

<p/>Something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) voice made Miss Bartlett repeat her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) question, intoning
it more vigorously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What would have happened if I hadn't arrived?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) insulted you, how would you have replied?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hadn't time to think. You came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but won't you tell me now what you would have done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) checked herself, and broke the sentence off. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
went up to the dripping window and strained her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) eyes into the darkness.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not think what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would have done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come away from the window, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett. <div class="bookquote">``You will be seen
from the road.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy obeyed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cousin's power. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not modulate out
the key of self-abasement in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had started. Neither of them
referred again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) suggestion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) should speak to George and
settle the matter, whatever it was, with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/>Miss Bartlett became plaintive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, for a real man! We are only two women, you and I. Mr. Beebe is
hopeless. There is Mr. Eager, but you do not trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). Oh, for your
brother! He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is young, but I know that his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister's insult would rouse
in him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) a very lion. Thank God, chivalry is not yet dead. There are still
left some men who can reverence woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) spoke, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) pulled off her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) rings, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) wore several, and
ranged them upon the pin cushion. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) blew into her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) gloves and
said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be a push to catch the morning train, but we must try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What train?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The train to Rome.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) gloves critically.

<p/>The girl received the announcement as easily as it had been given.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When does the train to Rome go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At eight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Signora Bertolini would be upset.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must face that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett, not liking to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) had
given notice already.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will make us pay for a whole week's pension.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I expect she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will. However, we shall be much more comfortable at the
Vyses' hotel. Isn't afternoon tea given there for nothing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but they pay extra for wine.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>After this remark she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) remained
motionless and silent. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) tired eyes Charlotte throbbed and swelled
like a ghostly figure in a dream.

<p/>They began to sort their clothes for packing, for there was no time to
lose, if they were to catch the train to Rome. Lucy, when admonished,
began to move to and fro between the rooms, more conscious of the
discomforts of packing by candlelight than of a subtler ill. Charlotte,
who was practical without ability, knelt by the side of an empty trunk,
vainly endeavouring to pave it with books of varying thickness and size.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) gave two or three sighs, for the stooping posture hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) back,
and, for all her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) diplomacy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was growing old. The girl
heard her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) entered the room, and was seized with one of those
emotional impulses to which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could never attribute a cause. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) only
felt that the candle would burn better, the packing go easier, the world
be happier, if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could give and receive some human love. The impulse
had come before to-day, but never so strongly. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knelt down by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
cousin's side and took her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms.

<p/>Miss Bartlett returned the embrace with tenderness and warmth. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>)
was not a stupid woman, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) knew perfectly well that Lucy did not
love her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), but needed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to love. For it was in ominous tones that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
said, after a long pause:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dearest Lucy, how will you ever forgive me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) guard at once, knowing by bitter experience what
forgiving Miss Bartlett meant. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) emotion relaxed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) modified her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>)
embrace a little, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charlotte dear, what do you mean? As if I have anything to forgive!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have a great deal, and I have a very great deal to forgive myself,
too. I know well how much I vex you at every turn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But no--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett assumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) favourite role, that of the prematurely aged
martyr.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but yes! I feel that our tour together is hardly the success I had
hoped. I might have known it would not do. You want someone younger
and stronger and more in sympathy with you. I am too uninteresting and
old-fashioned--only fit to pack and unpack your things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My only consolation was that you found people more to your taste, and
were often able to leave me at home. I had my own poor ideas of what a
lady ought to do, but I hope I did not inflict them on you more than was
necessary. You had your own way about these rooms, at all events.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mustn't say these things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy softly.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) still clung to the hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) and Charlotte loved each other,
heart and soul. They continued to pack in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been a failure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) struggled with the
straps of Lucy's trunk instead of strapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own. <div class="bookquote">``Failed to make you
happy; failed in my duty to your mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has been so generous to me;
I shall never face her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) again after this disaster.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But mother will understand. It is not your fault, this trouble, and it
isn't a disaster either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is my fault, it is a disaster. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will never forgive me, and
rightly. For instance, what right had I to make friends with Miss
Lavish?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When I was here for your sake? If I have vexed you it is equally true
that I have neglected you. Your mother will see this as clearly as I do,
when you tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy, from a cowardly wish to improve the situation, said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why need mother hear of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) everything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I do generally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare not break your confidence. There is something sacred in it.
Unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl would not be degraded to this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Naturally I should have told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). But in case she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should blame you in
any way, I promise I will not, I am very willing not to. I will never
speak of it either to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) or to any one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) promise brought the long-drawn interview to a sudden close. Miss
Bartlett pecked her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) smartly on both cheeks, wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) good-night, and
sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) own room.

<p/>For a moment the original trouble was in the background. George would
seem to have behaved like a cad throughout; perhaps that was the view
which one would take eventually. At present she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) neither acquitted nor
condemned him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) did not pass judgement. At the moment when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) was
about to judge him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) cousin's voice had intervened, and, ever since,
it was Miss Bartlett who had dominated; Miss Bartlett who, even
now, could be heard sighing into a crack in the partition wall;
Miss Bartlett, who had really been neither pliable nor humble nor
inconsistent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) had worked like a great artist; for a time--indeed,
for years--she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) had been meaningless, but at the end there was presented
to the girl the complete picture of a cheerless, loveless world in which
the young rush to destruction until they learn better--a shamefaced
world of precautions and barriers which may avert evil, but which do not
seem to bring good, if we may judge from those who have used them most.

<p/>Lucy was suffering from the most grievous wrong which this world has yet
discovered: diplomatic advantage had been taken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sincerity, of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) craving for sympathy and love. Such a wrong is not easily forgotten.
Never again did she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) expose herself without due consideration and
precaution against rebuff. And such a wrong may react disastrously upon
the soul.

<p/>The door-bell rang, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) started to the shutters. Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) reached
them she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hesitated, turned, and blew out the candle. Thus it was that,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw someone standing in the wet below, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) looked
up, did not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).

<p/>To reach his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) room he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had to go by hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was still dressed. It struck
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) might slip into the passage and just say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would
be gone before he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was up, and that their extraordinary intercourse was
over.

<p/>Whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would have dared to do this was never proved. At the
critical moment Miss Bartlett opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) own door, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) voice said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish one word with you in the drawing-room, Mr. Emerson, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Soon their footsteps returned, and Miss Bartlett said: <div class="bookquote">``Good-night, Mr.
Emerson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) heavy, tired breathing was the only reply; the chaperon had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>)
work.

<p/>Lucy cried aloud: <div class="bookquote">``It isn't true. It can't all be true. I want not to be
muddled. I want to grow older quickly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett tapped on the wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to bed at once, dear. You need all the rest you can get.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In the morning they left for Rome.




<p/>Part Two


<p/>Chapter VIII: Medieval

<p/>The drawing-room curtains at Windy Corner had been pulled to meet, for
the carpet was new and deserved protection from the August sun. They
were heavy curtains, reaching almost to the ground, and the light
that filtered through them was subdued and varied. A poet--none was
present--might have quoted, <div class="bookquote">``Life like a dome of many coloured glass,''
 (<font color='red'><b>A poet</b></font>)</div>or might have compared the curtains to sluice-gates, lowered against
the intolerable tides of heaven. Without was poured a sea of radiance;
within, the glory, though visible, was tempered to the capacities of
man.

<p/>Two pleasant people sat in the room. One--a boy of nineteen--was
studying a small manual of anatomy, and peering occasionally at a bone
which lay upon the piano. From time to time he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bounced in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) chair and
puffed and groaned, for the day was hot and the print small, and the
human frame fearfully made; and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother, who was writing a letter,
did continually read out to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had written. And continually
did she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rise from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seat and part the curtains so that a rivulet of
light fell across the carpet, and make the remark that they were still
there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where aren't they?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy Freddy</b></font>)</div>said the boy, who was Freddy, Lucy's brother. <div class="bookquote">``I
tell you I'm getting fairly sick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For goodness' sake go out of my drawing-room, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs.
Honeychurch, who hoped to cure her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) children of slang by taking it
literally.

<p/>Freddy did not move or reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think things are coming to a head,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) observed, rather wanting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) son's opinion on the situation if she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) could obtain it without undue
supplication.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Time they did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad that Cecil is asking her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) this once more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) third go, isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Freddy I do call the way you talk unkind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean to be unkind.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``But I do think Lucy might
have got this off her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) chest in Italy. I don't know how girls manage
things, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) can't have said `No' properly before, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) wouldn't
have to say it again now. Over the whole thing--I can't explain--I do
feel so uncomfortable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you indeed, dear? How interesting!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel--never mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) work.

<p/>``Just listen to what I have written to Mrs. Vyse. I said: `Dear Mrs.
Vyse.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mother, you told me. A jolly good letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I said: `Dear Mrs. Vyse, Cecil has just asked my permission about
it, and I should be delighted, if Lucy wishes it. But--''' She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) stopped
reading, <div class="bookquote">``I was rather amused at Cecil asking my permission at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>)

forth. When it comes to the point, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) can't get on without me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div><p/>Freddy nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) asked me for my permission also.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) exclaimed: <div class="bookquote">``How very odd of him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why so?''  (<font color='red'><b>the son heir</b></font>)</div>asked the son and heir. <div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't my permission be
asked?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you know about Lucy or girls or anything? What ever did you
say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I said to Cecil, `Take her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) or leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>); it's no business of mine!'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a helpful answer!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) own answer, though more normal in its
wording, had been to the same effect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The bother is this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>began Freddy.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) work again, too shy to say what the bother was. Mrs.
Honeychurch went back to the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Freddy, you must come. There they still are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see you ought to go peeping like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Peeping like that! Can't I look out of my own window?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) returned to the writing-table, observing, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>)
son, <div class="bookquote">``Still page 322?''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>Freddy snorted, and turned over two leaves. For a
brief space they were silent. Close by, beyond the curtains, the gentle
murmur of a long conversation had never ceased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The bother is this: I have put my foot in it with Cecil most awfully.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) gave a nervous gulp. <div class="bookquote">``Not content with `permission', which I did
give--that is to say, I said, `I don't mind'--well, not content with
that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) wanted to know whether I wasn't off my head with joy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>)
practically put it like this: Wasn't it a splendid thing for Lucy and
for Windy Corner generally if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) married her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)? And he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) would have an
answer--he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) said it would strengthen his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you gave a careful answer, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I answered `No''' said the boy, grinding his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) teeth. <div class="bookquote">``There! Fly into a
stew! I can't help it--had to say it. I had to say no. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ought never to
have asked me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ridiculous child!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``You think you're so holy and
truthful, but really it's only abominable conceit. Do you suppose that
a man like Cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say? I
hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) boxed your ears. How dare you say no?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, do keep quiet, mother! I had to say no when I couldn't say yes. I
tried to laugh as if I didn't mean what I said, and, as Cecil laughed
too, and went away, it may be all right. But I feel my foot's in it. Oh,
do keep quiet, though, and let a man do some work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Honeychurch, with the air of one who has considered the
subject, <div class="bookquote">``I shall not keep quiet. You know all that has passed between
them in Rome; you know why he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is down here, and yet you deliberately
insult him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and try to turn him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out of my house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) pleaded. <div class="bookquote">``I only let out I didn't like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I don't hate
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but I don't like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). What I mind is that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll tell Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) glanced at the curtains dismally.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Honeychurch. <div class="bookquote">``I know his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s
good, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s clever, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s rich, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s well connected--Oh, you needn't kick
the piano! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s well connected--I'll say it again if you like: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s
well connected.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) paused, as if rehearsing her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) eulogy, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) face
remained dissatisfied. She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has beautiful manners.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I liked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) till just now. I suppose it's having him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoiling Lucy's
first week at home; and it's also something that Mr. Beebe said, not
knowing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Beebe?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) mother, trying to conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) interest. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
see how Mr. Beebe comes in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know Mr. Beebe's funny way, when you never quite know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>)
means. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) said: `Mr. Vyse is an ideal bachelor.' I was very cute, I
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) meant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) said `Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>)'s like me--better detached.' I
couldn't make him (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) say any more, but it set me thinking. Since Cecil has
come after Lucy he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) hasn't been so pleasant, at least--I can't explain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You never can, dear. But I can. You are jealous of Cecil because he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) may
stop Lucy knitting you silk ties.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div><p/>The explanation seemed plausible, and Freddy tried to accept it. But at
the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) brain there lurked a dim mistrust. Cecil praised one too
much for being athletic. Was that it? Cecil made one talk in one's own
way. This tired one. Was that it? And Cecil was the kind of fellow who
would never wear another fellow's cap. Unaware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) own profundity,
Freddy checked himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) must be jealous, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) would not dislike a
man for such foolish reasons.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will this do?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>called his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) mother. ```Dear Mrs. Vyse,--Cecil has just
asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes
it.' Then I put in at the top, `and I have told Lucy so.' I must write
the letter out again--`and I have told Lucy so. But Lucy seems very
uncertain, and in these days young people must decide for themselves.' I
said that because I didn't want Mrs. Vyse to think us old-fashioned. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>)
goes in for lectures and improving her (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) mind, and all the time a thick
layer of flue under the beds, and the maid's dirty thumb-marks where you
turn on the electric light. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) keeps that flat abominably--''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose Lucy marries Cecil, would she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) live in a flat, or in the
country?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't interrupt so foolishly. Where was I? Oh yes--`Young people must
decide for themselves. I know that Lucy likes your son, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
tells me everything, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) wrote to me from Rome when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
first.' No, I'll cross that last bit out--it looks patronizing. I'll
stop at `because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) tells me everything.' Or shall I cross that out,
too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cross it out, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>said Freddy.

<p/>Mrs. Honeychurch left it in.

<p/>``Then the whole thing runs: `Dear Mrs. Vyse.--Cecil has just asked my
permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it, and
I have told Lucy so. But Lucy seems very uncertain, and in these days
young people must decide for themselves. I know that Lucy likes your
son, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) tells me everything. But I do not know--'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>cried Freddy.

<p/>The curtains parted.

<p/>Cecil's first movement was one of irritation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) couldn't bear the
Honeychurch habit of sitting in the dark to save the furniture.
Instinctively he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) give the curtains a twitch, and sent them swinging down
their poles. Light entered. There was revealed a terrace, such as is
owned by many villas with trees each side of it, and on it a little
rustic seat, and two flower-beds. But it was transfigured by the view
beyond, for Windy Corner was built on the range that overlooks the
Sussex Weald. Lucy, who was in the little seat, seemed on the edge of a
green magic carpet which hovered in the air above the tremulous world.

<p/>Cecil entered.

<p/>Appearing thus late in the story, Cecil must be at once described. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>)
was medieval. Like a Gothic statue. Tall and refined, with shoulders
that seemed braced square by an effort of the will, and a head that
was tilted a little higher than the usual level of vision, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) resembled
those fastidious saints who guard the portals of a French cathedral.
Well educated, well endowed, and not deficient physically, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>)
remained in the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows
as self-consciousness, and whom the medieval, with dimmer vision,
worshipped as asceticism. A Gothic statue implies celibacy, just as
a Greek statue implies fruition, and perhaps this was what Mr. Beebe
meant. And Freddy, who ignored history and art, perhaps meant the same
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) failed to imagine Cecil wearing another fellow's cap.

<p/>Mrs. Honeychurch left her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) letter on the writing table and moved towards
her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) young acquaintance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Cecil!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) exclaimed--<div class="bookquote">``oh, Cecil, do tell me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I promessi sposi,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>).

<p/>They stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) has accepted me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) said, and the sound of the thing in English
made him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) flush and smile with pleasure, and look more human.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Honeychurch, while Freddy proffered a hand
that was yellow with chemicals. They wished that they also knew Italian,
for our phrases of approval and of amazement are so connected with
little occasions that we fear to use them on great ones. We are obliged
to become vaguely poetic, or to take refuge in Scriptural reminiscences.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Welcome as one of the family!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Honeychurch, waving her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) hand
at the furniture. <div class="bookquote">``This is indeed a joyous day! I feel sure that you
will make our dear Lucy happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the young man, shifting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes to the ceiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We mothers--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>simpered Mrs. Honeychurch, and then realized that she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>)
was affected, sentimental, bombastic--all the things she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) hated most.
Why could she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) not be Freddy, who stood stiff in the middle of the room;
looking very cross and almost handsome?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, Lucy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>called Cecil, for conversation seemed to flag.

<p/>Lucy rose from the seat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) moved across the lawn and smiled in at
them, just as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was going to ask them to play tennis. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) brother's face. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) lips parted, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) arms. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``Steady on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a kiss for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother.

<p/>Lucy kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) also.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you take them into the garden and tell Mrs. Honeychurch all about
it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>Cecil suggested. <div class="bookquote">``And I'd stop here and tell my mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We go with Lucy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>said Freddy, as if taking orders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you go with Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They passed into the sunlight. Cecil watched them cross the terrace,
and descend out of sight by the steps. They would descend--he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) knew their
ways--past the shrubbery, and past the tennis-lawn and the dahlia-bed,
until they reached the kitchen garden, and there, in the presence of the
potatoes and the peas, the great event would be discussed.

<p/>Smiling indulgently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) lit a cigarette, and rehearsed the events that
had led to such a happy conclusion.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) had known Lucy for several years, but only as a commonplace girl
who happened to be musical. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) could still remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) depression that
afternoon at Rome, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) terrible cousin fell on him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) out
of the blue, and demanded to be taken to St. Peter's. That day she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had
seemed a typical tourist--shrill, crude, and gaunt with travel. But
Italy worked some marvel in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). It gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) light, and--which he (<font color='blue'><b>tourist</b></font>) held
more precious--it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) shadow. Soon he (<font color='blue'><b>tourist</b></font>) detected in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) a wonderful
reticence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was like a woman of Leonardo da Vinci's, whom we love
not so much for herself as for the things that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) will not tell us. The
things are assuredly not of this life; no woman of Leonardo's could have
anything so vulgar as a <div class="bookquote">``story.''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonardo</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did develop most wonderfully day by
day.

<p/>So it happened that from patronizing civility he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) had slowly passed if
not to passion, at least to a profound uneasiness. Already at Rome he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>)
had hinted to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that they might be suitable for each other. It had
touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) greatly that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not broken away at the suggestion.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) refusal had been clear and gentle; after it--as the horrid phrase
went--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been exactly the same to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) as before. Three months
later, on the margin of Italy, among the flower-clad Alps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) had asked
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) again in bald, traditional language. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) of a Leonardo
more than ever; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sunburnt features were shadowed by fantastic rock;
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) words she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had turned and stood between him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) and the light with
immeasurable plains behind her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) walked home with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) unashamed,
feeling not at all like a rejected suitor. The things that really
mattered were unshaken.

<p/>So now he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) once more, and, clear and gentle as ever, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>), giving no coy reasons for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) delay, but simply saying
that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) and would do her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) best to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) happy. His (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) mother,
too, would be pleased; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had counselled the step; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) must write her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a
long account.

<p/>Glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) hand, in case any of Freddy's chemicals had come off
on it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) moved to the writing table. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) saw <div class="bookquote">``Dear Mrs. Vyse,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>followed by many erasures. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) recoiled without reading any more, and
after a little hesitation sat down elsewhere, and pencilled a note on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) knee.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) lit another cigarette, which did not seem quite as divine as
the first, and considered what might be done to make Windy Corner
drawing-room more distinctive. With that outlook it should have been a
successful room, but the trail of Tottenham Court Road was upon it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>)
could almost visualize the motor-vans of Messrs. Shoolbred and Messrs.
Maple arriving at the door and depositing this chair, those varnished
book-cases, that writing-table. The table recalled Mrs. Honeychurch's
letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) did not want to read that letter--his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) temptations never lay
in that direction; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) worried about it none the less. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>)
own fault that she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) was discussing him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) mother; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) had wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>)
support in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) third attempt to win Lucy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) wanted to feel that others,
no matter who they were, agreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>), and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) had asked their
permission. Mrs. Honeychurch had been civil, but obtuse in essentials,
while as for Freddy--<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is only a boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) reflected. <div class="bookquote">``I represent all
that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) despises. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) want me for a brother-in-law?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Honeychurches a family</b></font>)</div><p/>The Honeychurches were a worthy family, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) began to realize
that Lucy was of another clay; and perhaps--he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) did not put it very
definitely--he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) ought to introduce her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) into more congenial circles as
soon as possible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Beebe!''  (<font color='red'><b>the maid rector</b></font>)</div>said the maid, and the new rector of Summer Street was
shown in; he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) had at once started on friendly relations, owing to Lucy's
praise of him (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) letters from Florence.

<p/>Cecil greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) rather critically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've come for tea, Mr. Vyse. Do you suppose that I shall get it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should say so. Food is the thing one does get here--Don't sit in that
chair; young Honeychurch has left a bone in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pfui!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil. <div class="bookquote">``I know. I can't think why Mrs. Honeychurch allows
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div><p/>For Cecil considered the bone and the Maples' furniture separately; he (<font color='blue'><b>Maples</b></font>)
did not realize that, taken together, they kindled the room into the
life that he (<font color='blue'><b>Maples</b></font>) desired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've come for tea and for gossip. Isn't this news?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``News? I don't understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil. <div class="bookquote">``News?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe, whose news was of a very different nature, prattled forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I met Sir Harry Otway as I came up; I have every reason to hope that I
am first in the field. He (<font color='blue'><b>Otway</b></font>) has bought Cissie and Albert from Mr. Flack!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Flack</b></font>) indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil, trying to recover himself. Into what a
grotesque mistake had he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) fallen! Was it likely that a clergyman and a
gentleman would refer to his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) engagement in a manner so flippant? But his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
stiffness remained, and, though he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) asked who Cissie and Albert might be,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Albert</b></font>) still thought Mr. Beebe rather a bounder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Unpardonable question! To have stopped a week at Windy Corner and not
to have met Cissie and Albert, the semi-detached villas that have been
run up opposite the church! I'll set Mrs. Honeychurch after you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm shockingly stupid over local affairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man
languidly. <div class="bookquote">``I can't even remember the difference between a Parish
Council and a Local Government Board. Perhaps there is no difference, or
perhaps those aren't the right names. I only go into the country to see
my friends and to enjoy the scenery. It is very remiss of me. Italy and
London are the only places where I don't feel to exist on sufferance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe, distressed at this heavy reception of Cissie and Albert,
determined to shift the subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me see, Mr. Vyse--I forget--what is your profession?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no profession,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil. <div class="bookquote">``It is another example of my
decadence. My attitude--quite an indefensible one--is that so long as I
am no trouble to any one I have a right to do as I like. I know I ought
to be getting money out of people, or devoting myself to things I don't
care a straw about, but somehow, I've not been able to begin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very fortunate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Beebe. <div class="bookquote">``It is a wonderful
opportunity, the possession of leisure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) voice was rather parochial, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) did not quite see his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) way to
answering naturally. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) felt, as all who have regular occupation must
feel, that others should have it also.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad that you approve. I daren't face the healthy person--for
example, Freddy Honeychurch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Freddy's a good sort, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Admirable. The sort who has made England what she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div><p/>Cecil wondered at himself. Why, on this day of all others, was he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) so
hopelessly contrary? He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) tried to get right by inquiring effusively after
Mr. Beebe's mother, an old lady for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) had no particular regard.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) flattered the clergyman, praised his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) liberal-mindedness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>)
enlightened attitude towards philosophy and science.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are the others?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Beebe at last, <div class="bookquote">``I insist on extracting
tea before evening service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose Anne never told them you were here. In this house one is so
coached in the servants the day one arrives. The fault of Anne is
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) begs your pardon when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hears you perfectly, and kicks the
chair-legs with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) feet. The faults of Mary--I forget the faults of
Mary, but they are very grave. Shall we look in the garden?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know the faults of Mary. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) leaves the dust-pans standing on the
stairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The fault of Euphemia is that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) will not, simply will not, chop the
suet sufficiently small.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They both laughed, and things began to go better.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The faults of Freddy--''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>Cecil continued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) has too many. No one but his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) mother can remember the faults of
Freddy. Try the faults of Miss Honeychurch; they are not innumerable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) has none,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, with grave sincerity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite agree. At present she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) has none.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At present?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not cynical. I'm only thinking of my pet theory about Miss
Honeychurch. Does it seem reasonable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) should play so
wonderfully, and live so quietly? I suspect that one day she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) will be
wonderful in both. The water-tight compartments in her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) will break down,
and music and life will mingle. Then we shall have her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) heroically good,
heroically bad--too heroic, perhaps, to be good or bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div><p/>Cecil found his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) companion interesting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And at present you think her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) not wonderful as far as life goes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I must say I've only seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) at Tunbridge Wells, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) was
not wonderful, and at Florence. Since I came to Summer Street she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) has
been away. You saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>), didn't you, at Rome and in the Alps. Oh, I
forgot; of course, you knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) before. No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) wasn't wonderful in
Florence either, but I kept on expecting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) would be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In what way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Conversation had become agreeable to them, and they were pacing up and
down the terrace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could as easily tell you what tune she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>)'ll play next. There was simply
the sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) had found wings, and meant to use them. I can show
you a beautiful picture in my Italian diary: Miss Honeychurch as a
kite, Miss Bartlett holding the string. Picture number two: the string
breaks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The sketch was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) diary, but it had been made afterwards, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>)
viewed things artistically. At the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) had given surreptitious tugs
to the string himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the string never broke?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I mightn't have seen Miss Honeychurch rise, but I should certainly
have heard Miss Bartlett fall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has broken now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man in low, vibrating tones.

<p/>Immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) realized that of all the conceited, ludicrous,
contemptible ways of announcing an engagement this was the worst. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
cursed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love of metaphor; had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suggested that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a star and
that Lucy was soaring up to reach him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Broken? What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I meant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil stiffly, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) is going to marry me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div><p/>The clergyman was conscious of some bitter disappointment which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) could
not keep out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry; I must apologize. I had no idea you were intimate with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>),
or I should never have talked in this flippant, superficial way. Mr.
Vyse, you ought to have stopped me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And down the garden he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) saw Lucy
herself; yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was disappointed.

<p/>Cecil, who naturally preferred congratulations to apologies, drew down
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) mouth at the corners. Was this the reception his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) action would get
from the world? Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) despised the world as a whole; every
thoughtful man should; it is almost a test of refinement. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
sensitive to the successive particles of it which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) encountered.

<p/>Occasionally he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could be quite crude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry I have given you a shock,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said dryly. <div class="bookquote">``I fear that
Lucy's choice does not meet with your approval.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not that. But you ought to have stopped me. I know Miss Honeychurch
only a little as time goes. Perhaps I oughtn't to have discussed her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) so
freely with any one; certainly not with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are conscious of having said something indiscreet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe pulled himself together. Really, Mr. Vyse had the art of
placing one in the most tiresome positions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) was driven to use the
prerogatives of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) profession.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I have said nothing indiscreet. I foresaw at Florence that her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>)
quiet, uneventful childhood must end, and it has ended. I realized dimly
enough that she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) might take some momentous step. She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) has taken it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>)
has learnt--you will let me talk freely, as I have begun freely--she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) has
learnt what it is to love: the greatest lesson, some people will tell
you, that our earthly life provides.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>It was now time for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) to wave
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) hat at the approaching trio. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) did not omit to do so. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) has
learnt through you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and if his (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) voice was still clerical, it was now
also sincere; <div class="bookquote">``let it be your care that her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) knowledge is profitable to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Grazie tante!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil, who did not like parsons.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you heard?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>shouted Mrs. Honeychurch as she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) toiled up the sloping
garden. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Beebe, have you heard the news?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div><p/>Freddy, now full of geniality, whistled the wedding march. Youth seldom
criticizes the accomplished fact.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I have!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) cried. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) looked at Lucy. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) presence he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) could
not act the parson any longer--at all events not without apology.
<div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Honeychurch, I'm going to do what I am always supposed to do, but
generally I'm too shy. I want to invoke every kind of blessing on
them, grave and gay, great and small. I want them all their lives to be
supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife, as father and
mother. And now I want my tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You only asked for it just in time,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the lady retorted. <div class="bookquote">``How dare you
be serious at Windy Corner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) tone from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). There was no more heavy beneficence, no more
attempts to dignify the situation with poetry or the Scriptures. None of
them dared or was able to be serious any more.

<p/>An engagement is so potent a thing that sooner or later it reduces all
who speak of it to this state of cheerful awe. Away from it, in the
solitude of their rooms, Mr. Beebe, and even Freddy, might again be
critical. But in its presence and in the presence of each other they
were sincerely hilarious. It has a strange power, for it compels not
only the lips, but the very heart. The chief parallel to compare one
great thing with another--is the power over us of a temple of some alien
creed. Standing outside, we deride or oppose it, or at the most feel
sentimental. Inside, though the saints and gods are not ours, we become
true believers, in case any true believer should be present.

<p/>So it was that after the gropings and the misgivings of the afternoon
they pulled themselves together and settled down to a very pleasant
tea-party. If they were hypocrites they did not know it, and their
hypocrisy had every chance of setting and of becoming true. Anne,
putting down each plate as if it were a wedding present, stimulated them
greatly. They could not lag behind that smile of hers which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) gave
them ere she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) kicked the drawing-room door. Mr. Beebe chirruped. Freddy
was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) wittiest, referring to Cecil as the <div class="bookquote">``Fiasco'' (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>--family honoured
pun on fiance. Mrs. Honeychurch, amusing and portly, promised well as
a mother-in-law. As for Lucy and Cecil, for whom the temple had been
built, they also joined in the merry ritual, but waited, as earnest
worshippers should, for the disclosure of some holier shrine of joy.



<p/>Chapter IX: Lucy As a Work of Art

<p/>A few days after the engagement was announced Mrs. Honeychurch made Lucy
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) Fiasco come to a little garden-party in the neighbourhood, for
naturally she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) wanted to show people that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) daughter was marrying a
presentable man.

<p/>Cecil was more than presentable; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) looked distinguished, and it was
very pleasant to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) slim figure keeping step with Lucy, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>)
long, fair face responding when Lucy spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>). People congratulated
Mrs. Honeychurch, which is, I believe, a social blunder, but it pleased
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) introduced Cecil rather indiscriminately to some stuffy
dowagers.

<p/>At tea a misfortune took place: a cup of coffee was upset over Lucy's
figured silk, and though Lucy feigned indifference, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother feigned
nothing of the sort but dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) indoors to have the frock treated
by a sympathetic maid. They were gone some time, and Cecil was left with
the dowagers. When they returned he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was not as pleasant as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) had been.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you go to much of this sort of thing?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) asked when they were
driving home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, now and then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, who had rather enjoyed herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it typical of country society?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so. Mother, would it be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Plenty of society,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Honeychurch, who was trying to remember
the hang of one of the dresses.

<p/>Seeing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) thoughts were elsewhere, Cecil bent towards Lucy and
said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To me it seemed perfectly appalling, disastrous, portentous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so sorry that you were stranded.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not that, but the congratulations. It is so disgusting, the way an
engagement is regarded as public property--a kind of waste place where
every outsider may shoot his (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) vulgar sentiment. All those old women
smirking!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One has to go through it, I suppose. They won't notice us so much next
time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But my point is that their whole attitude is wrong. An
engagement--horrid word in the first place--is a private matter, and
should be treated as such.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div><p/>Yet the smirking old women, however wrong individually, were racially
correct. The spirit of the generations had smiled through them,
rejoicing in the engagement of Cecil and Lucy because it promised the
continuance of life on earth. To Cecil and Lucy it promised something
quite different--personal love. Hence Cecil's irritation and Lucy's
belief that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) irritation was just.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How tiresome!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Couldn't you have escaped to tennis?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't play tennis--at least, not in public. The neighbourhood is
deprived of the romance of me being athletic. Such romance as I have is
that of the Inglese Italianato.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Inglese Italianato?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``E un diavolo incarnato! You know the proverb?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did not. Nor did it seem applicable to a young man who had spent a
quiet winter in Rome with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother. But Cecil, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) engagement,
had taken to affect a cosmopolitan naughtiness which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was far from
possessing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I cannot help it if they do disapprove of me. There
are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them, and I must
accept them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We all have our limitations, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said wise Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes they are forced on us, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil, who saw from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
remark that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did not quite understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) position.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It makes a difference doesn't it, whether we fully fence ourselves in,
or whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thought a moment, and agreed that it did make a difference.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Difference?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Honeychurch, suddenly alert. <div class="bookquote">``I don't see any
difference. Fences are fences, especially when they are in the same
place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We were speaking of motives,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil, on whom the interruption
jarred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Cecil, look here.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) spread out her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) knees and perched her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>)
card-case on her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) lap. <div class="bookquote">``This is me. That's Windy Corner. The rest of the
pattern is the other people. Motives are all very well, but the fence
comes here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We weren't talking of real fences,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I see, dear--poetry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) leant placidly back. Cecil wondered why Lucy had been amused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you who has no `fences,' as you call them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and
that's Mr. Beebe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy was slow to follow what people said, but quick enough to detect
what they meant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) missed Cecil's epigram, but grasped the feeling
that prompted it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you like Mr. Beebe?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) asked thoughtfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never said so!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I consider him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) far above the average. I
only denied--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) swept off on the subject of fences again, and was
brilliant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, a clergyman that I do hate,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) wanting to say something
sympathetic, <div class="bookquote">``a clergyman that does have fences, and the most dreadful
ones, is Mr. Eager, the English chaplain at Florence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was truly
insincere--not merely the manner unfortunate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was a snob, and so
conceited, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) did say such unkind things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What sort of things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was an old man at the Bertolini whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said had murdered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why `no'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was such a nice old man, I'm sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div><p/>Cecil laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) feminine inconsequence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I did try to sift the thing. Mr. Eager would never come to the
point. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) prefers it vague--said the old man had `practically' murdered
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife--had murdered her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in the sight of God.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Honeychurch absently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But isn't it intolerable that a person whom we're told to imitate
should go round spreading slander? It was, I believe, chiefly owing to
him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) that the old man was dropped. People pretended he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was vulgar, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
certainly wasn't that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor old man! What was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harris,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy glibly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's hope that Mrs. Harris there warn't no sich person,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
mother.

<p/>Cecil nodded intelligently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't Mr. Eager a parson of the cultured type?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). I've heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) lecture on Giotto. I hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).
Nothing can hide a petty nature. I HATE him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My goodness gracious me, child!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Honeychurch. <div class="bookquote">``You'll blow
my head off! Whatever is there to shout over? I forbid you and Cecil to
hate any more clergymen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) smiled. There was indeed something rather incongruous in Lucy's moral
outburst over Mr. Eager. It was as if one should see the Leonardo on the
ceiling of the Sistine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) longed to hint to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) that not here lay
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) vocation; that a woman's power and charm reside in mystery, not
in muscular rant. But possibly rant is a sign of vitality: it mars the
beautiful creature, but shows that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) is alive. After a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>)
contemplated her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) flushed face and excited gestures with a certain
approval. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) forebore to repress the sources of youth.

<p/>Nature--simplest of topics, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) thought--lay around them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) praised the
pine-woods, the deep lasts of bracken, the crimson leaves that spotted
the hurt-bushes, the serviceable beauty of the turnpike road. The
outdoor world was not very familiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>), and occasionally he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) went
wrong in a question of fact. Mrs. Honeychurch's mouth twitched when he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>)
spoke of the perpetual green of the larch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I count myself a lucky person,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) concluded, <div class="bookquote">``When I'm in London I
feel I could never live out of it. When I'm in the country I feel the
same about the country. After all, I do believe that birds and trees and
the sky are the most wonderful things in life, and that the people who
live amongst them must be the best. It's true that in nine cases out of
ten they don't seem to notice anything. The country gentleman and
the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of
companions. Yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings
of Nature which is denied to us of the town. Do you feel that, Mrs.
Honeychurch?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Honeychurch started and smiled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) had not been attending.
Cecil, who was rather crushed on the front seat of the victoria, felt
irritable, and determined not to say anything interesting again.

<p/>Lucy had not attended either. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) brow was wrinkled, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) still
looked furiously cross--the result, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) concluded, of too much moral
gymnastics. It was sad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thus blind to the beauties of an
August wood.

<p/>```Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height,''' he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) quoted, and
touched her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) knee with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) own.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) flushed again and said: <div class="bookquote">``What height?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>```Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height, What pleasure lives
in height -LRB-the shepherd sang-RRB-. In height and in the splendour of the
hills?' Let us take Mrs. Honeychurch's advice and hate clergymen no
more. What's this place?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Summer Street, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, and roused herself.

<p/>The woods had opened to leave space for a sloping triangular meadow.
Pretty cottages lined it on two sides, and the upper and third side was
occupied by a new stone church, expensively simple, a charming shingled
spire. Mr. Beebe's house was near the church. In height it scarcely
exceeded the cottages. Some great mansions were at hand, but they were
hidden in the trees. The scene suggested a Swiss Alp rather than the
shrine and centre of a leisured world, and was marred only by two ugly
little villas--the villas that had competed with Cecil's engagement,
having been acquired by Sir Harry Otway the very afternoon that Lucy had
been acquired by Cecil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cissie''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the name of one of these villas, <div class="bookquote">``Albert''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>of the other.
These titles were not only picked out in shaded Gothic on the garden
gates, but appeared a second time on the porches, where they followed
the semicircular curve of the entrance arch in block capitals. <div class="bookquote">``Albert''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was inhabited. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) tortured garden was bright with geraniums and
lobelias and polished shells. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) little windows were chastely swathed
in Nottingham lace. <div class="bookquote">``Cissie''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was to let. Three notice-boards, belonging
to Dorking agents, lolled on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) fence and announced the not surprising
fact. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) paths were already weedy; her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief of a lawn
was yellow with dandelions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The place is ruined!''  (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>said the ladies mechanically. <div class="bookquote">``Summer Street will
never be the same again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>As the carriage passed, <div class="bookquote">``Cissie's''  (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>door opened, and a gentleman came out
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Honeychurch, touching the coachman with her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) parasol.
<div class="bookquote">``Here's Sir Harry. Now we shall know. Sir Harry, pull those things down
at once!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Otway</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Harry Otway--who need not be described--came to the carriage and
said <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Honeychurch, I meant to. I can't, I really can't turn out
Miss Flack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Otway</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I not always right? She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) ought to have gone before the contract was
signed. Does she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) still live rent free, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) did in her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) nephew's time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what can I do?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Otway</b></font>) lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Otway</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``An old lady, so very vulgar,
and almost bedridden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Turn her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil bravely.

<p/>Sir Harry sighed, and looked at the villas mournfully. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had had full
warning of Mr. Flack's intentions, and might have bought the plot before
building commenced: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Flack</b></font>) was apathetic and dilatory. He (<font color='blue'><b>Flack</b></font>) had known
Summer Street for so many years that he (<font color='blue'><b>Flack</b></font>) could not imagine it being
spoilt. Not till Mrs. Flack had laid the foundation stone, and the
apparition of red and cream brick began to rise did he (<font color='blue'><b>Flack</b></font>) take alarm.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Flack</b></font>) called on Mr. Flack, the local builder,--a most reasonable and
respectful man--who agreed that tiles would have made more artistic
roof, but pointed out that slates were cheaper. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ventured to differ,
however, about the Corinthian columns which were to cling like leeches
to the frames of the bow windows, saying that, for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) part, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked
to relieve the facade by a bit of decoration. Sir Harry hinted that a
column, if possible, should be structural as well as decorative.

<p/>Mr. Flack replied that all the columns had been ordered, adding, <div class="bookquote">``and
all the capitals different--one with dragons in the foliage, another
approaching to the Ionian style, another introducing Mrs. Flack's
initials--everyone different.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Flack</b></font>)</div>For he (<font color='blue'><b>Flack</b></font>) had read his (<font color='blue'><b>Flack</b></font>) Ruskin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Flack</b></font>) built
his (<font color='blue'><b>Flack</b></font>) villas according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Flack</b></font>) desire; and not until he (<font color='blue'><b>Flack</b></font>) had inserted an
immovable aunt into one of them did Sir Harry buy.

<p/>This futile and unprofitable transaction filled the knight with sadness
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leant on Mrs. Honeychurch's carriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had failed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) duties
to the country-side, and the country-side was laughing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as well.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had spent money, and yet Summer Street was spoilt as much as ever.
All he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could do now was to find a desirable tenant for <div class="bookquote">``Cissie'' (<font color='red'><b>a tenant</b></font>)</div>--some
one really desirable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The rent is absurdly low,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told them, <div class="bookquote">``and perhaps I am an easy
landlord. But it is such an awkward size. It is too large for the
peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Cecil had been hesitating whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) should despise the villas or
despise Sir Harry for despising them. The latter impulse seemed the more
fruitful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to find a tenant at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said maliciously. <div class="bookquote">``It would be
a perfect paradise for a bank clerk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Otway</b></font>)</div>said Sir Harry excitedly. <div class="bookquote">``That is exactly what I fear, Mr.
Vyse. It will attract the wrong type of people. The train service has
improved--a fatal improvement, to my mind. And what are five miles from
a station in these days of bicycles?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather a strenuous clerk it would be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy.

<p/>Cecil, who had his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) full share of mediaeval mischievousness, replied
that the physique of the lower middle classes was improving at a
most appalling rate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was laughing at their harmless
neighbour, and roused herself to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``I have an idea. How would you like
spinsters?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Lucy, it would be splendid. Do you know any such?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I met them abroad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gentlewomen?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) asked tentatively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed, and at the present moment homeless. I heard from them last
week--Miss Teresa and Miss Catharine Alan. I'm really not joking. They
are quite the right people. Mr. Beebe knows them, too. May I tell them
to write to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed you may!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Here we are with the difficulty solved
already. How delightful it is! Extra facilities--please tell them they
shall have extra facilities, for I shall have no agents' fees. Oh,
the agents! The appalling people they have sent me! One woman, when
I wrote--a tactful letter, you know--asking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to explain her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) social
position to me, replied that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would pay the rent in advance. As
if one cares about that! And several references I took up were most
unsatisfactory--people swindlers, or not respectable. And oh, the
deceit! I have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week. The
deceit of the most promising people. My dear Lucy, the deceit!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My advice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>put in Mrs. Honeychurch, <div class="bookquote">``is to have nothing to do with
Lucy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) decayed gentlewomen at all. I know the type. Preserve me
from people who have seen better days, and bring heirlooms with them
that make the house smell stuffy. It's a sad thing, but I'd far rather
let to someone who is going up in the world than to someone who has
come down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I follow you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Otway</b></font>)</div>said Sir Harry; <div class="bookquote">``but it is, as you say, a very
sad thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Otway</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Misses Alan aren't that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>cried Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, they are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't met them but I should say they
were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>), Sir Harry--he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s tiresome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's I who am tiresome,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I oughtn't to come with my
troubles to young people. But really I am so worried, and Lady Otway
will only say that I cannot be too careful, which is quite true, but no
real help.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then may I write to my Misses Alan?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) eye wavered when Mrs. Honeychurch exclaimed:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beware! They are certain to have canaries. Sir Harry, beware of
canaries: they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then
the mice come. Beware of women altogether. Only let to a man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) murmured gallantly, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) saw the wisdom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>)
remark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Men don't gossip over tea-cups. If they get drunk, there's an end of
them--they lie down comfortably and sleep it off. If they're vulgar,
they somehow keep it to themselves. It doesn't spread so. Give me a
man--of course, provided he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s clean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Otway</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Harry blushed. Neither he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) nor Cecil enjoyed these open compliments
to their sex. Even the exclusion of the dirty did not leave them much
distinction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) suggested that Mrs. Honeychurch, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) had time, should
descend from the carriage and inspect <div class="bookquote">``Cissie''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>for herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) was
delighted. Nature had intended her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) to be poor and to live in such a
house. Domestic arrangements always attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>), especially when they
were on a small scale.

<p/>Cecil pulled Lucy back as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Honeychurch,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``what if we two walk home and leave you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cordial reply.

<p/>Sir Harry likewise seemed almost too glad to get rid of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) beamed
at them knowingly, said, <div class="bookquote">``Aha! young people, young people!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and then
hastened to unlock the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hopeless vulgarian!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Cecil, almost before they were out of
earshot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Cecil!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help it. It would be wrong not to loathe that man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) isn't clever, but really he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is nice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Lucy, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stands for all that is bad in country life. In London he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would keep his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) place. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would belong to a brainless club, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife
would give brainless dinner parties. But down here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) acts the little
god with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gentility, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) patronage, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sham aesthetics, and
everyone--even your mother--is taken in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All that you say is quite true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) felt
discouraged. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether--whether it matters so very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It matters supremely. Sir Harry is the essence of that garden-party.
Oh, goodness, how cross I feel! How I do hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'ll get some vulgar
tenant in that villa--some woman so really vulgar that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'ll notice
it. GENTLEFOLKS! Ugh! with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bald head and retreating chin! But let's
forget him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>This Lucy was glad enough to do. If Cecil disliked Sir Harry Otway and
Mr. Beebe, what guarantee was there that the people who really mattered
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would escape? For instance, Freddy. Freddy was neither clever,
nor subtle, nor beautiful, and what prevented Cecil from saying, any
minute, <div class="bookquote">``It would be wrong not to loathe Freddy'' (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>? And what would she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
reply? Further than Freddy she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did not go, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) anxiety
enough. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could only assure herself that Cecil had known Freddy some
time, and that they had always got on pleasantly, except, perhaps,
during the last few days, which was an accident, perhaps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which way shall we go?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>).

<p/>Nature--simplest of topics, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thought--was around them. Summer Street
lay deep in the woods, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had stopped where a footpath diverged
from the highroad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are there two ways?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps the road is more sensible, as we're got up smart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd rather go through the wood,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil, With that subdued
irritation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had noticed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) all the afternoon. <div class="bookquote">``Why is it,
Lucy, that you always say the road? Do you know that you have never once
been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't I? The wood, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, startled at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) queerness, but
pretty sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) would explain later; it was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) habit to leave
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) in doubt as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) meaning.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) led the way into the whispering pines, and sure enough he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) did
explain before they had gone a dozen yards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had got an idea--I dare say wrongly--that you feel more at home with
me in a room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A room?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) echoed, hopelessly bewildered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Or, at the most, in a garden, or on a road. Never in the real
country like this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean? I have never felt anything of the
sort. You talk as if I was a kind of poetess sort of person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that you aren't. I connect you with a view--a certain type
of view. Why shouldn't you connect me with a room?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) reflected a moment, and then said, laughing:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know that you're right? I do. I must be a poetess after all.
When I think of you it's always as in a room. How funny!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) surprise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) seemed annoyed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A drawing-room, pray? With no view?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, with no view, I fancy. Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd rather,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) said reproachfully, <div class="bookquote">``that you connected me with the open
air.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said again, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>As no explanation was forthcoming, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) shook off the subject as too
difficult for a girl, and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) further into the wood, pausing every
now and then at some particularly beautiful or familiar combination of
the trees. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had known the wood between Summer Street and Windy Corner
ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) could walk alone; she (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) had played at losing Freddy in it,
when Freddy was a purple-faced baby; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) had been to Italy,
it had lost none of its charm.

<p/>Presently they came to a little clearing among the pines--another tiny
green alp, solitary this time, and holding in its bosom a shallow pool.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``The Sacred Lake!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you call it that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't remember why. I suppose it comes out of some book. It's only a
puddle now, but you see that stream going through it? Well, a good deal
of water comes down after heavy rains, and can't get away at once, and
the pool becomes quite large and beautiful. Then Freddy used to bathe
there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) is very fond of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) meant, <div class="bookquote">``Are you fond of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) answered dreamily, <div class="bookquote">``I bathed
here, too, till I was found out. Then there was a row.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>At another time he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) might have been shocked, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) had depths of
prudishness within him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>). But now? with his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) momentary cult of the fresh
air, he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) was delighted at her (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) admirable simplicity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) stood by the pool's edge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) was got up smart, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) phrased it,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) of some brilliant flower that has no leaves of its
own, but blooms abruptly out of a world of green.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who found you out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Charlotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was stopping with us.
Charlotte--Charlotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor girl!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) smiled gravely. A certain scheme, from which hitherto he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) had shrunk,
now appeared practical.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I suppose we ought to be going,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy, I want to ask something of you that I have never asked before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>At the serious note in his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) voice she (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) stepped frankly and kindly towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, Cecil?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hitherto never--not even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry
me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) became self-conscious and kept glancing round to see if they were
observed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) courage had gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Up to now I have never kissed you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) was as scarlet as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) had put the thing most indelicately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--more you have,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) stammered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I ask you--may I now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, you may, Cecil. You might before. I can't run at you, you
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At that supreme moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) was conscious of nothing but absurdities. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>)
reply was inadequate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) gave such a business-like lift to her (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) veil.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) found time to wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) could recoil. As
he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) gold pince-nez became dislodged and was flattened
between them.

<p/>Such was the embrace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) considered, with truth, that it had been a
failure. Passion should believe itself irresistible. It should forget
civility and consideration and all the other curses of a refined nature.
Above all, it should never ask for leave where there is a right of way.
Why could he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) not do as any labourer or navvy--nay, as any young man
behind the counter would have done? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recast the scene. Lucy was
standing flowerlike by the water, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rushed up and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
arms; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) rebuked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), permitted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and revered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ever after for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
manliness. For he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed that women revere men for their manliness.

<p/>They left the pool in silence, after this one salutation. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waited for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to make some remark which should show him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) inmost thoughts. At
last she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) spoke, and with fitting gravity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Emerson was the name, not Harris.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The old man's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What old man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That old man I told you about. The one Mr. Eager was so unkind to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not know that this was the most intimate conversation they had
ever had.



<p/>Chapter X: Cecil as a Humourist

<p/>The society out of which Cecil proposed to rescue Lucy was perhaps no
very splendid affair, yet it was more splendid than her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) antecedents
entitled her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) father, a prosperous local solicitor, had built
Windy Corner, as a speculation at the time the district was opening up,
and, falling in love with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own creation, had ended by living there
himself. Soon after his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) marriage the social atmosphere began to alter.
Other houses were built on the brow of that steep southern slope and
others, again, among the pine-trees behind, and northward on the chalk
barrier of the downs. Most of these houses were larger than Windy
Corner, and were filled by people who came, not from the district, but
from London, and who mistook the Honeychurches for the remnants of an
indigenous aristocracy. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was inclined to be frightened, but his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife
accepted the situation without either pride or humility. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot think
what people are doing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``but it is extremely fortunate
for the children.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) called everywhere; her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) calls were returned with
enthusiasm, and by the time people found out that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was not exactly
of their milieu, they liked her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and it did not seem to matter. When Mr.
Honeychurch died, he (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) had the satisfaction--which few honest solicitors
despise--of leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) family rooted in the best society obtainable.

<p/>The best obtainable. Certainly many of the immigrants were rather
dull, and Lucy realized this more vividly since her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) return from Italy.
Hitherto she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had accepted their ideals without questioning--their kindly
affluence, their inexplosive religion, their dislike of paper-bags,
orange-peel, and broken bottles. A Radical out and out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) learnt to
speak with horror of Suburbia. Life, so far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) troubled to conceive
it, was a circle of rich, pleasant people, with identical interests and
identical foes. In this circle, one thought, married, and died. Outside
it were poverty and vulgarity for ever trying to enter, just as the
London fog tries to enter the pine-woods pouring through the gaps in
the northern hills. But, in Italy, where any one who chooses may warm
himself in equality, as in the sun, this conception of life vanished.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) senses expanded; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) felt that there was no one whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) might not
get to like, that social barriers were irremovable, doubtless, but not
particularly high. You jump over them just as you jump into a peasant's
olive-yard in the Apennines, and he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) is glad to see you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) returned
with new eyes.

<p/>So did Cecil; but Italy had quickened Cecil, not to tolerance, but to
irritation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) saw that the local society was narrow, but, instead
of saying, <div class="bookquote">``Does that very much matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) rebelled, and tried to
substitute for it the society he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) called broad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) did not realize that
Lucy had consecrated her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) environment by the thousand little civilities
that create a tenderness in time, and that though her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) eyes saw its
defects, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) heart refused to despise it entirely. Nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) realize
a more important point--that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was too great for this society, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
was too great for all society, and had reached the stage where personal
intercourse would alone satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). A rebel she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was, but not of the
kind he (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>) understood--a rebel who desired, not a wider dwelling-room, but
equality beside the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) loved. For Italy was offering her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) the most
priceless of all possessions--her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own soul.

<p/>Playing bumble-puppy with Minnie Beebe, niece to the rector, and
aged thirteen--an ancient and most honourable game, which consists in
striking tennis-balls high into the air, so that they fall over the net
and immoderately bounce; some hit Mrs. Honeychurch; others are lost. The
sentence is confused, but the better illustrates Lucy's state of mind,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was trying to talk to Mr. Beebe at the same time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it has been such a nuisance--first he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), then they--no one knowing
what they wanted, and everyone so tiresome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But they really are coming now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Beebe. ``I wrote to Miss
Teresa a few days ago--she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) was wondering how often the butcher called,
and my reply of once a month must have impressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) favourably. They
are coming. I heard from them this morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall hate those Miss Alans!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Honeychurch cried. <div class="bookquote">``Just because
they're old and silly one's expected to say `How sweet!' I hate
their `if'-ing and `but'-ing and `and'-ing. And poor Lucy--serve her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
right--worn to a shadow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe watched the shadow springing and shouting over the
tennis-court. Cecil was absent--one did not play bumble-puppy when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>)
was there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if they are coming--No, Minnie, not Saturn.''  (<font color='red'><b>Saturn</b></font>)</div>Saturn was a
tennis-ball whose skin was partially unsewn. When in motion his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) orb was
encircled by a ring. <div class="bookquote">``If they are coming, Sir Harry will let them move
in before the twenty-ninth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) will cross out the clause about
whitewashing the ceilings, because it made them nervous, and put in the
fair wear and tear one.--That doesn't count. I told you not Saturn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Saturn's all right for bumble-puppy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>cried Freddy, joining them.
<div class="bookquote">``Minnie, don't you listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Saturn doesn't bounce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Saturn bounces enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) doesn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bounces better than the Beautiful White Devil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Honeychurch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But look at Lucy--complaining of Saturn, and all the time's got the
Beautiful White Devil in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hand, ready to plug it in. That's right,
Minnie, go for her (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>)--get her (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>) over the shins with the racquet--get her (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>)
over the shins!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy fell, the Beautiful White Devil rolled from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hand.

<p/>Mr. Beebe picked it up, and said: <div class="bookquote">``The name of this ball is Vittoria
Corombona, please.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) correction passed unheeded.

<p/>Freddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls
to fury, and in half a minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) had transformed Minnie from a
well-mannered child into a howling wilderness. Up in the house Cecil
heard them, and, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was full of entertaining news, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) did not
come down to impart it, in case he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) got hurt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was not a coward and
bore necessary pain as well as any man. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hated the physical
violence of the young. How right it was! Sure enough it ended in a cry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish the Miss Alans could see this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Beebe, just as
Lucy, who was nursing the injured Minnie, was in turn lifted off her (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>)
feet by her (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>) brother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are the Miss Alans?''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>Freddy panted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They have taken Cissie Villa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That wasn't the name--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Here his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) foot slipped, and they all fell most agreeably on to the grass.
An interval elapses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wasn't what name?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>asked Lucy, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) brother's head in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) lap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alan wasn't the name of the people Sir Harry's let to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Freddy! You know nothing about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense yourself! I've this minute seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) said to me: `Ahem!
Honeychurch,'''--Freddy was an indifferent mimic--```ahem! ahem! I have at
last procured really dee-sire-rebel tenants.' I said, `ooray, old boy!'
and slapped him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) on the back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly. The Miss Alans?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather not. More like Anderson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, good gracious, there isn't going to be another muddle!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Honeychurch exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Do you notice, Lucy, I'm always right? I said
don't interfere with Cissie Villa. I'm always right. I'm quite uneasy at
being always right so often.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only another muddle of Freddy's. Freddy doesn't even know the name
of the people he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) pretends have taken it instead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do. I've got it. Emerson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Emerson. I'll bet you anything you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a weathercock Sir Harry is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy quietly. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I had
never bothered over it at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) back and gazed at the cloudless sky. Mr. Beebe,
whose opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) rose daily, whispered to his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) niece that THAT was
the proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong.

<p/>Meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted Mrs. Honeychurch from
the contemplation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) own abilities.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Emerson, Freddy? Do you know what Emersons they are?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know whether they're any Emersons,''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>retorted Freddy, who was
democratic. Like his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) sister and like most young people, he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) was naturally
attracted by the idea of equality, and the undeniable fact that there
are different kinds of Emersons annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) beyond measure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I trust they are the right sort of person. All right, Lucy'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was
sitting up again--<div class="bookquote">``I see you looking down your nose and thinking your
mother's a snob. But there is a right sort and a wrong sort, and it's
affectation to pretend there isn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Emerson's a common enough name,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>Lucy remarked.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was gazing sideways. Seated on a promontory herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could see
the pine-clad promontories descending one beyond another into the Weald.
The further one descended the garden, the more glorious was this lateral
view.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was merely going to remark, Freddy, that I trusted they were no
relations of Emerson the philosopher, a most trying man. Pray, does that
satisfy you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) grumbled. <div class="bookquote">``And you will be satisfied, too, for they're
friends of Cecil; so'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--elaborate irony--<div class="bookquote">``you and the other country
families will be able to call in perfect safety.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``CECIL?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be rude, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) mother placidly. <div class="bookquote">``Lucy, don't screech.
It's a new bad habit you're getting into.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But has Cecil--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Friends of Cecil's,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) repeated, ```and so really dee-sire-rebel. Ahem!
Honeychurch, I have just telegraphed to them.'''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) got up from the grass.

<p/>It was hard on Lucy. Mr. Beebe sympathized with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) very much. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
believed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) snub about the Miss Alans came from Sir Harry Otway,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had borne it like a good girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) might well <div class="bookquote">``screech''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) heard that it came partly from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) lover. Mr. Vyse was a
tease--something worse than a tease: he (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) took a malicious pleasure
in thwarting people. The clergyman, knowing this, looked at Miss
Honeychurch with more than his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) usual kindness.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``But Cecil's Emersons--they can't possibly be the
same ones--there is that--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) did not consider that the exclamation
was strange, but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) composure. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) diverted it as follows:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Emersons who were at Florence, do you mean? No, I don't suppose it
will prove to be them. It is probably a long cry from them to friends
of Mr. Vyse's. Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, the oddest people! The queerest
people! For our part we liked them, didn't we?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) appealed to Lucy.
<div class="bookquote">``There was a great scene over some violets. They picked violets and
filled all the vases in the room of these very Miss Alans who have
failed to come to Cissie Villa. Poor little ladies! So shocked and so
pleased. It used to be one of Miss Catharine's great stories. `My dear
sister loves flowers,' it began. They found the whole room a mass of
blue--vases and jugs--and the story ends with `So ungentlemanly and yet
so beautiful.' It is all very difficult. Yes, I always connect those
Florentine Emersons with violets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fiasco's done you this time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>remarked Freddy, not seeing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>)
sister's face was very red. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not recover herself. Mr. Beebe saw
it, and continued to divert the conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These particular Emersons consisted of a father and a son--the son
a goodly, if not a good young man; not a fool, I fancy, but very
immature--pessimism, et cetera. Our special joy was the father--such a
sentimental darling, and people declared he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had murdered his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) normal state Mr. Beebe would never have repeated such gossip,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) was trying to shelter Lucy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) little trouble. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) repeated any
rubbish that came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Murdered his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Honeychurch. <div class="bookquote">``Lucy, don't desert us--go
on playing bumble-puppy. Really, the Pension Bertolini must have been
the oddest place. That's the second murderer I've heard of as being
there. Whatever was Charlotte doing to stop? By-the-by, we really must
ask Charlotte here some time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe could recall no second murderer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) suggested that his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) hostess
was mistaken. At the hint of opposition she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) warmed. She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) was perfectly
sure that there had been a second tourist of whom the same story had
been told. The name escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>). What was the name? Oh, what was the
name? She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) knees for the name. Something in Thackeray. She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>)
struck her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) matronly forehead.

<p/>Lucy asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) brother whether Cecil was in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't go!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) cried, and tried to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) by the ankles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said gravely. <div class="bookquote">``Don't be silly. You always overdo it
when you play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) left them her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother's shout of <div class="bookquote">``Harris!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>shivered the tranquil
air, and reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had told a lie and had never put it
right. Such a senseless lie, too, yet it shattered her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) nerves and
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) connect these Emersons, friends of Cecil's, with a pair of
nondescript tourists. Hitherto truth had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) naturally. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
saw that for the future she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) must be more vigilant, and be--absolutely
truthful? Well, at all events, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) must not tell lies. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hurried up
the garden, still flushed with shame. A word from Cecil would soothe
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was sure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cecil!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) called, and leant out of the smoking-room window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>)
seemed in high spirits. <div class="bookquote">``I was hoping you'd come. I heard you all
bear-gardening, but there's better fun up here. I, even I, have won a
great victory for the Comic Muse. George Meredith's right--the cause of

found tenants for the distressful Cissie Villa. Don't be angry! Don't be
angry! You'll forgive me when you hear it all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) looked very attractive when his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) face was bright, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) dispelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
ridiculous forebodings at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Freddy has told us. Naughty Cecil! I suppose
I must forgive you. Just think of all the trouble I took for nothing!

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Friends of mine?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``But, Lucy, the whole joke is to come!

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the Umbrian Room. Absolute strangers. They were admiring Luca

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) snapped. <div class="bookquote">``You don't know what the word means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), and felt again that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had failed to be Leonardesque.
<div class="bookquote">``No, you don't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a virago</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) face was inartistic--that of a peevish virago.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't fair, Cecil. I blame you--I blame you very much indeed. You
had no business to undo my work about the Miss Alans, and make me look
ridiculous. You call it scoring off Sir Harry, but do you realize that
it is all at my expense? I consider it most disloyal of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Temper!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) thought, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) eyebrows.

<p/>No, it was worse than temper--snobbishness. As long as Lucy thought
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) own smart friends were supplanting the Miss Alans, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had
not minded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) perceived that these new tenants might be of value
educationally. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) would tolerate the father and draw out the son, who
was silent. In the interests of the Comic Muse and of Truth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Muse</b></font>) would
bring them to Windy Corner.



<p/>Chapter XI: In Mrs. Vyse's Well-Appointed Flat

<p/>The Comic Muse, though able to look after her (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) own interests, did not
disdain the assistance of Mr. Vyse. His (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) idea of bringing the Emersons to
Windy Corner struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) as decidedly good, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) carried through the
negotiations without a hitch. Sir Harry Otway signed the agreement,
met Mr. Emerson, who was duly disillusioned. The Miss Alans were
duly offended, and wrote a dignified letter to Lucy, whom they held
responsible for the failure. Mr. Beebe planned pleasant moments for the
new-comers, and told Mrs. Honeychurch that Freddy must call on them as
soon as they arrived. Indeed, so ample was the Muse's equipment that she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>)
permitted Mr. Harris, never a very robust criminal, to droop his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) head,
to be forgotten, and to die.

<p/>Lucy--to descend from bright heaven to earth, whereon there are shadows
because there are hills--Lucy was at first plunged into despair, but
settled after a little thought that it did not matter the very least.
Now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was engaged, the Emersons would scarcely insult her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) and
were welcome into the neighbourhood. And Cecil was welcome to bring whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) would into the neighbourhood. Therefore Cecil was welcome to bring
the Emersons into the neighbourhood. But, as I say, this took a little
thinking, and--so illogical are girls--the event remained rather greater
and rather more dreadful than it should have done. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was glad that
a visit to Mrs. Vyse now fell due; the tenants moved into Cissie Villa
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) was safe in the London flat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cecil--Cecil darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) whispered the evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) arrived, and crept
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) arms.

<p/>Cecil, too, became demonstrative. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) saw that the needful fire had been
kindled in Lucy. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) longed for attention, as a woman should,
and looked up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was a man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you do love me, little thing?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Cecil, I do, I do! I don't know what I should do without you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Several days passed. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had a letter from Miss Bartlett. A
coolness had sprung up between the two cousins, and they had not
corresponded since they parted in August. The coolness dated from what
Charlotte would call <div class="bookquote">``the flight to Rome,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>and in Rome it had increased
amazingly. For the companion who is merely uncongenial in the mediaeval
world becomes exasperating in the classical. Charlotte, unselfish in the
Forum, would have tried a sweeter temper than Lucy's, and once, in the
Baths of Caracalla, they had doubted whether they could continue
their tour. Lucy had said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would join the Vyses--Mrs. Vyse was an
acquaintance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) mother, so there was no impropriety in the plan and
Miss Bartlett had replied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) was quite used to being abandoned
suddenly. Finally nothing happened; but the coolness remained, and, for
Lucy, was even increased when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) opened the letter and read as follows.
It had been forwarded from Windy Corner.


<p/>``Tunbridge Wells,

<p/>``September.

<p/>``Dearest Lucia,

<p/>``I have news of you at last! Miss Lavish has been bicycling in your
parts, but was not sure whether a call would be welcome. Puncturing
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) tire near Summer Street, and it being mended while she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sat very
woebegone in that pretty churchyard, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) saw to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) astonishment, a door
open opposite and the younger Emerson man come out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) said his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) father
had just taken the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) SAID he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) did not know that you lived in the
neighbourhood -LRB-?-RRB-. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) never suggested giving Eleanor a cup of tea. Dear
Lucy, I am much worried, and I advise you to make a clean breast of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>)
past behaviour to your mother, Freddy, and Mr. Vyse, who will forbid him (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>)
to enter the house, etc.. That was a great misfortune, and I dare say you
have told them already. Mr. Vyse is so sensitive. I remember how I used
to get on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) nerves at Rome. I am very sorry about it all, and should
not feel easy unless I warned you.

<p/>``Believe me,

<p/>``Your anxious and loving cousin,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charlotte.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy was much annoyed, and replied as follows:


<p/>``Beauchamp Mansions, S.W.

<p/>``Dear Charlotte,

<p/>``Many thanks for your warning. When Mr. Emerson forgot himself on the
mountain, you made me promise not to tell mother, because you said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
would blame you for not being always with me. I have kept that promise,
and cannot possibly tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) now. I have said both to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and Cecil
that I met the Emersons at Florence, and that they are respectable
people--which I do think--and the reason that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) offered Miss Lavish no
tea was probably that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) had none himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should have tried at the
Rectory. I cannot begin making a fuss at this stage. You must see that
it would be too absurd. If the Emersons heard I had complained of them,
they would think themselves of importance, which is exactly what they
are not. I like the old father, and look forward to seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) again.
As for the son, I am sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) when we meet, rather than for myself.
They are known to Cecil, who is very well and spoke of you the other
day. We expect to be married in January.

<p/>``Miss Lavish cannot have told you much about me, for I am not at Windy
Corner at all, but here. Please do not put `Private' outside your
envelope again. No one opens my letters.

<p/>``Yours affectionately,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``L. M. Honeychurch.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Secrecy has this disadvantage: we lose the sense of proportion; we
cannot tell whether our secret is important or not. Were Lucy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
cousin closeted with a great thing which would destroy Cecil's life if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) discovered it, or with a little thing which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) would laugh at? Miss
Bartlett suggested the former. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) was right. It had become a
great thing now. Left to herself, Lucy would have told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) lover ingenuously, and it would have remained a little thing.
<div class="bookquote">``Emerson, not Harris'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>; it was only that a few weeks ago. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) tried to
tell Cecil even now when they were laughing about some beautiful
lady who had smitten his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) heart at school. But her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) body behaved so
ridiculously that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stopped.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) secret stayed ten days longer in the deserted Metropolis
visiting the scenes they were to know so well later on. It did her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) no
harm, Cecil thought, to learn the framework of society, while society
itself was absent on the golf-links or the moors. The weather was cool,
and it did her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) no harm. In spite of the season, Mrs. Vyse managed to
scrape together a dinner-party consisting entirely of the grandchildren
of famous people. The food was poor, but the talk had a witty weariness
that impressed the girl. One was tired of everything, it seemed. One
launched into enthusiasms only to collapse gracefully, and pick oneself
up amid sympathetic laughter. In this atmosphere the Pension Bertolini
and Windy Corner appeared equally crude, and Lucy saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) London
career would estrange her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) a little from all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had loved in the
past.

<p/>The grandchildren asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to play the piano.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) played Schumann. <div class="bookquote">``Now some Beethoven''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>called Cecil, when the
querulous beauty of the music had died. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) head and played
Schumann again. The melody rose, unprofitably magical. It broke; it
was resumed broken, not marching once from the cradle to the grave. The
sadness of the incomplete--the sadness that is often Life, but should
never be Art--throbbed in its disjected phrases, and made the nerves of
the audience throb. Not thus had she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) played on the little draped piano
at the Bertolini, and <div class="bookquote">``Too much Schumann''  (<font color='red'><b>Bertolini/Signora/Signora Bertolini</b></font>)</div>was not the remark that Mr.
Beebe had passed to himself when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) returned.

<p/>When the guests were gone, and Lucy had gone to bed, Mrs. Vyse paced
up and down the drawing-room, discussing her (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) little party with her (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) son.
Mrs. Vyse was a nice woman, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) personality, like many another's,
had been swamped by London, for it needs a strong head to live among
many people. The too vast orb of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) fate had crushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) had
seen too many seasons, too many cities, too many men, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) abilities,
and even with Cecil she (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) was mechanical, and behaved as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was not one
son, but, so to speak, a filial crowd.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Make Lucy one of us,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) said, looking round intelligently at the end
of each sentence, and straining her (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) lips apart until she (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) spoke again.
<div class="bookquote">``Lucy is becoming wonderful--wonderful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) music always was wonderful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) is purging off the Honeychurch taint, most excellent
Honeychurches, but you know what I mean. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) is not always quoting
servants, or asking one how the pudding is made.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Italy has done it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) murmured, thinking of the museum that represented Italy
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It is just possible. Cecil, mind you marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) next January.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) is one of us already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) music!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``The style of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)! How she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) kept to
Schumann when, like an idiot, I wanted Beethoven. Schumann was right for
this evening. Schumann was the thing. Do you know, mother, I shall have
our children educated just like Lucy. Bring them up among honest country
folks for freshness, send them to Italy for subtlety, and then--not
till then--let them come to London. I don't believe in these London
educations--''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) broke off, remembering that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) had had one himself, and
concluded, <div class="bookquote">``At all events, not for women.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Make her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) one of us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vyse</b></font>)</div>repeated Mrs. Vyse, and processed to bed.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) was dozing off, a cry--the cry of nightmare--rang from Lucy's
room. Lucy could ring for the maid if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) liked but Mrs. Vyse thought it
kind to go herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) found the girl sitting upright with her (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) hand on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) cheek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so sorry, Mrs. Vyse--it is these dreams.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bad dreams?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just dreams.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The elder lady smiled and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>), saying very distinctly: <div class="bookquote">``You
should have heard us talking about you, dear. He (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) admires you more than
ever. Dream of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy returned the kiss, still covering one cheek with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hand. Mrs.
Vyse recessed to bed. Cecil, whom the cry had not awoke, snored.
Darkness enveloped the flat.



<p/>Chapter XII: Twelfth Chapter

<p/>It was a Saturday afternoon, gay and brilliant after abundant rains, and
the spirit of youth dwelt in it, though the season was now autumn. All
that was gracious triumphed. As the motorcars passed through Summer
Street they raised only a little dust, and their stench was soon
dispersed by the wind and replaced by the scent of the wet birches or
of the pines. Mr. Beebe, at leisure for life's amenities, leant over his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>)
Rectory gate. Freddy leant by him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>), smoking a pendant pipe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose we go and hinder those new people opposite for a little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``M'm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They might amuse you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div><p/>Freddy, whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) fellow-creatures never amused, suggested that the new
people might be feeling a bit busy, and so on, since they had only just
moved in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suggested we should hinder them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Beebe. <div class="bookquote">``They are worth
it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Unlatching the gate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) sauntered over the triangular green to
Cissie Villa. <div class="bookquote">``Hullo!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) cried, shouting in at the open door, through
which much squalor was visible.

<p/>A grave voice replied, <div class="bookquote">``Hullo!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've brought someone to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be down in a minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the removal men</b></font>)</div><p/>The passage was blocked by a wardrobe, which the removal men had failed
to carry up the stairs. Mr. Beebe edged round it with difficulty. The
sitting-room itself was blocked with books.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are these people great readers?''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>Freddy whispered. <div class="bookquote">``Are they that
sort?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy they know how to read--a rare accomplishment. What have they
got? Byron. Exactly. A Shropshire Lad. Never heard of it. The Way of
All Flesh. Never heard of it. Gibbon. Hullo! dear George reads German.
Um--um--Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and so we go on. Well, I suppose your
generation knows its own business, Honeychurch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Beebe, look at that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>said Freddy in awestruck tones.

<p/>On the cornice of the wardrobe, the hand of an amateur had painted this
inscription: <div class="bookquote">``Mistrust all enterprises that require new clothes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know. Isn't it jolly? I like that. I'm certain that's the old man's
doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How very odd of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely you agree?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div><p/>But Freddy was his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) mother's son and felt that one ought not to go on
spoiling the furniture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pictures!''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>the clergyman continued, scrambling about the room.
<div class="bookquote">``Giotto--they got that at Florence, I'll be bound.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The same as Lucy's got.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, by-the-by, did Miss Honeychurch enjoy London?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) came back yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) had a good time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very,''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>said Freddy, taking up a book. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) and Cecil are thicker
than ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's good hearing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I wasn't such a fool, Mr. Beebe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe ignored the remark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy used to be nearly as stupid as I am, but it'll be very different
now, mother thinks. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will read all kinds of books.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So will you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only medical books. Not books that you can talk about afterwards. Cecil
is teaching Lucy Italian, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) says her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) playing is wonderful. There
are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed. Cecil says--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What on earth are those people doing upstairs? Emerson--we think we'll
come another time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div><p/>George ran down-stairs and pushed them into the room without speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, a neighbour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Freddy hurled one of the thunderbolts of youth. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) was shy,
perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) was friendly, or perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) thought that George's face wanted
washing. At all events he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) with, <div class="bookquote">``How d’ye do? Come and have
a bathe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>said George, impassive.

<p/>Mr. Beebe was highly entertained.

<p/>```How d’ye do? how d’ye do? Come and have a bathe,''' he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) chuckled.
<div class="bookquote">``That's the best conversational opening I've ever heard. But I'm afraid
it will only act between men. Can you picture a lady who has been
introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with `How
do you do? Come and have a bathe'? And yet you will tell me that the
sexes are equal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you that they shall be,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Emerson, who had been slowly
descending the stairs. <div class="bookquote">``Good afternoon, Mr. Beebe. I tell you they shall
be comrades, and George thinks the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are to raise ladies to our level?''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>the clergyman inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Garden of Eden,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>pursued Mr. Emerson, still descending, <div class="bookquote">``which you
place in the past, is really yet to come. We shall enter it when we no
longer despise our bodies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe disclaimed placing the Garden of Eden anywhere.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In this--not in other things--we men are ahead. We despise the body
less than women do. But not until we are comrades shall we enter the
garden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, what about this bathe?''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>murmured Freddy, appalled at the mass of
philosophy that was approaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believed in a return to Nature once. But how can we return to
Nature when we have never been with her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)? To-day, I believe that we must
discover Nature. After many conquests we shall attain simplicity. It is
our heritage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, whose sister you will remember at
Florence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do? Very glad to see you, and that you are taking George for
a bathe. Very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry. Marriage
is a duty. I am sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will be happy, for we know Mr. Vyse, too.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) has been most kind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) met us by chance in the National Gallery, and
arranged everything about this delightful house. Though I hope I have
not vexed Sir Harry Otway. I have met so few Liberal landowners, and
I was anxious to compare his (<font color='blue'><b>Otway</b></font>) attitude towards the game laws with the
Conservative attitude. Ah, this wind! You do well to bathe. Yours is a
glorious country, Honeychurch!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit!''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>mumbled Freddy. <div class="bookquote">``I must--that is to say, I have to--have
the pleasure of calling on you later on, my mother says, I hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``CALL, my lad? Who taught us that drawing-room twaddle? Call on your
grandmother! Listen to the wind among the pines! Yours is a glorious
country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe came to the rescue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Emerson, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) will call, I shall call; you or your son will return
our calls before ten days have elapsed. I trust that you have realized
about the ten days' interval. It does not count that I helped you with
the stair-eyes yesterday. It does not count that they are going to bathe
this afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, go and bathe, George. Why do you dawdle talking? Bring them back
to tea. Bring back some milk, cakes, honey. The change will do you good.
George has been working very hard at his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) office. I can't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'s
well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div><p/>George bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head, dusty and sombre, exhaling the peculiar smell of
one who has handled furniture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you really want this bathe?''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>Freddy asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It is only a pond,
don't you know. I dare say you are used to something better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--I have said `Yes' already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe felt bound to assist his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) young friend, and led the way out
of the house and into the pine-woods. How glorious it was! For a little
time the voice of old Mr. Emerson pursued them dispensing good wishes
and philosophy. It ceased, and they only heard the fair wind blowing the
bracken and the trees. Mr. Beebe, who could be silent, but who could not
bear silence, was compelled to chatter, since the expedition looked like
a failure, and neither of his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) companions would utter a word. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) spoke of
Florence. George attended gravely, assenting or dissenting with slight
but determined gestures that were as inexplicable as the motions of the
tree-tops above their heads.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what a coincidence that you should meet Mr. Vyse! Did you realize
that you would find all the Pension Bertolini down here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not. Miss Lavish told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``When I was a young man, I always meant to write a `History of
Coincidence.'''

<p/>No enthusiasm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Though, as a matter of fact, coincidences are much rarer than we
suppose. For example, it isn't purely coincidentally that you are here
now, when one comes to reflect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div><p/>To his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) relief, George began to talk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is. I have reflected. It is Fate. Everything is Fate. We are flung
together by Fate, drawn apart by Fate--flung together, drawn apart. The
twelve winds blow us--we settle nothing--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not reflected at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>rapped the clergyman. <div class="bookquote">``Let me give you
a useful tip, Emerson: attribute nothing to Fate. Don't say, `I didn't
do this,' for you did it, ten to one. Now I'll cross-question you. Where
did you first meet Miss Honeychurch and myself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Italy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And where did you meet Mr. Vyse, who is going to marry Miss
Honeychurch?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``National Gallery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Looking at Italian art. There you are, and yet you talk of coincidence
and Fate. You naturally seek out things Italian, and so do we and our
friends. This narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is Fate that I am here,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>persisted George. <div class="bookquote">``But you can call it
Italy if it makes you less unhappy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe slid away from such heavy treatment of the subject. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) was
infinitely tolerant of the young, and had no desire to snub George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so for this and for other reasons my `History of Coincidence' is
still to write.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Silence.

<p/>Wishing to round off the episode, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) added; <div class="bookquote">``We are all so glad that you
have come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here we are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>called Freddy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, good!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Beebe, mopping his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) brow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In there's the pond. I wish it was bigger,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) added apologetically.

<p/>They climbed down a slippery bank of pine-needles. There lay the pond,
set in its little alp of green--only a pond, but large enough to contain
the human body, and pure enough to reflect the sky. On account of the
rains, the waters had flooded the surrounding grass, which showed like a
beautiful emerald path, tempting these feet towards the central pool.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's distinctly successful, as ponds go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Beebe. <div class="bookquote">``No apologies
are necessary for the pond.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div><p/>George sat down where the ground was dry, and drearily unlaced his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
boots.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't those masses of willow-herb splendid? I love willow-herb in
seed. What's the name of this aromatic plant?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No one knew, or seemed to care.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These abrupt changes of vegetation--this little spongeous tract of
water plants, and on either side of it all the growths are tough or
brittle--heather, bracken, hurts, pines. Very charming, very charming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Beebe, aren't you bathing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>called Freddy, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) stripped himself.

<p/>Mr. Beebe thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) was not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Water's wonderful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>cried Freddy, prancing in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Water's water,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>murmured George. Wetting his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hair first--a sure sign of
apathy--he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) followed Freddy into the divine, as indifferent as if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) were
a statue and the pond a pail of soapsuds. It was necessary to use his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
muscles. It was necessary to keep clean. Mr. Beebe watched them, and
watched the seeds of the willow-herb dance chorically above their heads.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Apooshoo, apooshoo, apooshoo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>went Freddy, swimming for two strokes in
either direction, and then becoming involved in reeds or mud.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it worth it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked the other, Michelangelesque on the flooded
margin.

<p/>The bank broke away, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) fell into the pool before he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) had weighed the
question properly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hee-poof--I've swallowed a pollywog, Mr. Beebe, water's wonderful,
water's simply ripping.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Water's not so bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>said George, reappearing from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) plunge, and
sputtering at the sun.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Water's wonderful. Mr. Beebe, do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Apooshoo, kouf.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe, who was hot, and who always acquiesced where possible, looked
around him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) could detect no parishioners except the pine-trees,
rising up steeply on all sides, and gesturing to each other against
the blue. How glorious it was! The world of motor-cars and rural Deans
receded inimitably. Water, sky, evergreens, a wind--these things not
even the seasons can touch, and surely they lie beyond the intrusion of
man?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I may as well wash too'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; and soon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) garments made a third little pile
on the sward, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) too asserted the wonder of the water.

<p/>It was ordinary water, nor was there very much of it, and, as Freddy
said, it reminded one of swimming in a salad. The three gentlemen
rotated in the pool breast high, after the fashion of the nymphs in
Gotterdammerung. But either because the rains had given a freshness or
because the sun was shedding a most glorious heat, or because two of the
gentlemen were young in years and the third young in spirit--for some
reason or other a change came over them, and they forgot Italy and
Botany and Fate. They began to play. Mr. Beebe and Freddy splashed each
other. A little deferentially, they splashed George. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) was quiet: they
feared they had offended him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>). Then all the forces of youth burst out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>)
smiled, flung himself at them, splashed them, ducked them, kicked them,
muddied them, and drove them out of the pool.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Race you round it, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>cried Freddy, and they raced in the sunshine,
and George took a short cut and dirtied his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) shins, and had to bathe a
second time. Then Mr. Beebe consented to run--a memorable sight.

<p/>They ran to get dry, they bathed to get cool, they played at being
Indians in the willow-herbs and in the bracken, they bathed to get
clean. And all the time three little bundles lay discreetly on the
sward, proclaiming:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. We are what matters. Without us shall no enterprise begin. To us
shall all flesh turn in the end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A try! A try!''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>yelled Freddy, snatching up George's bundle and placing
it beside an imaginary goal-post.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Socker rules,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>George retorted, scattering Freddy's bundle with a kick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Goal!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Goal!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pass!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care my watch!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Beebe.

<p/>Clothes flew in all directions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care my hat! No, that's enough, Freddy. Dress now. No, I say!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/>But the two young men were delirious. Away they twinkled into the trees,
Freddy with a clerical waistcoat under his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) arm, George with a wide-awake
hat on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) dripping hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That'll do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>shouted Mr. Beebe, remembering that after all he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) was in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) own parish. Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) voice changed as if every pine-tree was a Rural
Dean. <div class="bookquote">``Hi! Steady on! I see people coming you fellows!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Yells, and widening circles over the dappled earth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hi! hi! LADIES!''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div><p/>Neither George nor Freddy was truly refined. Still, they did not hear
Mr. Beebe's last warning or they would have avoided Mrs. Honeychurch,
Cecil, and Lucy, who were walking down to call on old Mrs. Butterworth.
Freddy dropped the waistcoat at their feet, and dashed into some
bracken. George whooped in their faces, turned and scudded away down the
path to the pond, still clad in Mr. Beebe's hat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gracious alive!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Honeychurch. <div class="bookquote">``Whoever were those
unfortunate people? Oh, dears, look away! And poor Mr. Beebe, too!
Whatever has happened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come this way immediately,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>commanded Cecil, who always felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>)
must lead women, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) knew not whither, and protect them, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>)
knew not against what. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) led them now towards the bracken where Freddy
sat concealed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, poor Mr. Beebe! Was that his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) waistcoat we left in the path? Cecil,
Mr. Beebe's waistcoat--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No business of ours,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil, glancing at Lucy, who was all parasol
and evidently `minded.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy Mr. Beebe jumped back into the pond.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This way, please, Mrs. Honeychurch, this way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>They followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) up the bank attempting the tense yet nonchalant
expression that is suitable for ladies on such occasions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I can't help it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>said a voice close ahead, and Freddy reared a
freckled face and a pair of snowy shoulders out of the fronds. <div class="bookquote">``I can't
be trodden on, can I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good gracious me, dear; so it's you! What miserable management! Why not
have a comfortable bath at home, with hot and cold laid on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, mother, a fellow must wash, and a fellow's got to dry, and
if another fellow--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, no doubt you're right as usual, but you are in no position to
argue. Come, Lucy.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They turned. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, look--don't look! Oh, poor Mr.
Beebe! How unfortunate again--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>For Mr. Beebe was just crawling out of the pond, on whose surface
garments of an intimate nature did float; while George, the world-weary
George, shouted to Freddy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) had hooked a fish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And me, I've swallowed one,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>answered he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) of the bracken. <div class="bookquote">``I've
swallowed a pollywog. It wriggleth in my tummy. I shall die--Emerson you
beast, you've got on my bags.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, dears,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Honeychurch, who found it impossible to remain
shocked. <div class="bookquote">``And do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first. All these
colds come of not drying thoroughly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, do come away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``Oh for goodness' sake, do come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>cried George, so that again the ladies stopped.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) regarded himself as dressed. Barefoot, bare-chested, radiant and
personable against the shadowy woods, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) called:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo, Miss Honeychurch! Hullo!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bow, Lucy; better bow. Whoever is it? I shall bow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Honeychurch bowed.

<p/>That evening and all that night the water ran away. On the morrow the
pool had shrunk to its old size and lost its glory. It had been a
call to the blood and to the relaxed will, a passing benediction whose
influence did not pass, a holiness, a spell, a momentary chalice for
youth.



<p/>Chapter XIII: How Miss Bartlett's Boiler Was So Tiresome

<p/>How often had Lucy rehearsed this bow, this interview! But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had
always rehearsed them indoors, and with certain accessories, which
surely we have a right to assume. Who could foretell that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) and George
would meet in the rout of a civilization, amidst an army of coats
and collars and boots that lay wounded over the sunlit earth? She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had
imagined a young Mr. Emerson, who might be shy or morbid or indifferent
or furtively impudent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was prepared for all of these. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had
never imagined one who would be happy and greet her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) with the shout of
the morning star.

<p/>Indoors herself, partaking of tea with old Mrs. Butterworth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Butterworth</b></font>)
reflected that it is impossible to foretell the future with any degree
of accuracy, that it is impossible to rehearse life. A fault in the
scenery, a face in the audience, an irruption of the audience on to the
stage, and all our carefully planned gestures mean nothing, or mean too
much. <div class="bookquote">``I will bow,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Butterworth</b></font>) had thought. <div class="bookquote">``I will not shake hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>).
That will be just the proper thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Butterworth</b></font>) had bowed--but to whom? To
gods, to heroes, to the nonsense of school-girls! She (<font color='blue'><b>Butterworth</b></font>) had bowed across
the rubbish that cumbers the world.

<p/>So ran her (<font color='blue'><b>Butterworth</b></font>) thoughts, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Butterworth</b></font>) faculties were busy with Cecil. It was
another of those dreadful engagement calls. Mrs. Butterworth had wanted
to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) did not want to be seen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) did not want to hear
about hydrangeas, why they change their colour at the seaside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) did
not want to join the C. O. S. When cross he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was always elaborate, and
made long, clever answers where <div class="bookquote">``Yes''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``No''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>would have done. Lucy
soothed him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) and tinkered at the conversation in a way that promised well
for their married peace. No one is perfect, and surely it is wiser to
discover the imperfections before wedlock. Miss Bartlett, indeed, though
not in word, had taught the girl that this our life contains nothing
satisfactory. Lucy, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) disliked the teacher, regarded the
teaching as profound, and applied it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) lover.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother, when they got home, <div class="bookquote">``is anything the matter
with Cecil?''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>The question was ominous; up till now Mrs. Honeychurch had behaved with
charity and restraint.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't think so, mother; Cecil's all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>)'s tired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy compromised: perhaps Cecil was a little tired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because otherwise'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) pulled out her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) bonnet-pins with gathering
displeasure--<div class="bookquote">``because otherwise I cannot account for him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do think Mrs. Butterworth is rather tiresome, if you mean that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cecil has told you to think so. You were devoted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Butterworth</b></font>) as a little
girl, and nothing will describe her (<font color='blue'><b>Butterworth</b></font>) goodness to you through the typhoid
fever. No--it is just the same thing everywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me just put your bonnet away, may I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) could answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Butterworth</b></font>) civilly for one half-hour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cecil has a very high standard for people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>faltered Lucy, seeing
trouble ahead. <div class="bookquote">``It's part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) ideals--it is really that that makes
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) sometimes seem--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, rubbish! If high ideals make a young man rude, the sooner he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gets
rid of them the better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Honeychurch, handing her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) the bonnet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, mother! I've seen you cross with Mrs. Butterworth yourself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in that way. At times I could wring her (<font color='blue'><b>Butterworth</b></font>) neck. But not in that way.
No. It is the same with Cecil all over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By-the-by--I never told you. I had a letter from Charlotte while I was
away in London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>This attempt to divert the conversation was too puerile, and Mrs.
Honeychurch resented it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since Cecil came back from London, nothing appears to please him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>).
Whenever I speak he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) winces;--I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>), Lucy; it is useless to
contradict me. No doubt I am neither artistic nor literary nor
intellectual nor musical, but I cannot help the drawing-room furniture;
your father bought it and we must put up with it, will Cecil kindly
remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I see what you mean, and certainly Cecil oughtn't to. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) does
not mean to be uncivil--he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) once explained--it is the things that upset
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) is easily upset by ugly things--he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) is not uncivil to PEOPLE.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it a thing or a person when Freddy sings?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we
do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) leave the room? Why sit wriggling and sneering and
spoiling everyone's pleasure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We mustn't be unjust to people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>faltered Lucy. Something had enfeebled
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), and the case for Cecil, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had mastered so perfectly in
London, would not come forth in an effective form. The two civilizations
had clashed--Cecil hinted that they might--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was dazzled and
bewildered, as though the radiance that lies behind all civilization
had blinded her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) eyes. Good taste and bad taste were only catchwords,
garments of diverse cut; and music itself dissolved to a whisper through
pine-trees, where the song is not distinguishable from the comic song.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) remained in much embarrassment, while Mrs. Honeychurch changed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) frock for dinner; and every now and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) said a word, and made
things no better. There was no concealing the fact, Cecil had meant
to be supercilious, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) had succeeded. And Lucy--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knew not
why--wished that the trouble could have come at any other time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and dress, dear; you'll be late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, mother--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say `All right' and stop. Go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) obeyed, but loitered disconsolately at the landing window. It faced
north, so there was little view, and no view of the sky. Now, as in the
winter, the pine-trees hung close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) eyes. One connected the landing
window with depression. No definite problem menaced her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sighed
to herself, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, what shall I do, what shall I do?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It seemed to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) that everyone else was behaving very badly. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) ought not to
have mentioned Miss Bartlett's letter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) must be more careful; her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
mother was rather inquisitive, and might have asked what it was about.
Oh, dear, what should she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) do?--and then Freddy came bounding upstairs, and
joined the ranks of the ill-behaved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, those are topping people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear baby, how tiresome you've been! You have no business to take
them bathing in the Sacred Lake; it's much too public. It was all right for
you but most awkward for everyone else. Do be more careful. You forget
the place is growing half suburban.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, is anything on to-morrow week?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not that I know of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I want to ask the Emersons up to Sunday tennis.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I wouldn't do that, Freddy, I wouldn't do that with all this
muddle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's wrong with the court? They won't mind a bump or two, and I've
ordered new balls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I meant it's better not. I really mean it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) by the elbows and humorously danced her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) up and down the
passage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) pretended not to mind, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could have screamed with
temper. Cecil glanced at them as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) proceeded to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) toilet and they
impeded Mary with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) brood of hot-water cans. Then Mrs. Honeychurch
opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) door and said: <div class="bookquote">``Lucy, what a noise you're making! I
have something to say to you. Did you say you had had a letter from
Charlotte?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>and Freddy ran away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I really can't stop. I must dress too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How's Charlotte?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The unfortunate girl returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one's sentences.
Did Charlotte mention her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) boiler?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) WHAT?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you remember that her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) boiler was to be had out in October, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) bath cistern cleaned out, and all kinds of terrible to-doings?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't remember all Charlotte's worries,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``I shall
have enough of my own, now that you are not pleased with Cecil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Honeychurch might have flamed out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) did not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Come
here, old lady--thank you for putting away my bonnet--kiss me.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>And,
though nothing is perfect, Lucy felt for the moment that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother and
Windy Corner and the Weald in the declining sun were perfect.

<p/>So the grittiness went out of life. It generally did at Windy Corner.
At the last minute, when the social machine was clogged hopelessly, one
member or other of the family poured in a drop of oil. Cecil despised
their methods--perhaps rightly. At all events, they were not his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) own.

<p/>Dinner was at half-past seven. Freddy gabbled the grace, and they drew
up their heavy chairs and fell to. Fortunately, the men were hungry.
Nothing untoward occurred until the pudding. Then Freddy said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy, what's Emerson like?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) in Florence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, hoping that this would pass for a
reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) the clever sort, or is he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) a decent chap?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask Cecil; it is Cecil who brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) is the clever sort, like myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil.

<p/>Freddy looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) doubtfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How well did you know them at the Bertolini?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Honeychurch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very slightly. I mean, Charlotte knew them even less than I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that reminds me--you never told me what Charlotte said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One thing and another,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, wondering whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would get
through the meal without a lie. <div class="bookquote">``Among other things, that an awful
friend of hers had been bicycling through Summer Street, wondered if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'d come up and see us, and mercifully didn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy, I do call the way you talk unkind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was a novelist,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy craftily. The remark was a happy one,
for nothing roused Mrs. Honeychurch so much as literature in the hands
of females. She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) would abandon every topic to inveigh against those women
who -LRB-instead of minding their houses and their children-RRB- seek notoriety
by print. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) attitude was: <div class="bookquote">``If books must be written, let them be
written by men'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) developed it at great length, while Cecil
yawned and Freddy played at <div class="bookquote">``This year, next year, now, never,''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>with his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>)
plum-stones, and Lucy artfully fed the flames of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother's wrath. But
soon the conflagration died down, and the ghosts began to gather in the
darkness. There were too many ghosts about. The original ghost--that
touch of lips on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cheek--had surely been laid long ago; it could be
nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) that a man had kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) on a mountain once. But it
had begotten a spectral family--Mr. Harris, Miss Bartlett's letter,
Mr. Beebe's memories of violets--and one or other of these was bound to
haunt her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) before Cecil's very eyes. It was Miss Bartlett who returned
now, and with appalling vividness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been thinking, Lucy, of that letter of Charlotte's. How is she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tore the thing up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) say how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was? How does she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sound? Cheerful?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes I suppose so--no--not very cheerful, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, depend upon it, it IS the boiler. I know myself how water preys
upon one's mind. I would rather anything else--even a misfortune with
the meat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div><p/>Cecil laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So would I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>asserted Freddy, backing his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) mother up--backing up the
spirit of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) remark rather than the substance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I have been thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) added rather nervously, <div class="bookquote">``surely we could
squeeze Charlotte in here next week, and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) a nice holiday while
plumbers at Tunbridge Wells finish. I have not seen poor Charlotte for
so long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was more than her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) nerves could stand. And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not protest
violently after her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother's goodness to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) upstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pleaded. <div class="bookquote">``It's impossible. We can't have Charlotte on
the top of the other things; we're squeezed to death as it is. Freddy's
got a friend coming Tuesday, there's Cecil, and you've promised to take
in Minnie Beebe because of the diphtheria scare. It simply can't be
done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! It can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Minnie sleeps in the bath. Not otherwise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Minnie can sleep with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't have her (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, if you're so selfish, Mr. Floyd must share a room with Freddy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>moaned Cecil, again
laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's impossible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>repeated Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to make difficulties,
but it really isn't fair on the maids to fill up the house so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Alas!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The truth is, dear, you don't like Charlotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't. And no more does Cecil. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) gets on our nerves. You
haven't seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) lately, and don't realize how tiresome she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) can be,
though so good. So please, mother, don't worry us this last summer; but
spoil us by not asking her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hear, hear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil.

<p/>Mrs. Honeychurch, with more gravity than usual, and with more feeling
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) usually permitted herself, replied: <div class="bookquote">``This isn't very kind of
you two. You have each other and all these woods to walk in, so full of
beautiful things; and poor Charlotte has only the water turned off and
plumbers. You are young, dears, and however clever young people are, and
however many books they read, they will never guess what it feels like
to grow old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Cecil crumbled his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) bread.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must say Cousin Charlotte was very kind to me that year I called on
my bike,''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>put in Freddy. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) thanked me for coming till I felt like
such a fool, and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea
just right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know, dear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is kind to everyone, and yet Lucy makes this
difficulty when we try to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) some little return.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>But Lucy hardened her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) heart. It was no good being kind to Miss Bartlett.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) had tried herself too often and too recently. One might lay up
treasure in heaven by the attempt, but one enriched neither Miss
Bartlett nor any one else upon earth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) was reduced to saying: <div class="bookquote">``I
can't help it, mother. I don't like Charlotte. I admit it's horrid of
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From your own account, you told her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) as much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would leave Florence so stupidly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) flurried--''

 (<font color='red'><b>The ghosts</b></font>)</div><p/>The ghosts were returning; they filled Italy, they were even usurping
the places she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) had known as a child. The Sacred Lake would never be the
same again, and, on Sunday week, something would even happen to Windy
Corner. How would she (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) fight against ghosts? For a moment the visible
world faded away, and memories and emotions alone seemed real.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose Miss Bartlett must come, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) boils eggs so well,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil, who was in rather a happier frame of mind, thanks to the
admirable cooking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean the egg was WELL boiled,''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>corrected Freddy, <div class="bookquote">``because in
point of fact she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) forgot to take it off, and as a matter of fact I don't
care for eggs. I only meant how jolly kind she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) seemed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div><p/>Cecil frowned again. Oh, these Honeychurches! Eggs, boilers, hydrangeas,
maids--of such were their lives compact. <div class="bookquote">``May me and Lucy get down from
our chairs?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) asked, with scarcely veiled insolence. <div class="bookquote">``We don't want no
dessert.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter XIV: How Lucy Faced the External Situation Bravely

<p/>Of course Miss Bartlett accepted. And, equally of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) felt sure
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) would prove a nuisance, and begged to be given an inferior
spare room--something with no view, anything. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) love to Lucy. And,
equally of course, George Emerson could come to tennis on the Sunday
week.

<p/>Lucy faced the situation bravely, though, like most of us, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) only
faced the situation that encompassed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) never gazed inwards. If at
times strange images rose from the depths, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) put them down to nerves.
When Cecil brought the Emersons to Summer Street, it had upset her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
nerves. Charlotte would burnish up past foolishness, and this might
upset her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) nerves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was nervous at night. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) talked to
George--they met again almost immediately at the Rectory--his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) voice
moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) deeply, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wished to remain near him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). How dreadful if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
really wished to remain near him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)! Of course, the wish was due to nerves,
which love to play such perverse tricks upon us. Once she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had suffered
from <div class="bookquote">``things that came out of nothing and meant she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) didn't know what.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Now Cecil had explained psychology to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) one wet afternoon, and all the
troubles of youth in an unknown world could be dismissed.

<p/>It is obvious enough for the reader to conclude, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) loves young
Emerson.''  (<font color='red'><b>the reader</b></font>)</div>A reader in Lucy's place would not find it obvious. Life is
easy to chronicle, but bewildering to practice, and we welcome <div class="bookquote">``nerves''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>or any other shibboleth that will cloak our personal desire. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) loved
Cecil; George made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) nervous; will the reader explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) that the
phrases should have been reversed?

<p/>But the external situation--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) will face that bravely.

<p/>The meeting at the Rectory had passed off well enough. Standing between
Mr. Beebe and Cecil, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had made a few temperate allusions to Italy,
and George had replied. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was anxious to show that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was not shy,
and was glad that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did not seem shy either.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A nice fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Beebe afterwards <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) will work off his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
crudities in time. I rather mistrust young men who slip into life
gracefully.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy said, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) seems in better spirits. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) laughs more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>replied the clergyman. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is waking up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>That was all. But, as the week wore on, more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) defences fell,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) entertained an image that had physical beauty. In spite of the
clearest directions, Miss Bartlett contrived to bungle her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) arrival.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) was due at the South-Eastern station at Dorking, whither Mrs.
Honeychurch drove to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) arrived at the London and Brighton
station, and had to hire a cab up. No one was at home except Freddy
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) friend, who had to stop their tennis and to entertain her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) for
a solid hour. Cecil and Lucy turned up at four o’clock, and these, with
little Minnie Beebe, made a somewhat lugubrious sextette upon the upper
lawn for tea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never forgive myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett, who kept on rising
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) seat, and had to be begged by the united company to remain.
<div class="bookquote">``I have upset everything. Bursting in on young people! But I insist on
paying for my cab up. Grant that, at any rate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our visitors never do such dreadful things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
brother, in whose memory the boiled egg had already grown unsubstantial,
exclaimed in irritable tones: <div class="bookquote">``Just what I've been trying to convince
Cousin Charlotte of, Lucy, for the last half hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not feel myself an ordinary visitor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett, and
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) frayed glove.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, if you'd really rather. Five shillings, and I gave a bob to
the driver.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett looked in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) purse. Only sovereigns and pennies. Could
any one give her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) change? Freddy had half a quid and his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) friend had four
half-crowns. Miss Bartlett accepted their moneys and then said: <div class="bookquote">``But who
am I to give the sovereign to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's leave it all till mother comes back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>suggested Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear; your mother may take quite a long drive now that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is not
hampered with me. We all have our little foibles, and mine is the prompt
settling of accounts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Freddy's friend, Mr. Floyd, made the one remark of his (<font color='blue'><b>Floyd</b></font>) that need be
quoted: he (<font color='blue'><b>Floyd</b></font>) offered to toss Freddy for Miss Bartlett's quid. A solution
seemed in sight, and even Cecil, who had been ostentatiously drinking
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) tea at the view, felt the eternal attraction of Chance, and turned
round.

<p/>But this did not do, either.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please--please--I know I am a sad spoil-sport, but it would make me
wretched. I should practically be robbing the one who lost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Freddy owes me fifteen shillings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>interposed Cecil. <div class="bookquote">``So it will work
out right if you give the pound to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fifteen shillings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett dubiously. <div class="bookquote">``How is that, Mr.
Vyse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because, don't you see, Freddy paid your cab. Give me the pound, and we
shall avoid this deplorable gambling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett, who was poor at figures, became bewildered and rendered
up the sovereign, amidst the suppressed gurgles of the other youths. For
a moment Cecil was happy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was playing at nonsense among his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) peers.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) glanced at Lucy, in whose face petty anxieties had marred the
smiles. In January he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) would rescue his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) Leonardo from this stupefying
twaddle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't see that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Minnie/Minnie Beebe</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Minnie Beebe who had narrowly watched
the iniquitous transaction. <div class="bookquote">``I don't see why Mr. Vyse is to have the
quid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because of the fifteen shillings and the five,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they said solemnly.
<div class="bookquote">``Fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound, you see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't see--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They tried to stifle her (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) with cake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you. I'm done. I don't see why--Freddy, don't poke me. Miss
Honeychurch, your brother's hurting me. Ow! What about Mr. Floyd's
ten shillings? Ow! No, I don't see and I never shall see why Miss
What's-her-name shouldn't pay that bob for the driver.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had forgotten the driver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett, reddening. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you,
dear, for reminding me. A shilling was it? Can any one give me change
for half a crown?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll get it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the hostess</b></font>)</div>said the young hostess, rising with decision.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cecil, give me that sovereign. No, give me up that sovereign. I'll get
Euphemia to change it, and we'll start the whole thing again from the
beginning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy--Lucy--what a nuisance I am!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>protested Miss Bartlett, and
followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) across the lawn. Lucy tripped ahead, simulating hilarity.
When they were out of earshot Miss Bartlett stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) wails and said
quite briskly: <div class="bookquote">``Have you told him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) about him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I haven't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>replied Lucy, and then could have bitten her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) tongue
for understanding so quickly what her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cousin meant. <div class="bookquote">``Let me see--a
sovereign's worth of silver.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) escaped into the kitchen. Miss Bartlett's sudden transitions were
too uncanny. It sometimes seemed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) planned every word she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) spoke
or caused to be spoken; as if all this worry about cabs and change had
been a ruse to surprise the soul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I haven't told Cecil or any one,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) remarked, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) returned.
<div class="bookquote">``I promised you I shouldn't. Here is your money--all shillings, except
two half-crowns. Would you count it? You can settle your debt nicely
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett was in the drawing-room, gazing at the photograph of St.
John ascending, which had been framed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How dreadful!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``how more than dreadful, if Mr. Vyse
should come to hear of it from some other source.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, Charlotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, entering the battle. <div class="bookquote">``George Emerson
is all right, and what other source is there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett considered. <div class="bookquote">``For instance, the driver. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) looking
through the bushes at you, remember he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) had a violet between his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) teeth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy shuddered a little. <div class="bookquote">``We shall get the silly affair on our nerves
if we aren't careful. How could a Florentine cab-driver ever get hold of
Cecil?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must think of every possibility.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or perhaps old Mr. Emerson knows. In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) is certain to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care if he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) does. I was grateful to you for your letter, but
even if the news does get round, I think I can trust Cecil to laugh at
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To contradict it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, to laugh at it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knew in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) heart that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not trust
him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) desired her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) untouched.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, dear, you know best. Perhaps gentlemen are different to what
they were when I was young. Ladies are certainly different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Charlotte!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) struck at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) playfully. <div class="bookquote">``You kind, anxious thing.
What WOULD you have me do? First you say `Don't tell'; and then you say,
`Tell'. Which is it to be? Quick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett sighed <div class="bookquote">``I am no match for you in conversation, dearest. I
blush when I think how I interfered at Florence, and you so well able
to look after yourself, and so much cleverer in all ways than I am. You
will never forgive me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we go out, then. They will smash all the china if we don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Minnie/Minnie Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>For the air rang with the shrieks of Minnie, who was being scalped with
a teaspoon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, one moment--we may not have this chance for a chat again. Have
you seen the young one yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What happened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We met at the Rectory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What line is he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) taking up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No line. He (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) talked about Italy, like any other person. It is really all
right. What advantage would he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) get from being a cad, to put it bluntly?
I do wish I could make you see it my way. He (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) really won't be any
nuisance, Charlotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Once a cad, always a cad. That is my poor opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy paused. <div class="bookquote">``Cecil said one day--and I thought it so profound--that
there are two kinds of cads--the conscious and the subconscious.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
paused again, to be sure of doing justice to Cecil's profundity. Through
the window she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw Cecil himself, turning over the pages of a novel. It
was a new one from Smith's library. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother must have returned from
the station.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Once a cad, always a cad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>droned Miss Bartlett.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I mean by subconscious is that Emerson lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) head. I fell into
all those violets, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) was silly and surprised. I don't think we
ought to blame him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) very much. It makes such a difference when you see a
person with beautiful things behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) unexpectedly. It really does;
it makes an enormous difference, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) head: he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) doesn't admire
me, or any of that nonsense, one straw. Freddy rather likes him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>), and
has asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) up here on Sunday, so you can judge for yourself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) has
improved; he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) doesn't always look as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>)'s going to burst into
tears. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) is a clerk in the General Manager's office at one of the big
railways--not a porter! and runs down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) father for week-ends. Papa
was to do with journalism, but is rheumatic and has retired. There!
Now for the garden.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) took hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) guest by the arm. <div class="bookquote">``Suppose we
don't talk about this silly Italian business any more. We want you to
have a nice restful visit at Windy Corner, with no worriting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy thought this rather a good speech. The reader may have detected
an unfortunate slip in it. Whether Miss Bartlett detected the slip one
cannot say, for it is impossible to penetrate into the minds of elderly
people. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) might have spoken further, but they were interrupted by the
entrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) hostess. Explanations took place, and in the midst of
them Lucy escaped, the images throbbing a little more vividly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
brain.



<p/>Chapter XV: The Disaster Within

<p/>The Sunday after Miss Bartlett's arrival was a glorious day, like most
of the days of that year. In the Weald, autumn approached, breaking up
the green monotony of summer, touching the parks with the grey bloom of
mist, the beech-trees with russet, the oak-trees with gold. Up on the
heights, battalions of black pines witnessed the change, themselves
unchangeable. Either country was spanned by a cloudless sky, and in
either arose the tinkle of church bells.

<p/>The garden of Windy Corners was deserted except for a red book, which
lay sunning itself upon the gravel path. From the house came incoherent
sounds, as of females preparing for worship. <div class="bookquote">``The men say they won't
go'' (<font color='red'><b>Minnie/Minnie Beebe</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't blame them'' (<font color='red'><b>Minnie/Minnie Beebe</b></font>)</div>--Minnie says, <div class="bookquote">``need she (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) go?'' (<font color='red'><b>Minnie/Minnie Beebe</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Tell
her (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>), no nonsense'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Anne! Mary! Hook me behind!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Dearest Lucia, may I
trespass upon you for a pin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>For Miss Bartlett had announced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>)
at all events was one for church.

<p/>The sun rose higher on its journey, guided, not by Phaethon, but by
Apollo, competent, unswerving, divine. Its rays fell on the ladies
whenever they advanced towards the bedroom windows; on Mr. Beebe down
at Summer Street as he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) smiled over a letter from Miss Catharine Alan; on
George Emerson cleaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) father's boots; and lastly, to complete the
catalogue of memorable things, on the red book mentioned previously. The
ladies move, Mr. Beebe moves, George moves, and movement may engender
shadow. But this book lies motionless, to be caressed all the morning
by the sun and to raise its covers slightly, as though acknowledging the
caress.

<p/>Presently Lucy steps out of the drawing-room window. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) new cerise
dress has been a failure, and makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) look tawdry and wan. At her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
throat is a garnet brooch, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) finger a ring set with rubies--an
engagement ring. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) eyes are bent to the Weald. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) frowns a
little--not in anger, but as a brave child frowns when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) is trying not
to cry. In all that expanse no human eye is looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) may
frown unrebuked and measure the spaces that yet survive between Apollo
and the western hills.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy! Lucy! What's that book? Who's been taking a book out of the shelf
and leaving it about to spoil?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only the library book that Cecil's been reading.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But pick it up, and don't stand idling there like a flamingo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy picked up the book and glanced at the title listlessly, Under a
Loggia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) no longer read novels herself, devoting all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) spare time
to solid literature in the hope of catching Cecil up. It was dreadful
how little she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knew, and even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knew a thing, like
the Italian painters, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) found she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had forgotten it. Only this morning
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had confused Francesco Francia with Piero della Francesca, and Cecil
had said, <div class="bookquote">``What! you aren't forgetting your Italy already?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>And this too
had lent anxiety to her (<font color='blue'><b>Francesca</b></font>) eyes when she (<font color='blue'><b>Francesca</b></font>) saluted the dear view and the
dear garden in the foreground, and above them, scarcely conceivable
elsewhere, the dear sun.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy--have you a sixpence for Minnie and a shilling for yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Francesca</b></font>) hastened in to her (<font color='blue'><b>Francesca</b></font>) mother, who was rapidly working herself into a
Sunday fluster.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a special collection--I forget what for. I do beg, no vulgar
clinking in the plate with halfpennies; see that Minnie has a nice
bright sixpence. Where is the child? Minnie! That book's all warped.
-LRB-Gracious, how plain you look!-RRB- Put it under the Atlas to press.
Minnie!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>from the upper regions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Minnie, don't be late. Here comes the horse'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--it was always the horse,
never the carriage. <div class="bookquote">``Where's Charlotte? Run up and hurry her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). Why is she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
so long? She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had nothing to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) never brings anything but blouses.
Poor Charlotte--How I do detest blouses! Minnie!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div><p/>Paganism is infectious--more infectious than diphtheria or piety--and
the Rector's niece was taken to church protesting. As usual, she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) didn't
see why. Why shouldn't she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) sit in the sun with the young men? The
young men, who had now appeared, mocked her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) with ungenerous words. Mrs.
Honeychurch defended orthodoxy, and in the midst of the confusion Miss
Bartlett, dressed in the very height of the fashion, came strolling down
the stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Marian, I am very sorry, but I have no small change--nothing but
sovereigns and half crowns. Could any one give me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, easily. Jump in. Gracious me, how smart you look! What a lovely
frock! You put us all to shame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I did not wear my best rags and tatters now, when should I wear
them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett reproachfully. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) got into the victoria and
placed herself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) back to the horse. The necessary roar ensued,
and then they drove off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye! Be good!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>called out Cecil.

<p/>Lucy bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) lip, for the tone was sneering. On the subject of <div class="bookquote">``church
and so on''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>they had had rather an unsatisfactory conversation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) had
said that people ought to overhaul themselves, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did not want to
overhaul herself; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did not know it was done. Honest orthodoxy
Cecil respected, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) always assumed that honesty is the result of a
spiritual crisis; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) could not imagine it as a natural birthright, that
might grow heavenward like flowers. All that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) said on this subject
pained her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) exuded tolerance from every pore; somehow the
Emersons were different.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw the Emersons after church. There was a line of carriages down
the road, and the Honeychurch vehicle happened to be opposite Cissie
Villa. To save time, they walked over the green to it, and found father
and son smoking in the garden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Introduce me,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``Unless the young man considers that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
knows me already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) probably did; but Lucy ignored the Sacred Lake and introduced them
formally. Old Mr. Emerson claimed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) with much warmth, and said how
glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was going to be married. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was glad
too; and then, as Miss Bartlett and Minnie were lingering behind with
Mr. Beebe, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) turned the conversation to a less disturbing topic, and
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) new house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) replied, but there was a note of offence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) voice;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) had never known him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) offended before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``We find, though,
that the Miss Alans were coming, and that we have turned them out. Women
mind such a thing. I am very much upset about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe that there was some misunderstanding,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Honeychurch
uneasily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person,''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>said George, who seemed disposed to carry the matter further. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
thought we should be artistic. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is disappointed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I wonder whether we ought to write to the Miss Alans and offer to
give it up. What do you think?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) appealed to Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, stop now you have come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy lightly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) must avoid
censuring Cecil. For it was on Cecil that the little episode turned,
though his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) name was never mentioned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So George says. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) says that the Miss Alans must go to the wall. Yet it
does seem so unkind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is only a certain amount of kindness in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>said George,
watching the sunlight flash on the panels of the passing carriages.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Honeychurch. <div class="bookquote">``That's exactly what I say. Why all
this twiddling and twaddling over two Miss Alans?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a certain amount of kindness, just as there is a certain
amount of light,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) continued in measured tones. <div class="bookquote">``We cast a shadow
on something wherever we stand, and it is no good moving from place to
place to save things; because the shadow always follows. Choose a place
where you won't do harm--yes, choose a place where you won't do very
much harm, and stand in it for all you are worth, facing the sunshine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Emerson, I see you're clever!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see you're going to be clever. I hope you didn't go behaving like
that to poor Freddy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div><p/>George's eyes laughed, and Lucy suspected that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother would
get on rather well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I didn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) behaved that way to me. It is his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>)
philosophy. Only he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) starts life with it; and I have tried the Note of
Interrogation first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What DO you mean? No, never mind what you mean. Don't explain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) looks
forward to seeing you this afternoon. Do you play tennis? Do you mind
tennis on Sunday--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``George mind tennis on Sunday! George, after his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) education, distinguish
between Sunday--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, George doesn't mind tennis on Sunday. No more do I. That's
settled. Mr. Emerson, if you could come with your son we should be so
pleased.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), but the walk sounded rather far; he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could only potter
about in these days.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) turned to George: <div class="bookquote">``And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) wants to give up his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) house to the
Miss Alans.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>said George, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arm round his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father's neck. The
kindness that Mr. Beebe and Lucy had always known to exist in him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) came
out suddenly, like sunlight touching a vast landscape--a touch of the
morning sun? She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) remembered that in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) perversities he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) had never
spoken against affection.

<p/>Miss Bartlett approached.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know our cousin, Miss Bartlett,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Honeychurch pleasantly.
<div class="bookquote">``You met her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) with my daughter in Florence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, and made as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would come out of the
garden to meet the lady. Miss Bartlett promptly got into the victoria.
Thus entrenched, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) emitted a formal bow. It was the pension Bertolini
again, the dining-table with the decanters of water and wine. It was the
old, old battle of the room with the view.

<p/>George did not respond to the bow. Like any boy, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) blushed and was
ashamed; he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) knew that the chaperon remembered. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I--I'll come up
to tennis if I can manage it,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and went into the house. Perhaps anything
that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did would have pleased Lucy, but his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) awkwardness went straight
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) heart; men were not gods after all, but as human and as clumsy as
girls; even men might suffer from unexplained desires, and need help. To
one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) upbringing, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) destination, the weakness of men was a
truth unfamiliar, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had surmised it at Florence, when George threw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) photographs into the River Arno.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George, don't go,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father, who thought it a great treat for
people if his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) son would talk to them. <div class="bookquote">``George has been in such good
spirits today, and I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will end by coming up this afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cousin's eye. Something in its mute appeal made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
reckless. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``I do hope he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) went to the carriage and murmured, <div class="bookquote">``The old man hasn't been told;
I knew it was all right.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Honeychurch followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>), and they drove
away.

<p/>Satisfactory that Mr. Emerson had not been told of the Florence
escapade; yet Lucy's spirits should not have leapt up as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had
sighted the ramparts of heaven. Satisfactory; yet surely she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) greeted
it with disproportionate joy. All the way home the horses' hoofs sang a
tune to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has not told, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has not told.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) brain expanded the
melody: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has not told his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father--to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tells all things. It was
not an exploit. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not laugh at me when I had gone.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cheek. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not love me. No. How terrible if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did! But
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has not told. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will not tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) longed to shout the words: <div class="bookquote">``It is all right. It's a secret between
us two for ever. Cecil will never hear.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was even glad that Miss
Bartlett had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) promise secrecy, that last dark evening at
Florence, when they had knelt packing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) room. The secret, big or
little, was guarded.

<p/>Only three English people knew of it in the world. Thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) interpreted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) joy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) greeted Cecil with unusual radiance, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) felt so
safe. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) out of the carriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Emersons have been so nice. George Emerson has improved
enormously.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How are my proteges?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>asked Cecil, who took no real interest in them,
and had long since forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) resolution to bring them to Windy
Corner for educational purposes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Proteges!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) exclaimed with some warmth. For the only relationship
which Cecil conceived was feudal: that of protector and protected. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>)
had no glimpse of the comradeship after which the girl's soul yearned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall see for yourself how your proteges are. George Emerson is
coming up this afternoon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) is a most interesting man to talk to. Only
don't--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) nearly said, <div class="bookquote">``Don't protect him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>But the bell was ringing
for lunch, and, as often happened, Cecil had paid no great attention to
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) remarks. Charm, not argument, was to be her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) forte.

<p/>Lunch was a cheerful meal. Generally Lucy was depressed at meals. Some
one had to be soothed--either Cecil or Miss Bartlett or a Being not
visible to the mortal eye--a Being who whispered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) soul: <div class="bookquote">``It
will not last, this cheerfulness. In January you must go to London to
entertain the grandchildren of celebrated men.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>But to-day she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>)
had received a guarantee. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) mother would always sit there, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) brother
here. The sun, though it had moved a little since the morning, would
never be hidden behind the western hills. After luncheon they asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>)
to play. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) had seen Gluck's Armide that year, and played from memory
the music of the enchanted garden--the music to which Renaud approaches,
beneath the light of an eternal dawn, the music that never gains, never
wanes, but ripples for ever like the tideless seas of fairyland. Such
music is not for the piano, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) audience began to get restive,
and Cecil, sharing the discontent, called out: <div class="bookquote">``Now play us the other
garden--the one in Parsifal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) closed the instrument.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not very dutiful,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) mother's voice.

<p/>Fearing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) had offended Cecil, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) turned quickly round. There
George was. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had crept in without interrupting her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I had no idea!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) exclaimed, getting very red; and then, without
a word of greeting, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) reopened the piano. Cecil should have the
Parsifal, and anything else that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) liked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our performer has changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett, perhaps
implying, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) will play the music to Mr. Emerson. Lucy did not know
what to do nor even what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) wanted to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) played a few bars of the
Flower Maidens' song very badly and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I vote tennis,''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>said Freddy, disgusted at the scrappy entertainment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, so do I.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Once more she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) closed the unfortunate piano. <div class="bookquote">``I vote you
have a men's four.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for me, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil. <div class="bookquote">``I will not spoil the set.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>)
never realized that it may be an act of kindness in a bad player to make
up a fourth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, come along Cecil. I'm bad, Floyd's rotten, and so I dare say's
Emerson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div><p/>George corrected him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``I am not bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>One looked down one's nose at this. <div class="bookquote">``Then certainly I won't play,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said
Cecil, while Miss Bartlett, under the impression that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) was snubbing
George, added: <div class="bookquote">``I agree with you, Mr. Vyse. You had much better not
play. Much better not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div><p/>Minnie, rushing in where Cecil feared to tread, announced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>) would
play. <div class="bookquote">``I shall miss every ball anyway, so what does it matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But
Sunday intervened and stamped heavily upon the kindly suggestion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it will have to be Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Honeychurch; <div class="bookquote">``you must fall
back on Lucy. There is no other way out of it. Lucy, go and change your
frock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy's Sabbath was generally of this amphibious nature. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) kept it
without hypocrisy in the morning, and broke it without reluctance in
the afternoon. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) frock, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) wondered whether Cecil was
sneering at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>); really she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) must overhaul herself and settle everything
up before she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) married him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>).

<p/>Mr. Floyd was her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) partner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) liked music, but how much better tennis
seemed. How much better to run about in comfortable clothes than to sit
at the piano and feel girt under the arms. Once more music appeared to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) the employment of a child. George served, and surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
anxiety to win. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) remembered how he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had sighed among the tombs at
Santa Croce because things wouldn't fit; how after the death of that
obscure Italian he (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) had leant over the parapet by the Arno and said to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``I shall want to live, I tell you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Arno</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arno</b></font>) wanted to live now, to win
at tennis, to stand for all he (<font color='blue'><b>Arno</b></font>) was worth in the sun--the sun which had
begun to decline and was shining in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) eyes; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arno</b></font>) did win.

<p/>Ah, how beautiful the Weald looked! The hills stood out above its
radiance, as Fiesole stands above the Tuscan Plain, and the South Downs,
if one chose, were the mountains of Carrara. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) might be forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
Italy, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was noticing more things in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) England. One could play
a new game with the view, and try to find in its innumerable folds some
town or village that would do for Florence. Ah, how beautiful the Weald
looked!

<p/>But now Cecil claimed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) chanced to be in a lucid critical mood,
and would not sympathize with exaltation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) had been rather a nuisance
all through the tennis, for the novel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was reading was so bad
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was obliged to read it aloud to others. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) would stroll round
the precincts of the court and call out: <div class="bookquote">``I say, listen to this, Lucy.
Three split infinitives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dreadful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, and missed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) stroke. When they had finished
their set, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) still went on reading; there was some murder scene, and
really everyone must listen to it. Freddy and Mr. Floyd were obliged to
hunt for a lost ball in the laurels, but the other two acquiesced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The scene is laid in Florence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What fun, Cecil! Read away. Come, Mr. Emerson, sit down after all your
energy.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``forgiven''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>George, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) put it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) made a point
of being pleasant to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) jumped over the net and sat down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) feet asking: <div class="bookquote">``You--and are
you tired?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I'm not!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mind being beaten?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was going to answer, <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>when it struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did mind,
so she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) added merrily, <div class="bookquote">``I don't see you're such
a splendid player, though. The light was behind you, and it was in my
eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never said I was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you did!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't attend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You said--oh, don't go in for accuracy at this house. We all
exaggerate, and we get very angry with people who don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div><p/>```The scene is laid in Florence,''' repeated Cecil, with an upward note.

<p/>Lucy recollected herself.

<p/>```Sunset. Leonora was speeding--'''

<p/>Lucy interrupted. <div class="bookquote">``Leonora? Is Leonora the heroine? Who's the book by?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Joseph Emery Prank. `Sunset. Leonora speeding across the square. Pray
the saints she (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) might not arrive too late. Sunset--the sunset of Italy.
Under Orcagna's Loggia--the Loggia de' Lanzi, as we sometimes call it
now--'''

<p/>Lucy burst into laughter. ```Joseph Emery Prank' indeed! Why it's Miss
Lavish! It's Miss Lavish's novel, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)'s publishing it under somebody
else's name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who may Miss Lavish be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, a dreadful person--Mr. Emerson, you remember Miss Lavish?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Excited by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) pleasant afternoon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hands.

<p/>George looked up. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I do. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) the day I arrived at Summer
Street. It was she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) who told me that you lived here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Weren't you pleased?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) meant <div class="bookquote">``to see Miss Lavish,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>but when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) bent
down to the grass without replying, it struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could mean
something else. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) watched his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head, which was almost resting against
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knee, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thought that the ears were reddening. <div class="bookquote">``No wonder the
novel's bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) added. <div class="bookquote">``I never liked Miss Lavish. But I suppose one
ought to read it as one's met her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All modern books are bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil, who was annoyed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
inattention, and vented his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) annoyance on literature. <div class="bookquote">``Every one writes
for money in these days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Cecil--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so. I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div><p/>Cecil, this afternoon seemed such a twittering sparrow. The ups and
downs in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) voice were noticeable, but they did not affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had
dwelt amongst melody and movement, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) nerves refused to answer to
the clang of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>). Leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) to be annoyed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) gazed at the black head
again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did not want to stroke it, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw herself wanting to
stroke it; the sensation was curious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you like this view of ours, Mr. Emerson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never notice much difference in views.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because they're all alike. Because all that matters in them is distance
and air.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil, uncertain whether the remark was striking or not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My father'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) -LRB-and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was a little flushed-RRB---<div class="bookquote">``says
that there is only one perfect view--the view of the sky straight over
our heads, and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I expect your father has been reading Dante,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil, fingering the
novel, which alone permitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) to lead the conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) told us another day that views are really crowds--crowds of trees
and houses and hills--and are bound to resemble each other, like human
crowds--and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural,
for the same reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy's lips parted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For a crowd is more than the people who make it up. Something gets
added to it--no one knows how--just as something has got added to those
hills.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) pointed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) racquet to the South Downs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a splendid idea!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``I shall enjoy hearing your father
talk again. I'm so sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s not so well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) isn't well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's an absurd account of a view in this book,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil. <div class="bookquote">``Also
that men fall into two classes--those who forget views and those who
remember them, even in small rooms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Emerson, have you any brothers or sisters?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None. Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``You spoke of `us.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother, I was meaning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div><p/>Cecil closed the novel with a bang.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Cecil--how you made me jump!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and
seeing as far as Hindhead. It is the first thing that I remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div><p/>Cecil got up; the man was ill-bred--he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) hadn't put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) coat after
tennis--he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) didn't do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) would have strolled away if Lucy had not
stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cecil, do read the thing about the view.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not while Mr. Emerson is here to entertain us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--read away. I think nothing's funnier than to hear silly things read
out loud. If Mr. Emerson thinks us frivolous, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) can go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div><p/>This struck Cecil as subtle, and pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>). It put their visitor in
the position of a prig. Somewhat mollified, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) sat down again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Emerson, go and find tennis balls.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) opened the book. Cecil
must have his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) reading and anything else that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) liked. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) attention
wandered to George's mother, who--according to Mr. Eager--had been
murdered in the sight of God and--according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) son--had seen as far as
Hindhead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I really to go?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>asked George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, of course not really,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Chapter two,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil, yawning. <div class="bookquote">``Find me chapter two, if it isn't
bothering you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter two was found, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) glanced at its opening sentences.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had gone mad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here--hand me the book.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) voice saying: <div class="bookquote">``It isn't worth reading--it's too silly
to read--I never saw such rubbish--it oughtn't to be allowed to be
printed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) took the book from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).

<p/>```Leonora,''' he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) read, ```sat pensive and alone. Before her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) lay the rich
champaign of Tuscany, dotted over with many a smiling village. The
season was spring.'''

<p/>Miss Lavish knew, somehow, and had printed the past in draggled prose,
for Cecil to read and for George to hear.

<p/>```A golden haze,''' he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) read. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) read: ```Afar off the towers of Florence,
while the bank on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) sat was carpeted with violets. All
unobserved Antonio stole up behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>)--'''

<p/>Lest Cecil should see her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) face she (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) turned to George and saw his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) face.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) read: ```There came from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lips no wordy protestation such as formal
lovers use. No eloquence was his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) suffer from the lack of it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) simply enfolded her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) manly arms.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This isn't the passage I wanted,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) informed them, <div class="bookquote">``there is another
much funnier, further on.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) turned over the leaves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Should we go in to tea?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, whose voice remained steady.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) led the way up the garden, Cecil following her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), George last. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
thought a disaster was averted. But when they entered the shrubbery
it came. The book, as if it had not worked mischief enough, had
been forgotten, and Cecil must go back for it; and George, who loved
passionately, must blunder against her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) in the narrow path.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) gasped, and, for the second time, was kissed by him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/>As if no more was possible, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) slipped back; Cecil rejoined her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>); they
reached the upper lawn alone.



<p/>Chapter XVI: Lying to George

<p/>But Lucy had developed since the spring. That is to say, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was now
better able to stifle the emotions of which the conventions and the
world disapprove. Though the danger was greater, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was not shaken by
deep sobs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said to Cecil, <div class="bookquote">``I am not coming in to tea--tell mother--I
must write some letters,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>and went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) room. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) prepared
for action. Love felt and returned, love which our bodies exact and
our hearts have transfigured, love which is the most real thing that
we shall ever meet, reappeared now as the world's enemy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) must
stifle it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sent for Miss Bartlett.

<p/>The contest lay not between love and duty. Perhaps there never is such a
contest. It lay between the real and the pretended, and Lucy's first aim
was to defeat herself. As her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) brain clouded over, as the memory of the
views grew dim and the words of the book died away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
old shibboleth of nerves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``conquered her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) breakdown.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Tampering with
the truth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) forgot that the truth had ever been. Remembering that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
was engaged to Cecil, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) compelled herself to confused remembrances
of George; he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) never had been anything; he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
had behaved abominably; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had never encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). The armour of
falsehood is subtly wrought out of darkness, and hides a man not only
from others, but from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own soul. In a few moments Lucy was equipped
for battle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something too awful has happened,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) began, as soon as her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cousin
arrived. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know anything about Miss Lavish's novel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett looked surprised, and said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) had not read the book,
nor known that it was published; Eleanor was a reticent woman at heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a scene in it. The hero and heroine make love. Do you know
about that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know about it, please?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``They are on a hillside,
and Florence is in the distance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My good Lucia, I am all at sea. I know nothing about it whatever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are violets. I cannot believe it is a coincidence. Charlotte,
Charlotte, how could you have told her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)? I have thought before speaking;
it must be you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Told her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) what?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) asked, with growing agitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About that dreadful afternoon in February.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett was genuinely moved. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Lucy, dearest girl--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hasn't
put that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) book?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so that one could recognize it. Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then never--never--never more shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of
mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you did tell?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did just happen--when I had tea with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavish</b></font>) at Rome--in the course of
conversation--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Charlotte--what about the promise you gave me when we were packing?
Why did you tell Miss Lavish, when you wouldn't even let me tell
mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will never forgive Eleanor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) has betrayed my confidence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), though? This is a most serious thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Why does any one tell anything? The question is eternal, and it was not
surprising that Miss Bartlett should only sigh faintly in response. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>)
had done wrong--she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) admitted it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) only hoped that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) had not done
harm; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) had told Eleanor in the strictest confidence.

<p/>Lucy stamped with irritation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to Mr. Emerson;
it upset Mr. Emerson and he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) insulted me again. Behind Cecil's back. Ugh!
Is it possible that men are such brutes? Behind Cecil's back as we were
walking up the garden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett burst into self-accusations and regrets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is to be done now? Can you tell me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Lucy--I shall never forgive myself, never to my dying day. Fancy if
your prospects--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, wincing at the word. <div class="bookquote">``I see now why you wanted me
to tell Cecil, and what you meant by `some other source.' You knew that
you had told Miss Lavish, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was not reliable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>It was Miss Bartlett's turn to wince. <div class="bookquote">``However,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl,
despising her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cousin's shiftiness, <div class="bookquote">``What's done's done. You have put me
in a most awkward position. How am I to get out of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett could not think. The days of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) energy were over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) was
a visitor, not a chaperon, and a discredited visitor at that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) stood
with clasped hands while the girl worked herself into the necessary
rage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) must--that man must have such a setting down that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) won't forget.
And who's to give it him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>)? I can't tell mother now--owing to you. Nor
Cecil, Charlotte, owing to you. I am caught up every way. I think I
shall go mad. I have no one to help me. That's why I've sent for you.
What's wanted is a man with a whip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett agreed: one wanted a man with a whip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--but it's no good agreeing. What's to be DONE. We women go
maundering on. What DOES a girl do when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) comes across a cad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I always said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a cad, dear. Give me credit for that, at all
events. From the very first moment--when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father was having a
bath.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, bother the credit and who's been right or wrong! We've both made a
muddle of it. George Emerson is still down the garden there, and is he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>)
to be left unpunished, or isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>)? I want to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett was absolutely helpless. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) own exposure had unnerved
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>), and thoughts were colliding painfully in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) brain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) moved
feebly to the window, and tried to detect the cad's white flannels among
the laurels.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were ready enough at the Bertolini when you rushed me off to Rome.
Can't you speak again to him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Willingly would I move heaven and earth--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want something more definite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy contemptuously. <div class="bookquote">``Will you
speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>)? It is the least you can do, surely, considering it all
happened because you broke your word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never again shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Really, Charlotte was outdoing herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes or no, please; yes or no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle.''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>George
Emerson was coming up the garden with a tennis ball in his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, with an angry gesture. <div class="bookquote">``No one will help me. I
will speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And immediately she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) realized that this was
what her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cousin had intended all along.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo, Emerson!''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>called Freddy from below. <div class="bookquote">``Found the lost ball? Good
man! Want any tea?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And there was an irruption from the house on to the
terrace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Lucy, but that is brave of you! I admire you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div><p/>They had gathered round George, who beckoned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) felt, over the
rubbish, the sloppy thoughts, the furtive yearnings that were beginning
to cumber her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) soul. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) anger faded at the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). Ah! The
Emersons were fine people in their way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had to subdue a rush in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
blood before saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Freddy has taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) into the dining-room. The others are going down
the garden. Come. Let us get this over quickly. Come. I want you in the
room, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy, do you mind doing it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you ask such a ridiculous question?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Lucy--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``I seem to bring nothing
but misfortune wherever I go.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>Lucy nodded. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) remembered their
last evening at Florence--the packing, the candle, the shadow of Miss
Bartlett's toque on the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) was not to be trapped by pathos a
second time. Eluding her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) cousin's caress, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) led the way downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Try the jam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>Freddy was saying. <div class="bookquote">``The jam's jolly good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div><p/>George, looking big and dishevelled, was pacing up and down the
dining-room. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) entered he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) stopped, and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--nothing to eat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You go down to the others,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy; <div class="bookquote">``Charlotte and I will give Mr.
Emerson all he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) wants. Where's mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s started on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) Sunday writing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s in the drawing-room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all right. You go away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) went off singing.

<p/>Lucy sat down at the table. Miss Bartlett, who was thoroughly
frightened, took up a book and pretended to read.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would not be drawn into an elaborate speech. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) just said: <div class="bookquote">``I can't
have it, Mr. Emerson. I cannot even talk to you. Go out of this house,
and never come into it again as long as I live here--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>flushing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
spoke and pointing to the door. <div class="bookquote">``I hate a row. Go please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No discussion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I can't--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Go, please. I do not want to call in Mr. Vyse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) said, absolutely ignoring Miss Bartlett--<div class="bookquote">``you don't
mean that you are going to marry that man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>The line was unexpected.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) shoulders, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) vulgarity wearied her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You are
merely ridiculous,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) said quietly.

<p/>Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) words rose gravely over hers: <div class="bookquote">``You cannot live with Vyse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>)'s
only for an acquaintance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) is for society and cultivated talk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>)
should know no one intimately, least of all a woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a new light on Cecil's character.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you ever talked to Vyse without feeling tired?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can scarcely discuss--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but have you ever? He (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) is the sort who are all right so long as
they keep to things--books, pictures--but kill when they come to
people. That's why I'll speak out through all this muddle even now. It's
shocking enough to lose you in any case, but generally a man must
deny himself joy, and I would have held back if your Cecil had been a
different person. I would never have let myself go. But I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) first
in the National Gallery, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) winced because my father mispronounced
the names of great painters. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) brings us here, and we find it
is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour. That is the man all
over--playing tricks on people, on the most sacred form of life that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can find. Next, I meet you together, and find him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) protecting and
teaching you and your mother to be shocked, when it was for YOU to
settle whether you were shocked or no. Cecil all over again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) daren't
let a woman decide. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>)'s the type who's kept Europe back for a thousand
years. Every moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>)'s forming you, telling you what's
charming or amusing or ladylike, telling you what a man thinks womanly;
and you, you of all women, listen to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice instead of to your own.
So it was at the Rectory, when I met you both again; so it has been
the whole of this afternoon. Therefore--not `therefore I kissed you,'
because the book made me do that, and I wish to goodness I had more
self-control. I'm not ashamed. I don't apologize. But it has frightened
you, and you may not have noticed that I love you. Or would you have
told me to go, and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly? But
therefore--therefore I settled to fight him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy thought of a very good remark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You say Mr. Vyse wants me to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>), Mr. Emerson. Pardon me for
suggesting that you have caught the habit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) took the shoddy reproof and touched it into immortality. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and sank down as if suddenly weary. <div class="bookquote">``I'm the same kind of
brute at bottom. This desire to govern a woman--it lies very deep, and
men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden.
But I do love you surely in a better way than he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) does.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) thought.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes--really in a better way. I want you to have your own thoughts even
when I hold you in my arms.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) stretched them towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Lucy, be
quick--there's no time for us to talk now--come to me as you came in the
spring, and afterwards I will be gentle and explain. I have cared
for you since that man died. I cannot live without you, `No good,' I
thought; `she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) is marrying someone else'; but I meet you again when all
the world is glorious water and sun. As you came through the wood I
saw that nothing else mattered. I called. I wanted to live and have my
chance of joy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Mr. Vyse?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, who kept commendably calm. <div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) not
matter? That I love Cecil and shall be his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) wife shortly? A detail of no
importance, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) arms over the table towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``It is our last chance. I shall do all that I can.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>And as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) had done all else, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) turned to Miss Bartlett, who sat like some
portent against the skies of the evening. <div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't stop us this
second time if you understood,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I have been into the dark, and
I am going back into it, unless you will try to understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) long, narrow head drove backwards and forwards, as though
demolishing some invisible obstacle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) did not answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is being young,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) said quietly, picking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) racquet from the
floor and preparing to go. <div class="bookquote">``It is being certain that Lucy cares for me
really. It is that love and youth matter intellectually.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div><p/>In silence the two women watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) last remark, they knew, was
nonsense, but was he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) going after it or not? Would not he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>), the cad,
the charlatan, attempt a more dramatic finish? No. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was apparently
content. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) left them, carefully closing the front door; and when they
looked through the hall window, they saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) go up the drive and begin
to climb the slopes of withered fern behind the house. Their tongues
were loosed, and they burst into stealthy rejoicings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Lucia--come back here--oh, what an awful man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy had no reaction--at least, not yet. <div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) amuses me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``Either I'm mad, or else he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is, and I'm inclined to think it's the
latter. One more fuss through with you, Charlotte. Many thanks. I think,
though, that this is the last. My admirer will hardly trouble me again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>And Miss Bartlett, too, essayed the roguish:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it isn't everyone who could boast such a conquest, dearest, is
it? Oh, one oughtn't to laugh, really. It might have been very serious.
But you were so sensible and brave--so unlike the girls of my day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's go down to them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But, once in the open air, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) paused. Some emotion--pity, terror, love,
but the emotion was strong--seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) was aware of autumn.
Summer was ending, and the evening brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) odours of decay, the
more pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring. That something or
other mattered intellectually? A leaf, violently agitated, danced past
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>), while other leaves lay motionless. That the earth was hastening to
re-enter darkness, and the shadows of those trees over Windy Corner?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo, Lucy! There's still light enough for another set, if you two'll
hurry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Emerson has had to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a nuisance! That spoils the four. I say, Cecil, do play, do,
there's a good chap. It's Floyd's last day. Do play tennis with us, just
this once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div><p/>Cecil's voice came: <div class="bookquote">``My dear Freddy, I am no athlete. As you well
remarked this very morning, `There are some chaps who are no good for
anything but books'; I plead guilty to being such a chap, and will not
inflict myself on you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div><p/>The scales fell from Lucy's eyes. How had she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) stood Cecil for a moment?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was absolutely intolerable, and the same evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) broke off her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
engagement.



<p/>Chapter XVII: Lying to Cecil

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was bewildered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) had nothing to say. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was not even angry, but
stood, with a glass of whiskey between his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) hands, trying to think what
had led her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to such a conclusion.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had chosen the moment before bed, when, in accordance with their
bourgeois habit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) always dispensed drinks to the men. Freddy and Mr.
Floyd were sure to retire with their glasses, while Cecil invariably
lingered, sipping at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) locked up the sideboard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I have carefully thought things
over. We are too different. I must ask you to release me, and try to
forget that there ever was such a foolish girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a suitable speech, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was more angry than sorry, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
voice showed it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Different--how--how--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't had a really good education, for one thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) continued,
still on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knees by the sideboard. <div class="bookquote">``My Italian trip came too late, and
I am forgetting all that I learnt there. I shall never be able to talk
to your friends, or behave as a wife of yours should.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand you. You aren't like yourself. You're tired, Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tired!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) retorted, kindling at once. <div class="bookquote">``That is exactly like you. You
always think women don't mean what they say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you sound tired, as if something has worried you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What if I do? It doesn't prevent me from realizing the truth. I can't
marry you, and you will thank me for saying so some day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had that bad headache yesterday--All right'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had exclaimed
indignantly: <div class="bookquote">``I see it's much more than headaches. But give me a
moment's time.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``You must excuse me if I say stupid
things, but my brain has gone to pieces. Part of it lives three minutes
back, when I was sure that you loved me, and the other part--I find it
difficult--I am likely to say the wrong thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was not behaving so badly, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) irritation
increased. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) again desired a struggle, not a discussion. To bring on
the crisis, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are days when one sees clearly, and this is one of them. Things
must come to a breaking-point some time, and it happens to be to-day. If
you want to know, quite a little thing decided me to speak to you--when
you wouldn't play tennis with Freddy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never do play tennis,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil, painfully bewildered; <div class="bookquote">``I never
could play. I don't understand a word you say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can play well enough to make up a four. I thought it abominably
selfish of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I can't--well, never mind the tennis. Why couldn't you--couldn't
you have warned me if you felt anything wrong? You talked of our wedding
at lunch--at least, you let me talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew you wouldn't understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy quite crossly. <div class="bookquote">``I might have
known there would have been these dreadful explanations. Of course,
it isn't the tennis--that was only the last straw to all I have been
feeling for weeks. Surely it was better not to speak until I felt
certain.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) developed this position. <div class="bookquote">``Often before I have wondered if
I was fitted for your wife--for instance, in London; and are you fitted
to be my husband? I don't think so. You don't like Freddy, nor my
mother. There was always a lot against our engagement, Cecil, but all
our relations seemed pleased, and we met so often, and it was no good
mentioning it until--well, until all things came to a point. They have
to-day. I see clearly. I must speak. That's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot think you were right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil gently. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell
why, but though all that you say sounds true, I feel that you are not
treating me fairly. It's all too horrible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the good of a scene?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No good. But surely I have a right to hear a little more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) glass and opened the window. From where she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knelt,
jangling her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) keys, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could see a slit of darkness, and, peering into
it, as if it would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) that <div class="bookquote">``little more,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) long, thoughtful
face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't open the window; and you'd better draw the curtain, too; Freddy
or any one might be outside.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) obeyed. <div class="bookquote">``I really think we had better
go to bed, if you don't mind. I shall only say things that will make me
unhappy afterwards. As you say it is all too horrible, and it is no good
talking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div><p/>But to Cecil, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was about to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) seemed each moment
more desirable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), instead of through her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), for the first
time since they were engaged. From a Leonardo she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had become a living
woman, with mysteries and forces of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own, with qualities that even
eluded art. His (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) brain recovered from the shock, and, in a burst of
genuine devotion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) cried: <div class="bookquote">``But I love you, and I did think you loved
me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I thought I did at first. I am sorry, and ought
to have refused you this last time, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) began to walk up and down the room, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) grew more and more vexed
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) dignified behaviour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had counted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) being petty. It would
have made things easier for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). By a cruel irony she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was drawing out
all that was finest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) disposition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't love me, evidently. I dare say you are right not to. But it
would hurt a little less if I knew why.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>--a phrase came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) accepted it--<div class="bookquote">``you're the sort
who can't know any one intimately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>A horrified look came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean exactly that. But you will question me, though I beg you
not to, and I must say something. It is that, more or less. When we
were only acquaintances, you let me be myself, but now you're always
protecting me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) voice swelled. <div class="bookquote">``I won't be protected. I will choose
for myself what is ladylike and right. To shield me is an insult. Can't
I be trusted to face the truth but I must get it second-hand through
you? A woman's place! You despise my mother--I know you do--because
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s conventional and bothers over puddings; but, oh goodness!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) feet--<div class="bookquote">``conventional, Cecil, you're that, for you may
understand beautiful things, but you don't know how to use them; and you
wrap yourself up in art and books and music, and would try to wrap up
me. I won't be stifled, not by the most glorious music, for people are
more glorious, and you hide them from me. That's why I break off my
engagement. You were all right as long as you kept to things, but when
you came to people--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) stopped.

<p/>There was a pause. Then Cecil said with great emotion:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True on the whole,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) corrected, full of some vague shame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``True, every word. It is a revelation. It is--I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anyhow, those are my reasons for not being your wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) repeated: ```The sort that can know no one intimately.' It is true. I
fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged. I behaved like a cad
to Beebe and to your brother. You are even greater than I thought.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
withdrew a step. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to worry you. You are far too good to
me. I shall never forget your insight; and, dear, I only blame you for
this: you might have warned me in the early stages, before you felt
you wouldn't marry me, and so have given me a chance to improve. I have
never known you till this evening. I have just used you as a peg for
my silly notions of what a woman should be. But this evening you are a
different person: new thoughts--even a new voice--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by a new voice?''  (<font color='red'><b>a person</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) asked, seized with incontrollable
anger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean that a new person seems speaking through you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>).

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) balance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cried: <div class="bookquote">``If you think I am in love with
someone else, you are very much mistaken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I don't think that. You are not that kind, Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, you do think it. It's your old idea, the idea that has kept
Europe back--I mean the idea that women are always thinking of men. If
a girl breaks off her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) engagement, everyone says: `Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had some
one else in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hopes to get someone else.' It's disgusting,
brutal! As if a girl can't break it off for the sake of freedom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) answered reverently: <div class="bookquote">``I may have said that in the past. I shall never
say it again. You have taught me better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) began to redden, and pretended to examine the windows again. <div class="bookquote">``Of
course, there is no question of `someone else' in this, no `jilting' or
any such nauseous stupidity. I beg your pardon most humbly if my words
suggested that there was. I only meant that there was a force in you
that I hadn't known of up till now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, Cecil, that will do. Don't apologize to me. It was my
mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a question between ideals, yours and mine--pure abstract ideals,
and yours are the nobler. I was bound up in the old vicious notions,
and all the time you were splendid and new.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) voice broke. <div class="bookquote">``I must
actually thank you for what you have done--for showing me what I really
am. Solemnly, I thank you for showing me a true woman. Will you shake
hands?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, twisting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) other hand in the
curtains. <div class="bookquote">``Good-night, Cecil. Good-bye. That's all right. I'm sorry
about it. Thank you very much for your gentleness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me light your candle, shall I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They went into the hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. Good-night again. God bless you, Lucy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Cecil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) steal up-stairs, while the shadows from three banisters
passed over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) face like the beat of wings. On the landing he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) paused
strong in his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) renunciation, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) a look of memorable beauty. For
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) culture, Cecil was an ascetic at heart, and nothing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) love
became him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) like the leaving of it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could never marry. In the tumult of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) soul, that stood firm. Cecil
believed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) must some day believe in herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) must be one
of the women whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had praised so eloquently, who care for liberty
and not for men; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) must forget that George loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), that George had
been thinking through her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) and gained her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) this honourable release, that
George had gone away into--what was it?--the darkness.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) put out the lamp.

<p/>It did not do to think, nor, for the matter of that, to feel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) gave up
trying to understand herself, and joined the vast armies of the benighted, who
follow neither the heart nor the brain, and march to their destiny by
catch-words. The armies are full of pleasant and pious folk. But they
have yielded to the only enemy that matters--the enemy within. They have
sinned against passion and truth, and vain will be their strife after
virtue. As the years pass, they are censured. Their pleasantry and
their piety show cracks, their wit becomes cynicism, their unselfishness
hypocrisy; they feel and produce discomfort wherever they go. They have
sinned against Eros and against Pallas Athene, and not by any heavenly
intervention, but by the ordinary course of nature, those allied deities
will be avenged.

<p/>Lucy entered this army when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) pretended to George that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did not
love him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and pretended to Cecil that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) loved no one. The night
received her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), as it had received Miss Bartlett thirty years before.



<p/>Chapter XVIII: Lying to Mr. Beebe, Mrs. Honeychurch, Freddy, and The
Servants

<p/>Windy Corner lay, not on the summit of the ridge, but a few hundred feet
down the southern slope, at the springing of one of the great buttresses
that supported the hill. On either side of it was a shallow ravine,
filled with ferns and pine-trees, and down the ravine on the left ran
the highway into the Weald.

<p/>Whenever Mr. Beebe crossed the ridge and caught sight of these noble
dispositions of the earth, and, poised in the middle of them, Windy
Corner,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) laughed. The situation was so glorious, the house so
commonplace, not to say impertinent. The late Mr. Honeychurch had
affected the cube, because it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) the most accommodation for his (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>)
money, and the only addition made by his (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) widow had been a small turret,
shaped like a rhinoceros' horn, where she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) could sit in wet weather and
watch the carts going up and down the road. So impertinent--and yet the
house <div class="bookquote">``did,''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>for it was the home of people who loved their surroundings
honestly. Other houses in the neighborhood had been built by expensive
architects, over others their inmates had fidgeted sedulously, yet all
these suggested the accidental, the temporary; while Windy Corner seemed
as inevitable as an ugliness of Nature's own creation. One might laugh
at the house, but one never shuddered. Mr. Beebe was bicycling over
this Monday afternoon with a piece of gossip. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) had heard from the Miss
Alans. These admirable ladies, since they could not go to Cissie Villa,
had changed their plans. They were going to Greece instead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since Florence did my poor sister so much good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Alan/Miss Catharine Alan/Miss Catharine</b></font>)</div>wrote Miss Catharine,
<div class="bookquote">``we do not see why we should not try Athens this winter. Of course,
Athens is a plunge, and the doctor has ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) special digestive
bread; but, after all, we can take that with us, and it is only getting
first into a steamer and then into a train. But is there an English
Church?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Alan/Miss Catharine Alan/Miss Catharine</b></font>)</div>And the letter went on to say: <div class="bookquote">``I do not expect we shall go any
further than Athens, but if you knew of a really comfortable pension at
Constantinople, we should be so grateful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy would enjoy this letter, and the smile with which Mr. Beebe greeted
Windy Corner was partly for her (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) would see the fun of it, and some
of its beauty, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) must see some beauty. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) was hopeless
about pictures, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) dressed so unevenly--oh, that cerise
frock yesterday at church!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) must see some beauty in life, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>)
could not play the piano as she (<font color='blue'><b>Windy</b></font>) did. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) had a theory that musicians are
incredibly complex, and know far less than other artists what they want
and what they are; that they puzzle themselves as well as their friends;
that their psychology is a modern development, and has not yet been
understood. This theory, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) known it, had possibly just been
illustrated by facts. Ignorant of the events of yesterday he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) was only
riding over to get some tea, to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) niece, and to observe whether
Miss Honeychurch saw anything beautiful in the desire of two old ladies
to visit Athens.

<p/>A carriage was drawn up outside Windy Corner, and just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) caught
sight of the house it started, bowled up the drive, and stopped abruptly
when it reached the main road. Therefore it must be the horse, who
always expected people to walk up the hill in case they tired him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>). The
door opened obediently, and two men emerged, whom Mr. Beebe recognized
as Cecil and Freddy. They were an odd couple to go driving; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) saw
a trunk beside the coachman's legs. Cecil, who wore a bowler, must be
going away, while Freddy -LRB-a cap-RRB---was seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) to the station. They
walked rapidly, taking the short cuts, and reached the summit while the
carriage was still pursuing the windings of the road.

<p/>They shook hands with the clergyman, but did not speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you're off for a minute, Mr. Vyse?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) asked.

<p/>Cecil said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>while Freddy edged away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends
of Miss Honeychurch.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) quoted from it. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't it wonderful? Isn't it
romance? Most certainly they will go to Constantinople. They are taken
in a snare that cannot fail. They will end by going round the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div><p/>Cecil listened civilly, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was sure that Lucy would be amused
and interested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't Romance capricious! I never notice it in you young people; you
do nothing but play lawn tennis, and say that romance is dead, while the
Miss Alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the
terrible thing. `A really comfortable pension at Constantinople!' So
they call it out of decency, but in their hearts they want a pension
with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland
forlorn! No ordinary view will content the Miss Alans. They want the
Pension Keats.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm awfully sorry to interrupt, Mr. Beebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>said Freddy, <div class="bookquote">``but have you
any matches?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil, and it did not escape Mr. Beebe's notice that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>)
spoke to the boy more kindly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have never met these Miss Alans, have you, Mr. Vyse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you don't see the wonder of this Greek visit. I haven't been
to Greece myself, and don't mean to go, and I can't imagine any of my
friends going. It is altogether too big for our little lot. Don't you
think so? Italy is just about as much as we can manage. Italy is heroic,
but Greece is godlike or devilish--I am not sure which, and in either
case absolutely out of our suburban focus. All right, Freddy--I am
not being clever, upon my word I am not--I took the idea from another
fellow; and give me those matches when you've done with them.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) lit a
cigarette, and went on talking to the two young men. <div class="bookquote">``I was saying, if
our poor little Cockney lives must have a background, let it be Italian.
Big enough in all conscience. The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel for
me. There the contrast is just as much as I can realize. But not the
Parthenon, not the frieze of Phidias at any price; and here comes the
victoria.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're quite right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecil</b></font>)</div>said Cecil. <div class="bookquote">``Greece is not for our little lot'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) got in. Freddy followed, nodding to the clergyman, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>)
trusted not to be pulling one's leg, really. And before they had gone a
dozen yards he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) jumped out, and came running back for Vyse's match-box,
which had not been returned. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) took it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I'm so glad you
only talked about books. Cecil's hard hit. Lucy won't marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>). If
you'd gone on about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), as you did about them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) might have broken
down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But when--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Late last night. I must go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps they won't want me down there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--go on. Good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank goodness!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Beebe to himself, and struck the saddle
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) bicycle approvingly, <div class="bookquote">``It was the one foolish thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) ever
did. Oh, what a glorious riddance!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>And, after a little thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>)
negotiated the slope into Windy Corner, light of heart. The house was
again as it ought to be--cut off forever from Cecil's pretentious world.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) would find Miss Minnie down in the garden.

<p/>In the drawing-room Lucy was tinkling at a Mozart Sonata. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sonata</b></font>) hesitated a
moment, but went down the garden as requested. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonata</b></font>) found a mournful
company. It was a blustering day, and the wind had taken and broken the
dahlias. Mrs. Honeychurch, who looked cross, was tying them up,
while Miss Bartlett, unsuitably dressed, impeded her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) with offers of
assistance. At a little distance stood Minnie and the <div class="bookquote">``garden-child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Minnie/Minnie Beebe</b></font>)</div>a
minute importation, each holding either end of a long piece of bass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how do you do, Mr. Beebe? Gracious what a mess everything is! Look
at my scarlet pompoms, and the wind blowing your skirts about, and the
ground so hard that not a prop will stick in, and then the carriage
having to go out, when I had counted on having Powell, who--give every
one their due--does tie up dahlias properly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Evidently Mrs. Honeychurch was shattered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett, with a meaning glance, as though
conveying that more than dahlias had been broken off by the autumn
gales.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, Lennie, the bass,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Honeychurch. The garden-child, who
did not know what bass was, stood rooted to the path with horror. Minnie
slipped to her (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>) uncle and whispered that everyone was very disagreeable
to-day, and that it was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>) fault if dahlia-strings would tear
longways instead of across.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come for a walk with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You have worried them as much
as they can stand. Mrs. Honeychurch, I only called in aimlessly. I shall
take her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) up to tea at the Beehive Tavern, if I may.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, must you? Yes do.--Not the scissors, thank you, Charlotte, when
both my hands are full already--I'm perfectly certain that the orange
cactus will go before I can get to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe, who was an adept at relieving situations, invited Miss
Bartlett to accompany them to this mild festivity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Charlotte, I don't want you--do go; there's nothing to stop about
for, either in the house or out of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett said that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) duty lay in the dahlia bed, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) had
exasperated everyone, except Minnie, by a refusal, she (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>) turned round and
exasperated Minnie by an acceptance. As they walked up the garden, the
orange cactus fell, and Mr. Beebe's last vision was of the garden-child
clasping it like a lover, his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) dark head buried in a wealth of blossom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is terrible, this havoc among the flowers,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) remarked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a
moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>enunciated Miss Bartlett.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps we ought to send Miss Honeychurch down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) mother. Or will
she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) come with us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think we had better leave Lucy to herself, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own pursuits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They're angry with Miss Honeychurch because she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) was late for
breakfast,''  (<font color='red'><b>Minnie/Minnie Beebe</b></font>)</div>whispered Minnie, <div class="bookquote">``and Floyd has gone, and Mr. Vyse has
gone, and Freddy won't play with me. In fact, Uncle Arthur, the house is
not AT ALL what it was yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Minnie/Minnie Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be a prig,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>) Uncle Arthur. <div class="bookquote">``Go and put on your boots.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) stepped into the drawing-room, where Lucy was still attentively
pursuing the Sonatas of Mozart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) stopped when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mozart</b></font>) entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do? Miss Bartlett and Minnie are coming with me to tea at
the Beehive. Would you come too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I will, thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I didn't suppose you would care to much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy turned to the piano and struck a few chords.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How delicate those Sonatas are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Beebe, though at the bottom
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) thought them silly little things.

<p/>Lucy passed into Schumann.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Honeychurch!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I met them on the hill. Your brother told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sounded annoyed. Mr. Beebe felt hurt, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) had
thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would like him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) to be told.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I needn't say that it will go no further.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, Charlotte, Cecil, Freddy, you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, playing a note for
each person who knew, and then playing a sixth note.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you'll let me say so, I am very glad, and I am certain that you have
done the right thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I hoped other people would think, but they don't seem to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could see that Miss Bartlett thought it unwise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So does mother. Mother minds dreadfully.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Beebe with feeling.

<p/>Mrs. Honeychurch, who hated all changes, did mind, but not nearly as
much as her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) daughter pretended, and only for the minute. It was really
a ruse of Lucy's to justify her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) despondency--a ruse of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was not
herself conscious, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was marching in the armies of darkness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Freddy minds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still, Freddy never hit it off with Vyse much, did he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>)? I gathered that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) disliked the engagement, and felt it might separate him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Boys are so odd.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Minnie/Minnie Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Minnie could be heard arguing with Miss Bartlett through the floor. Tea
at the Beehive apparently involved a complete change of apparel. Mr.
Beebe saw that Lucy--very properly--did not wish to discuss her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) action,
so after a sincere expression of sympathy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I have had an
absurd letter from Miss Alan. That was really what brought me over. I
thought it might amuse you all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How delightful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, in a dull voice.

<p/>For the sake of something to do, he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) began to read her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) the letter. After
a few words her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) eyes grew alert, and soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) with
<div class="bookquote">``Going abroad? When do they start?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Next week, I gather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did Freddy say whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) was driving straight back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) didn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I do hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) won't go gossiping.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did want to talk about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) broken engagement. Always complaisant,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) put the letter away. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), at once exclaimed in a high voice, <div class="bookquote">``Oh,
do tell me more about the Miss Alans! How perfectly splendid of them to
go abroad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want them to start from Venice, and go in a cargo steamer down the
Illyrian coast!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) laughed heartily. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, delightful! I wish they'd take me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Has Italy filled you with the fever of travel? Perhaps George Emerson
is right. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) says that `Italy is only an euphuism for Fate.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, not Italy, but Constantinople. I have always longed to go to
Constantinople. Constantinople is practically Asia, isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) that Constantinople was still unlikely, and that
the Miss Alans only aimed at Athens, <div class="bookquote">``with Delphi, perhaps, if the roads
are safe.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Miss Alans</b></font>)</div>But this made no difference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alans</b></font>) enthusiasm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alans</b></font>) had always
longed to go to Greece even more, it seemed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) saw, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) surprise,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alans</b></font>) was apparently serious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't realize that you and the Miss Alans were still such friends,
after Cissie Villa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's nothing; I assure you Cissie Villa's nothing to me; I would
give anything to go with them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would your mother spare you again so soon? You have scarcely been home
three months.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) MUST spare me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>cried Lucy, in growing excitement. <div class="bookquote">``I simply MUST
go away. I have to.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) ran her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) fingers hysterically through her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hair.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't you see that I HAVE to go away? I didn't realize at the time--and
of course I want to see Constantinople so particularly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes. I knew you'd understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe did not quite understand. Why could not Miss Honeychurch
repose in the bosom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) family? Cecil had evidently taken up the
dignified line, and was not going to annoy her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>). Then it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) family itself might be annoying. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) hinted this to her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>)
accepted the hint eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course; to go to Constantinople until they are used to the idea
and everything has calmed down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid it has been a bothersome business,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) said gently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not at all. Cecil was very kind indeed; only--I had better tell
you the whole truth, since you have heard a little--it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) is
so masterful. I found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) wouldn't let me go my own way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) would
improve me in places where I can't be improved. Cecil won't let a woman
decide for herself--in fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) daren't. What nonsense I do talk! But
that is the kind of thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is what I gathered from my own observation of Mr. Vyse; it is what I
gather from all that I have known of you. I do sympathize and agree
most profoundly. I agree so much that you must let me make one little
criticism: Is it worth while rushing off to Greece?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I must go somewhere!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I have been worrying all the
morning, and here comes the very thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) knees with
clenched fists, and repeated: <div class="bookquote">``I must! And the time I shall have with
mother, and all the money she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spent on me last spring. You all think
much too highly of me. I wish you weren't so kind.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>At this moment Miss
Bartlett entered, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) nervousness increased. <div class="bookquote">``I must get away, ever
so far. I must know my own mind and where I want to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along; tea, tea, tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Beebe, and bustled his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) guests out
of the front-door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) hustled them so quickly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) hat.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) returned for it he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) heard, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) relief and surprise, the
tinkling of a Mozart Sonata.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is playing again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonata</b></font>) said to Miss Bartlett.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy can always play,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the acid reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One is very thankful that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) has such a resource. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) is evidently
much worried, as, of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) ought to be. I know all about it. The
marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
could wind herself up to speak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett gave a kind of wriggle, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonata</b></font>) prepared for a discussion.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sonata</b></font>) had never fathomed Miss Bartlett. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonata</b></font>) had put it to himself
at Florence, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) might yet reveal depths of strangeness, if not of
meaning.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) was so unsympathetic that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) must be reliable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sonata</b></font>)
assumed that much, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonata</b></font>) had no hesitation in discussing Lucy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).
Minnie was fortunately collecting ferns.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>) opened the discussion with: <div class="bookquote">``We had much better let the matter
drop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in
Summer Street. It would be DEATH to gossip about Mr. Vyse's dismissal at
the present moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) eyebrows. Death is a strong word--surely too
strong. There was no question of tragedy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Of course, Miss
Honeychurch will make the fact public in her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) own way, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>)
chooses. Freddy only told me because he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) would not mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bartlett civilly. <div class="bookquote">``Yet Freddy ought not to have told
even you. One cannot be too careful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do implore absolute secrecy. A chance word to a chattering friend,
and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) was used to these nervous old maids and to the exaggerated
importance that they attach to words. A rector lives in a web of petty
secrets, and confidences and warnings, and the wiser he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) is the less he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>)
will regard them. He (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) will change the subject, as did Mr. Beebe, saying
cheerfully: <div class="bookquote">``Have you heard from any Bertolini people lately? I believe
you keep up with Miss Lavish. It is odd how we of that pension,
who seemed such a fortuitous collection, have been working into one
another's lives. Two, three, four, six of us--no, eight; I had forgotten
the Emersons--have kept more or less in touch. We must really give the
Signora a testimonial.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>And, Miss Bartlett not favouring the scheme, they walked up the hill in
a silence which was only broken by the rector naming some fern. On the
summit they paused. The sky had grown wilder since he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) stood there last
hour, giving to the land a tragic greatness that is rare in Surrey.
Grey clouds were charging across tissues of white, which stretched and
shredded and tore slowly, until through their final layers there gleamed
a hint of the disappearing blue. Summer was retreating. The wind roared,
the trees groaned, yet the noise seemed insufficient for those vast
operations in heaven. The weather was breaking up, breaking, broken,
and it is a sense of the fit rather than of the supernatural that equips
such crises with the salvos of angelic artillery. Mr. Beebe's eyes
rested on Windy Corner, where Lucy sat, practising Mozart. No smile came
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mozart</b></font>) lips, and, changing the subject again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mozart</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``We shan't have
rain, but we shall have darkness, so let us hurry on. The darkness last
night was appalling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They reached the Beehive Tavern at about five o’clock. That amiable
hostelry possesses a verandah, in which the young and the unwise do
dearly love to sit, while guests of more mature years seek a pleasant
sanded room, and have tea at a table comfortably. Mr. Beebe saw that
Miss Bartlett would be cold if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) sat out, and that Minnie would be
dull if she (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>) sat in, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) proposed a division of forces. They would hand
the child her (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>) food through the window. Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) was incidentally enabled
to discuss the fortunes of Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been thinking, Miss Bartlett,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and, unless you
very much object, I would like to reopen that discussion.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) bowed.
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing about the past. I know little and care less about that; I am
absolutely certain that it is to your cousin's credit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) has acted
loftily and rightly, and it is like her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) gentle modesty to say that we
think too highly of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>). But the future. Seriously, what do you think of
this Greek plan?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) pulled out the letter again. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know whether
you overheard, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) wants to join the Miss Alans in their mad career.
It's all--I can't explain--it's wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett read the letter in silence, laid it down, seemed to
hesitate, and then read it again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't see the point of it myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>To his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) astonishment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) replied: <div class="bookquote">``There I cannot agree with you. In it
I spy Lucy's salvation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really. Now, why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) wanted to leave Windy Corner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know--but it seems so odd, so unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), so--I was going to
say--selfish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is natural, surely--after such painful scenes--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) should
desire a change.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Here, apparently, was one of those points that the male intellect
misses. Mr. Beebe exclaimed: <div class="bookquote">``So she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) says herself, and since another
lady agrees with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), I must own that I am partially convinced. Perhaps
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must have a change. I have no sisters or--and I don't understand
these things. But why need she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) go as far as Greece?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may well ask that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Bartlett, who was evidently
interested, and had almost dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) evasive manner. <div class="bookquote">``Why Greece?
-LRB-What is it, Minnie dear--jam?-RRB- Why not Tunbridge Wells? Oh, Mr. Beebe!
I had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear Lucy this
morning. I cannot help her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). I will say no more. Perhaps I have already
said too much. I am not to talk. I wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to spend six months with
me at Tunbridge Wells, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) refused.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe poked at a crumb with his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) knife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But my feelings are of no importance. I know too well that I get on
Lucy's nerves. Our tour was a failure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) wanted to leave Florence, and
when we got to Rome she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did not want to be in Rome, and all the time I
felt that I was spending her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother's money--.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us keep to the future, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>interrupted Mr. Beebe. <div class="bookquote">``I want your
advice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, with a choky abruptness that was new to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>), though familiar to Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``I for one will help her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to go to Greece.
Will you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe considered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is absolutely necessary,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) continued, lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) veil and
whispering through it with a passion, an intensity, that surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I know--I know.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The darkness was coming on, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) felt that this odd
woman really did know. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) must not stop here a moment, and we must
keep quiet till she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) goes. I trust that the servants know nothing.
Afterwards--but I may have said too much already. Only, Lucy and I are
helpless against Mrs. Honeychurch alone. If you help we may succeed.
Otherwise--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Otherwise--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Otherwise,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) repeated as if the word held finality.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I will help her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>said the clergyman, setting his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) jaw firm. <div class="bookquote">``Come,
let us go back now, and settle the whole thing up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bartlett/Charlotte Bartlett/Miss Charlotte Bartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bartlett burst into florid gratitude. The tavern sign--a beehive
trimmed evenly with bees--creaked in the wind outside as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) thanked
him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>). Mr. Beebe did not quite understand the situation; but then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) did
not desire to understand it, nor to jump to the conclusion of <div class="bookquote">``another
man''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>that would have attracted a grosser mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) only felt that Miss
Bartlett knew of some vague influence from which the girl desired to be
delivered, and which might well be clothed in the fleshly form. Its very
vagueness spurred him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) into knight-errantry. His (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) belief in celibacy, so
reticent, so carefully concealed beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) tolerance and culture, now
came to the surface and expanded like some delicate flower. <div class="bookquote">``They that
marry do well, but they that refrain do better.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So ran his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) belief,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) never heard that an engagement was broken off but with a slight
feeling of pleasure. In the case of Lucy, the feeling was intensified
through dislike of Cecil; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was willing to go further--to place her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
out of danger until she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could confirm her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) resolution of virginity. The
feeling was very subtle and quite undogmatic, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) never imparted it
to any other of the characters in this entanglement. Yet it existed,
and it alone explains his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) action subsequently, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) influence on the
action of others. The compact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) made with Miss Bartlett in the
tavern, was to help not only Lucy, but religion also.

<p/>They hurried home through a world of black and grey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) conversed on
indifferent topics: the Emersons' need of a housekeeper; servants;
Italian servants; novels about Italy; novels with a purpose; could
literature influence life? Windy Corner glimmered. In the garden, Mrs.
Honeychurch, now helped by Freddy, still wrestled with the lives of her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>)
flowers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It gets too dark,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) said hopelessly. <div class="bookquote">``This comes of putting off. We
might have known the weather would break up soon; and now Lucy wants to
go to Greece. I don't know what the world's coming to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Honeychurch,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``go to Greece she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) must. Come up to the
house and let's talk it over. Do you, in the first place, mind her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>)
breaking with Vyse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Beebe, I'm thankful--simply thankful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So am I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>said Freddy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good. Now come up to the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They conferred in the dining-room for half an hour.

<p/>Lucy would never have carried the Greek scheme alone. It was expensive
and dramatic--both qualities that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother loathed. Nor would
Charlotte have succeeded. The honours of the day rested with Mr. Beebe.
By his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) tact and common sense, and by his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) influence as a clergyman--for
a clergyman who was not a fool influenced Mrs. Honeychurch greatly--he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>)
bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) to their purpose, <div class="bookquote">``I don't see why Greece is necessary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>)
said; <div class="bookquote">``but as you do, I suppose it is all right. It must be something I
can't understand. Lucy! Let's tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). Lucy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) is playing the piano,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>Mr. Beebe said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) opened the door, and
heard the words of a song:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look not thou on beauty's charming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know that Miss Honeychurch sang, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit thou still when kings are arming,
Taste not when the wine-cup glistens--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a song that Cecil gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>). How odd girls are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>called Lucy, stopping short.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Honeychurch kindly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) went into the
drawing-room, and Mr. Beebe heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) kiss Lucy and say: <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry I
was so cross about Greece, but it came on the top of the dahlias.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Rather a hard voice said: <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, mother; that doesn't matter a
bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are right, too--Greece will be all right; you can go if the
Miss Alans will have you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, splendid! Oh, thank you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe followed. Lucy still sat at the piano with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hands over the
keys. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was glad, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) had expected greater gladness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother
bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). Freddy, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had been singing, reclined on the
floor with his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) head against her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), and an unlit pipe between his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) lips.
Oddly enough, the group was beautiful. Mr. Beebe, who loved the art of
the past, was reminded of a favourite theme, the Santa Conversazione,
in which people who care for one another are painted chatting together
about noble things--a theme neither sensual nor sensational, and
therefore ignored by the art of to-day. Why should Lucy want either to
marry or to travel when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had such friends at home?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Taste not when the wine-cup glistens,
Speak not when the people listens,''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) continued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's Mr. Beebe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Beebe knows my rude ways.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a beautiful song and a wise one,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said listlessly. <div class="bookquote">``I forget why--harmony or
something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suspected it was unscholarly. It's so beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The tune's right enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>said Freddy, <div class="bookquote">``but the words are rotten. Why
throw up the sponge?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How stupidly you talk!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) sister. The Santa Conversazione was
broken up. After all, there was no reason that Lucy should talk about
Greece or thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) for persuading her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) said good-bye.

<p/>Freddy lit his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) bicycle lamp for him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) in the porch, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) usual
felicity of phrase, said: <div class="bookquote">``This has been a day and a half.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop thine ear against the singer--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait a minute; she (<font color='blue'><b>thine</b></font>) is finishing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From the red gold keep thy finger;
Vacant heart and hand and eye
Easy live and quiet die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I love weather like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>said Freddy.

<p/>Mr. Beebe passed into it.

<p/>The two main facts were clear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had behaved splendidly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) had
helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) could not expect to master the details of so big a change
in a girl's life. If here and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) was dissatisfied or puzzled, he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>)
must acquiesce; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was choosing the better part.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vacant heart and hand and eye--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Perhaps the song stated <div class="bookquote">``the better part''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>rather too strongly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) half
fancied that the soaring accompaniment--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) did not lose in the
shout of the gale--really agreed with Freddy, and was gently criticizing
the words that it adorned:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vacant heart and hand and eye
Easy live and quiet die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div><p/>However, for the fourth time Windy Corner lay poised below him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>)--now as a
beacon in the roaring tides of darkness.



<p/>Chapter XIX: Lying to Mr. Emerson

<p/>The Miss Alans were found in their beloved temperance hotel near
Bloomsbury--a clean, airless establishment much patronized by provincial
England. They always perched there before crossing the great seas,
and for a week or two would fidget gently over clothes, guide-books,
mackintosh squares, digestive bread, and other Continental necessaries.
That there are shops abroad, even in Athens, never occurred to them, for
they regarded travel as a species of warfare, only to be undertaken
by those who have been fully armed at the Haymarket Stores. Miss
Honeychurch, they trusted, would take care to equip herself duly.
Quinine could now be obtained in tabloids; paper soap was a great help
towards freshening up one's face in the train. Lucy promised, a little
depressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, of course, you know all about these things, and you have Mr. Vyse
to help you. A gentleman is such a stand-by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Honeychurch, who had come up to town with her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) daughter, began to
drum nervously upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) card-case.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We think it so good of Mr. Vyse to spare you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Alan/Miss Catharine Alan/Miss Catharine</b></font>)</div>Miss Catharine
continued. <div class="bookquote">``It is not every young man who would be so unselfish. But
perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will come out and join you later on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or does his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work keep him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in London?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Teresa/Teresa</b></font>)</div>said Miss Teresa, the more acute
and less kindly of the two sisters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``However, we shall see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sees you off. I do so long to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one will see Lucy off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>interposed Mrs. Honeychurch. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) doesn't
like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I hate seeings-off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really? How funny! I should have thought that in this case--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, you aren't going? It is such a pleasure to have
met you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>They escaped, and Lucy said with relief: <div class="bookquote">``That's all right. We just got
through that time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother was annoyed. <div class="bookquote">``I should be told, dear, that I am
unsympathetic. But I cannot see why you didn't tell your friends about
Cecil and be done with it. There all the time we had to sit fencing, and
almost telling lies, and be seen through, too, I dare say, which is most
unpleasant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy had plenty to say in reply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) described the Miss Alans'
character: they were such gossips, and if one told them, the news would
be everywhere in no time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why shouldn't it be everywhere in no time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I settled with Cecil not to announce it until I left England. I
shall tell them then. It's much pleasanter. How wet it is! Let's turn in
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>was the British Museum. Mrs. Honeychurch refused. If they must
take shelter, let it be in a shop. Lucy felt contemptuous, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was
on the tack of caring for Greek sculpture, and had already borrowed a
mythical dictionary from Mr. Beebe to get up the names of the goddesses
and gods.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, let it be shop, then. Let's go to Mudie's. I'll buy a
guide-book.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, Lucy, you and Charlotte and Mr. Beebe all tell me I'm
so stupid, so I suppose I am, but I shall never understand this
hole-and-corner work. You've got rid of Cecil--well and good, and I'm
thankful he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>)'s gone, though I did feel angry for the minute. But why not
announce it? Why this hushing up and tip-toeing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only for a few days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why at all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy was silent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was drifting away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother. It was quite
easy to say, <div class="bookquote">``Because George Emerson has been bothering me, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>)
hears I've given up Cecil may begin again'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--quite easy, and it had
the incidental advantage of being true. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not say it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
disliked confidences, for they might lead to self-knowledge and to that
king of terrors--Light. Ever since that last evening at Florence she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had
deemed it unwise to reveal her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) soul.

<p/>Mrs. Honeychurch, too, was silent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) was thinking, <div class="bookquote">``My daughter won't
answer me; she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than
with Freddy and me. Any rag, tag, and bobtail apparently does if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
can leave her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) home.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>And as in her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) case thoughts never remained unspoken
long, she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) burst out with: <div class="bookquote">``You're tired of Windy Corner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This was perfectly true. Lucy had hoped to return to Windy Corner when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) escaped from Cecil, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) discovered that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) home existed no
longer. It might exist for Freddy, who still lived and thought straight,
but not for one who had deliberately warped the brain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did not
acknowledge that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) brain was warped, for the brain itself must assist
in that acknowledgment, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was disordering the very instruments of
life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) only felt, <div class="bookquote">``I do not love George; I broke off my engagement
because I did not love George; I must go to Greece because I do not
love George; it is more important that I should look up gods in the
dictionary than that I should help my mother; everyone else is behaving
very badly.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) only felt irritable and petulant, and anxious to do
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was not expected to do, and in this spirit she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) proceeded with
the conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother, what rubbish you talk! Of course I'm not tired of Windy
Corner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why not say so at once, instead of considering half an hour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) laughed faintly, <div class="bookquote">``Half a minute would be nearer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, mother! People will hear you'' (<font color='red'><b>Mudie</b></font>)</div>; for they had entered Mudie's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
bought Baedeker, and then continued: <div class="bookquote">``Of course I want to live at home;
but as we are talking about it, I may as well say that I shall want to
be away in the future more than I have been. You see, I come into my
money next year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baedeker</b></font>)</div><p/>Tears came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother's eyes.

<p/>Driven by nameless bewilderment, by what is in older people termed
<div class="bookquote">``eccentricity,''  (<font color='red'><b>people eccentricity</b></font>)</div>Lucy determined to make this point clear. <div class="bookquote">``I've seen the
world so little--I felt so out of things in Italy. I have seen so little
of life; one ought to come up to London more--not a cheap ticket like
to-day, but to stop. I might even share a flat for a little with some
other girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And mess with typewriters and latch-keys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>exploded Mrs. Honeychurch.
<div class="bookquote">``And agitate and scream, and be carried off kicking by the police. And
call it a Mission--when no one wants you! And call it Duty--when
it means that you can't stand your own home! And call it Work--when
thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is! And then
to prepare yourself, find two doddering old ladies, and go abroad with
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want more independence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy lamely; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) wanted
something, and independence is a useful cry; we can always say that we
have not got it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) tried to remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) emotions in Florence: those
had been sincere and passionate, and had suggested beauty rather than
short skirts and latch-keys. But independence was certainly her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. Take your independence and be gone. Rush up and down and
round the world, and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food.
Despise the house that your father built and the garden that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) planted,
and our dear view--and then share a flat with another girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy screwed up her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mouth and said: <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I spoke hastily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, goodness!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother flashed. <div class="bookquote">``How you do remind me of Charlotte
Bartlett!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Charlotte!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>flashed Lucy in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) turn, pierced at last by a vivid pain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``More every moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean, mother; Charlotte and I are not the very
least alike.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I see the likeness. The same eternal worrying, the same taking
back of words. You and Charlotte trying to divide two apples among three
people last night might be sisters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What rubbish! And if you dislike Charlotte so, it's rather a pity you
asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to stop. I warned you about her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); I begged you, implored you
not to, but of course it was not listened to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There you go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Charlotte again, my dear; that's all; her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) very words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy clenched her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) teeth. <div class="bookquote">``My point is that you oughtn't to have
asked Charlotte to stop. I wish you would keep to the point.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And the
conversation died off into a wrangle.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother shopped in silence, spoke little in the train, little
again in the carriage, which met them at Dorking Station. It had poured
all day and as they ascended through the deep Surrey lanes showers of
water fell from the over-hanging beech-trees and rattled on the hood.
Lucy complained that the hood was stuffy. Leaning forward, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) looked
out into the steaming dusk, and watched the carriage-lamp pass like a
search-light over mud and leaves, and reveal nothing beautiful. <div class="bookquote">``The
crush when Charlotte gets in will be abominable,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) remarked. For
they were to pick up Miss Bartlett at Summer Street, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) had been
dropped as the carriage went down, to pay a call on Mr. Beebe's old
mother. <div class="bookquote">``We shall have to sit three a side, because the trees drop, and
yet it isn't raining. Oh, for a little air!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) listened to the
horse's hoofs--<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has not told--he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has not told.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>That melody was
blurred by the soft road. <div class="bookquote">``CAN'T we have the hood down?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) demanded,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother, with sudden tenderness, said: <div class="bookquote">``Very well, old lady, stop
the horse.''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>And the horse was stopped, and Lucy and Powell wrestled with
the hood, and squirted water down Mrs. Honeychurch's neck. But now
that the hood was down, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did see something that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would have
missed--there were no lights in the windows of Cissie Villa, and round
the garden gate she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw a padlock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that house to let again, Powell?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) called.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Powell</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have they gone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is too far out of town for the young gentleman, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) father's
rheumatism has come on, so he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) can't stop on alone, so they are trying to
let furnished,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They have gone, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss, they have gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy sank back. The carriage stopped at the Rectory. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) got out to call
for Miss Bartlett. So the Emersons had gone, and all this bother about
Greece had been unnecessary. Waste! That word seemed to sum up the whole
of life. Wasted plans, wasted money, wasted love, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) had wounded
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) mother. Was it possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) had muddled things away? Quite
possible. Other people had. When the maid opened the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was
unable to speak, and stared stupidly into the hall.

<p/>Miss Bartlett at once came forward, and after a long preamble asked
a great favour: might she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) go to church? Mr. Beebe and his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) mother had
already gone, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had refused to start until she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) obtained her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
hostess's full sanction, for it would mean keeping the horse waiting a
good ten minutes more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the hostess</b></font>)</div>said the hostess wearily. <div class="bookquote">``I forgot it was Friday. Let's
all go. Powell can go round to the stables.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy dearest--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No church for me, thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A sigh, and they departed. The church was invisible, but up in the
darkness to the left there was a hint of colour. This was a stained
window, through which some feeble light was shining, and when the door
opened Lucy heard Mr. Beebe's voice running through the litany to a
minute congregation. Even their church, built upon the slope of the hill
so artfully, with its beautiful raised transept and its spire of silvery
shingle--even their church had lost its charm; and the thing one never
talked about--religion--was fading like all the other things.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) followed the maid into the Rectory.

<p/>Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) object to sitting in Mr. Beebe's study? There was only that
one fire.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would not object.

<p/>Some one was there already, for Lucy heard the words: <div class="bookquote">``A lady to wait,
sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Old Mr. Emerson was sitting by the fire, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) foot upon a
gout-stool.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Miss Honeychurch, that you should come!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) quavered; and Lucy saw
an alteration in him (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) since last Sunday.

<p/>Not a word would come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) lips. George she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had faced, and could have
faced again, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had forgotten how to treat his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Honeychurch, dear, we are so sorry! George is so sorry! He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thought
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had a right to try. I cannot blame my boy, and yet I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had told
me first. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ought not to have tried. I knew nothing about it at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>If only she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could remember how to behave!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) held up his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``But you must not scold him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) back, and began to look at Mr. Beebe's books.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I taught him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) quavered, ``to trust in love. I said: `When love
comes, that is reality.' I said: `Passion does not blind. No. Passion
is sanity, and the woman you love, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is the only person you will ever
really understand.''' He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sighed: ``True, everlastingly true, though my day
is over, and though there is the result. Poor boy! He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is so sorry!
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in; that
whatever you felt you did not mean. Yet''--his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) voice gathered strength:
he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) spoke out to make certain--<div class="bookquote">``Miss Honeychurch, do you remember Italy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy selected a book--a volume of Old Testament commentaries. Holding
it up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I have no wish to discuss Italy or any
subject connected with your son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you do remember it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has misbehaved himself from the first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only was told that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) loved you last Sunday. I never could judge
behaviour. I--I--suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Feeling a little steadier, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) put the book back and turned round to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) face was drooping and swollen, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) eyes, though they were
sunken deep, gleamed with a child's courage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has behaved abominably,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I am glad he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is sorry. Do
you know what he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) did?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Not `abominably,''' was the gentle correction. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) only tried when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
should not have tried. You have all you want, Miss Honeychurch: you are
going to marry the man you love. Do not go out of George's life saying
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is abominable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, ashamed at the reference to Cecil.
```Abominable' is much too strong. I am sorry I used it about your son. I
think I will go to church, after all. My mother and my cousin have gone.
I shall not be so very late--''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Especially as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has gone under,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gone under naturally.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) beat his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) palms together in silence; his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) head
fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) chest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Mr. Emerson--MR. EMERSON--what are you talking about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When I wouldn't have George baptized,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>).

<p/>Lucy was frightened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) agreed that baptism was nothing, but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) caught that fever
when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was twelve and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) turned round. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought it a judgement.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
shuddered. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, horrible, when we had given up that sort of thing and
broken away from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) parents. Oh, horrible--worst of all--worse than
death, when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness, planted
your little garden, let in your sunlight, and then the weeds creep in
again! A judgement! And our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had
dropped water on him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) in church! Is it possible, Miss Honeychurch? Shall
we slip back into the darkness for ever?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>gasped Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``I don't understand this sort of thing. I
was not meant to understand it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Mr. Eager--he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) came when I was out, and acted according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
principles. I don't blame him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) or any one... but by the time George
was well she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) was ill. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) think about sin, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Honeychurch</b></font>) went under
thinking about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div><p/>It was thus that Mr. Emerson had murdered his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) wife in the sight of God.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how terrible!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own affairs at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was not baptized,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man. <div class="bookquote">``I did hold firm.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
looked with unwavering eyes at the rows of books, as if--at what
cost!--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had won a victory over them. <div class="bookquote">``My boy shall go back to the
earth untouched.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) asked whether young Mr. Emerson was ill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--last Sunday.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) started into the present. <div class="bookquote">``George last Sunday--no,
not ill: just gone under. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is never ill. But he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother's son.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes were his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had that forehead that I think so beautiful,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will not think it worth while to live. It was always touch and
go. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will live; but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will not think it worth while to live. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will
never think anything worth while. You remember that church at Florence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy did remember, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had suggested that George should collect
postage stamps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``After you left Florence--horrible. Then we took the house here, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)

well, one must have failures. George comes down to-morrow, and takes me
up to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) London rooms. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) can't bear to be about here, and I must be

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly you can. We either have you in our lives, or leave you to the
life that you have chosen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't want--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose Mr. Vyse is very angry with George? No, it was wrong of
George to try. We have pushed our beliefs too far. I fancy that we
deserve sorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked at the books again--black, brown, and that acrid theological
blue. They surrounded the visitors on every side; they were piled on the
tables, they pressed against the very ceiling. To Lucy who could not see
that Mr. Emerson was profoundly religious, and differed from Mr. Beebe
chiefly by his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) acknowledgment of passion--it seemed dreadful that the
old man should crawl into such a sanctum, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was unhappy, and be
dependent on the bounty of a clergyman.

<p/>More certain than ever that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was tired, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, please sit still. I think I will sit in the carriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Honeychurch, you do sound tired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, with trembling lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are, and there's a look of George about you. And what were you
saying about going abroad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Greece'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was thinking the word over--<div class="bookquote">``Greece; but
you were to be married this year, I thought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not till January, it wasn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hands. Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
tell an actual lie when it came to the point?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose that Mr. Vyse is going with you. I hope--it isn't because
George spoke that you are both going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope that you will enjoy Greece with Mr. Vyse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment Mr. Beebe came back from church. His (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) cassock was covered
with rain. <div class="bookquote">``That's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) said kindly. <div class="bookquote">``I counted on you two
keeping each other company. It's pouring again. The entire congregation,
which consists of your cousin, your mother, and my mother, stands
waiting in the church, till the carriage fetches it. Did Powell go
round?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so; I'll see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--of course, I'll see. How are the Miss Alans?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you tell Mr. Emerson about Greece?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think it very plucky of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alans</b></font>), Mr. Emerson, to undertake the
two Miss Alans? Now, Miss Honeychurch, go back--keep warm. I think three
is such a courageous number to go travelling.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) hurried off to the
stables.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) is not going,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said hoarsely. <div class="bookquote">``I made a slip. Mr. Vyse does stop
behind in England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>this man</b></font>)</div><p/>Somehow it was impossible to cheat this old man. To George, to Cecil,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would have lied again; but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) seemed so near the end of things, so
dignified in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) approach to the gulf, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) gave one account, and
the books that surrounded him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) another, so mild to the rough paths that
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had traversed, that the true chivalry--not the worn-out chivalry
of sex, but the true chivalry that all the young may show to all the
old--awoke in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), and, at whatever risk, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) that Cecil was
not her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) companion to Greece. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) spoke so seriously that the risk
became a certainty, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>), lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) eyes, said: <div class="bookquote">``You are leaving
him (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>)? You are leaving the man you love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I had to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Miss Honeychurch, why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Terror came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) lied again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) made the long, convincing
speech that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had made to Mr. Beebe, and intended to make to the world
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) announced that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) engagement was no more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) in
silence, and then said: <div class="bookquote">``My dear, I am worried about you. It seems to
me'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>--dreamily; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was not alarmed--<div class="bookquote">``that you are in a muddle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take an old man's word; there's nothing worse than a muddle in all the
world. It is easy to face Death and Fate, and the things that sound
so dreadful. It is on my muddles that I look back with horror--on the
things that I might have avoided. We can help one another but little. I
used to think I could teach young people the whole of life, but I know
better now, and all my teaching of George has come down to this: beware
of muddle. Do you remember in that church, when you pretended to be
annoyed with me and weren't? Do you remember before, when you refused
the room with the view? Those were muddles--little, but ominous--and I
am fearing that you are in one now.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was silent. <div class="bookquote">``Don't trust me,
Miss Honeychurch. Though life is very glorious, it is difficult.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was still silent. ```Life' wrote a friend of mine, `is a public
performance on the violin, in which you must learn the instrument as you
go along.' I think he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) puts it well. Man has to pick up the use of his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>)
functions as he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) goes along--especially the function of Love.'' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>)
burst out excitedly; <div class="bookquote">``That's it; that's what I mean. You love George!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And after his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) long preamble, the three words burst against Lucy like
waves from the open sea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) went on, not waiting for contradiction. <div class="bookquote">``You love the
boy body and soul, plainly, directly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) loves you, and no other word
expresses it. You won't marry the other man for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How dare you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>gasped Lucy, with the roaring of waters in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) ears.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, how like a man!--I mean, to suppose that a woman is always thinking
about a man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) summoned physical disgust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're shocked, but I mean to shock you. It's the only hope at times. I
can reach you no other way. You must marry, or your life will be wasted.
You have gone too far to retreat. I have no time for the tenderness, and
the comradeship, and the poetry, and the things that really matter, and
for which you marry. I know that, with George, you will find them, and
that you love him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). Then be his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is already part of you. Though
you fly to Greece, and never see him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) again, or forget his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) very name,
George will work in your thoughts till you die. It isn't possible to
love and to part. You will wish that it was. You can transmute love,
ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you. I know by
experience that the poets are right: love is eternal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy began to cry with anger, and though her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) anger passed away soon, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
tears remained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I only wish poets would say this, too: love is of the body; not
the body, but of the body. Ah! the misery that would be saved if we
confessed that! Ah! for a little directness to liberate the soul! Your
soul, dear Lucy! I hate the word now, because of all the cant with which
superstition has wrapped it round. But we have souls. I cannot say how
they came nor whither they go, but we have them, and I see you ruining
yours. I cannot bear it. It is again the darkness creeping in; it
is hell.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) checked himself. <div class="bookquote">``What nonsense I have talked--how
abstract and remote! And I have made you cry! Dear girl, forgive my
prosiness; marry my boy. When I think what life is, and how seldom love
is answered by love--Marry him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); it is one of the moments for which the
world was made.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>); the words were indeed remote. Yet as he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>)
spoke the darkness was withdrawn, veil after veil, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw to the
bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) soul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, Lucy--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've frightened me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) moaned. <div class="bookquote">``Cecil--Mr. Beebe--the ticket's

 (<font color='red'><b>the front-door</b></font>)</div><p/>A carriage drew up at the front-door.

<p/>``Give George my love--once only. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) `muddle.''' Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) arranged
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) veil, while the tears poured over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cheeks inside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--they are in the hall--oh, please not, Mr. Emerson--they trust me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why should they, when you have deceived them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe opened the door, saying: <div class="bookquote">``Here's my mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not worthy of their trust.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Beebe sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was saying, why should you trust her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) deceived you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One minute, mother.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) came in and shut the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't follow you, Mr. Emerson. To whom do you refer? Trust whom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has pretended to you that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not love George. They have
loved one another all along.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe looked at the sobbing girl. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) was very quiet, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) white
face, with its ruddy whiskers, seemed suddenly inhuman. A long black
column, he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) stood and awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never marry him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>quavered Lucy.

<p/>A look of contempt came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Beebe--I have misled you--I have misled myself--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, rubbish, Miss Honeychurch!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not rubbish!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man hotly. <div class="bookquote">``It's the part of people
that you don't understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beebe/Beebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Beebe laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) hand on the old man's shoulder pleasantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy! Lucy!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>called voices from the carriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Beebe, could you help me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) looked amazed at the request, and said in a low, stern voice: <div class="bookquote">``I
am more grieved than I can possibly express. It is lamentable,
lamentable--incredible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's wrong with the boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>fired up the other again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, Mr. Emerson, except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) no longer interests me. Marry
George, Miss Honeychurch. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will do admirably.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) walked out and left them. They heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) guiding his (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) mother
up-stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the voices called.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) turned to Mr. Emerson in despair. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) face revived her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). It was
the face of a saint who understood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now it is all dark. Now Beauty and Passion seem never to have existed.
I know. But remember the mountains over Florence and the view. Ah, dear,
if I were George, and gave you one kiss, it would make you brave. You

that you have made yourself; and your mother and all your friends
will despise you, oh, my darling, and rightly, if it is ever right to
despise. George still dark, all the tussle and the misery without a word
from him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). Am I justified?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Into his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) own eyes tears came. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, for we

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You kiss me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl. <div class="bookquote">``You kiss me. I will try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a sense of deities reconciled, a feeling that, in gaining
the man she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) loved, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would gain something for the whole world.
Throughout the squalor of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) homeward drive--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) spoke at once--his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
salutation remained. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had robbed the body of its taint, the world's
taunts of their sting; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had shown her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) the holiness of direct desire.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``never exactly understood,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would say in after years, <div class="bookquote">``how he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter XX: The End of the Middle Ages

<p/>The Miss Alans did go to Greece, but they went by themselves. They alone
of this little company will double Malea and plough the waters of the
Saronic gulf. They alone will visit Athens and Delphi, and either shrine
of intellectual song--that upon the Acropolis, encircled by blue seas;
that under Parnassus, where the eagles build and the bronze charioteer
drives undismayed towards infinity. Trembling, anxious, cumbered with
much digestive bread, they did proceed to Constantinople, they did go
round the world. The rest of us must be contented with a fair, but a
less arduous, goal. Italiam petimus: we return to the Pension Bertolini.

<p/>George said it was his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) old room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it isn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>said Lucy; <div class="bookquote">``because it is the room I had, and I had your
father's room. I forget why; Charlotte made me, for some reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) knelt on the tiled floor, and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) lap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George, you baby, get up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't I be a baby?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>murmured George.

<p/>Unable to answer this question, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) put down his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sock, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was
trying to mend, and gazed out through the window. It was evening and
again the spring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, bother Charlotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``What can such people be
made of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Same stuff as parsons are made of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite right. It is nonsense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you get up off the cold floor, or you'll be starting rheumatism
next, and you stop laughing and being so silly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't I laugh?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) asked, pinning her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) elbows, and
advancing his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) face to hers. <div class="bookquote">``What's there to cry at? Kiss me here.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
indicated the spot where a kiss would be welcome.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was a boy after all. When it came to the point, it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) who
remembered the past, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) into whose soul the iron had entered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
who knew whose room this had been last year. It endeared him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
strangely that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) should be sometimes wrong.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Any letters?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just a line from Freddy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now kiss me here; then here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, threatened again with rheumatism, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) strolled to the window,
opened it -LRB-as the English will-RRB-, and leant out. There was the parapet,
there the river, there to the left the beginnings of the hills. The
cab-driver, who at once saluted him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) with the hiss of a serpent, might
be that very Phaethon who had set this happiness in motion twelve
months ago. A passion of gratitude--all feelings grow to passions in the
South--came over the husband, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) blessed the people and the things
who had taken so much trouble about a young fool. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had helped himself,
it is true, but how stupidly!

<p/>All the fighting that mattered had been done by others--by Italy, by his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
father, by his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy, you come and look at the cypresses; and the church, whatever its
name is, still shows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``San Miniato. I'll just finish your sock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Signorino, domani faremo uno giro,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cabman</b></font>)</div>called the cabman, with engaging
certainty.

<p/>George told him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was mistaken; they had no money to throw away on
driving.

<p/>And the people who had not meant to help--the Miss Lavishes, the Cecils,
the Miss Bartletts! Ever prone to magnify Fate, George counted up the
forces that had swept him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) into this contentment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything good in Freddy's letter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own content was absolute, but hers held bitterness: the
Honeychurches had not forgiven them; they were disgusted at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) past
hypocrisy; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had alienated Windy Corner, perhaps for ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Silly boy! He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>)'s being dignified. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) knew we should go off in

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it will all come right in the end. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) has to build us both up
from the beginning again. I wish, though, that Cecil had not turned so
cynical about women. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) has, for the second time, quite altered. Why
will men have theories about women? I haven't any about men. I wish,
too, that Mr. Beebe--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may well wish that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) will never forgive us--I mean, he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) will never be interested in us
again. I wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) did not influence them so much at Windy Corner. I
wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) hadn't--But if we act the truth, the people who really love us
are sure to come back to us in the long run.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said more gently: <div class="bookquote">``Well, I acted the truth--the
only thing I did do--and you came back to me. So possibly you know.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
turned back into the room. <div class="bookquote">``Nonsense with that sock.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) carried her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
to the window, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), too, saw all the view. They sank upon their
knees, invisible from the road, they hoped, and began to whisper one
another's names. Ah! it was worth while; it was the great joy that they
had expected, and countless little joys of which they had never dreamt.
They were silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Signorino, domani faremo--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, bother that man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>But Lucy remembered the vendor of photographs and said, <div class="bookquote">``No, don't be
rude to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>the vendor</b></font>)</div>Then with a catching of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) breath, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) murmured: <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Eager and Charlotte, dreadful frozen Charlotte. How cruel she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would be
to a man like that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at the lights going over the bridge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But this room reminds me of Charlotte. How horrible to grow old in
Charlotte's way! To think that evening at the rectory that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) shouldn't
have heard your father was in the house. For she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would have stopped me
going in, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was the only person alive who could have made me see
sense. You couldn't have made me. When I am very happy'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) kissed
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``I remember on how little it all hangs. If Charlotte had only
known, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would have stopped me going in, and I should have gone to
silly Greece, and become different for ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did know,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div>said George; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did see my father, surely. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said
so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) didn't see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was upstairs with old Mrs. Beebe, don't
you remember, and then went straight to the church. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>) said so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div><p/>George was obstinate again. <div class="bookquote">``My father,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Beebe</b></font>), and I prefer
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) word. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was dozing by the study fire, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes,
and there was Miss Bartlett. A few minutes before you came in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) was
turning to go as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) woke up. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) didn't speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then they spoke of other things--the desultory talk of those who have
been fighting to reach one another, and whose reward is to rest quietly
in each other's arms. It was long ere they returned to Miss Bartlett,
but when they did her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) behaviour seemed more interesting. George, who
disliked any darkness, said: <div class="bookquote">``It's clear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) knew. Then, why
did she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) risk the meeting? She (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was there, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) went to
church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div><p/>They tried to piece the thing together.

<p/>As they talked, an incredible solution came into Lucy's mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
rejected it, and said: <div class="bookquote">``How like Charlotte to undo her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) work by a feeble
muddle at the last moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>But something in the dying evening, in the
roar of the river, in their very embrace warned them that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) words fell
short of life, and George whispered: <div class="bookquote">``Or did she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mean it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Emerson/George Emerson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mean what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Signorino, domani faremo uno giro--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy bent forward and said with gentleness: <div class="bookquote">``Lascia, prego, lascia.
Siamo sposati.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Scusi tanto, signora,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) replied in tones as gentle and whipped up his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
horse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Buona sera--e grazie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Niente.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The cabman</b></font>)</div><p/>The cabman drove away singing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mean what, George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) whispered: <div class="bookquote">``Is it this? Is this possible? I'll put a marvel to you.
That your cousin has always hoped. That from the very first moment we
met, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hoped, far down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mind, that we should be like this--of
course, very far down. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) fought us on the surface, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
hoped. I can't explain her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) any other way. Can you? Look how she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) kept me
alive in you all the summer; how she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) gave you no peace; how month after
month she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) became more eccentric and unreliable. The sight of us haunted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)--or she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) couldn't have described us as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) friend. There
are details--it burnt. I read the book afterwards. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is not frozen,
Lucy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) is not withered up all through. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) tore us apart twice, but
in the rectory that evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was given one more chance to make us
happy. We can never make friends with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) or thank her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). But I do believe
that, far down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) heart, far below all speech and behaviour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) is
glad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is impossible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Honeychurch/Honeychurch</b></font>)</div>murmured Lucy, and then, remembering the experiences
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own heart, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``No--it is just possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Youth enwrapped them; the song of Phaethon announced passion requited,
love attained. But they were conscious of a love more mysterious than
this. The song died away; they heard the river, bearing down the snows
of winter into the Mediterranean.
