<p/>Persuasion


<p/>by

<p/>Jane Austen

<p/>-LRB-1818-RRB-




<p/>Chapter 1


<p/>Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who,
for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed
one; there his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by
contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there any
unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs changed naturally
into pity and contempt as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned over the almost endless creations
of the last century; and there, if every other leaf were powerless, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
could read his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own history with an interest which never failed. This
was the page at which the favourite volume always opened:

<p/>``ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married, July 15, 1784, Elizabeth,
daughter of James Stevenson, Esq. of South Park, in the county of
Gloucester, by which lady -LRB-who died 1800-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Stevenson</b></font>) has issue Elizabeth, born
June 1, 1785; Anne, born August 9, 1787; a still-born son, November 5,
1789; Mary, born November 20, 1791.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer's
hands; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding, for the information of
himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) family, these words, after the date of Mary's birth--
<div class="bookquote">``Married, December 16, 1810, Charles, son and heir of Charles Musgrove,
Esq. of Uppercross, in the county of Somerset,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>and by inserting most
accurately the day of the month on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) wife.

<p/>Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable
family, in the usual terms; how it had been first settled in Cheshire;
how mentioned in Dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff,
representing a borough in three successive parliaments, exertions of
loyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year of Charles II, with
all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married; forming altogether two
handsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with the arms and
motto:--<div class="bookquote">``Principal seat, Kellynch Hall, in the county of Somerset,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marys Elizabeths</b></font>)</div>and
Sir Walter's handwriting again in this finale:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heir presumptive, William Walter Elliot, Esq., great grandson of the
second Sir Walter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot's character;
vanity of person and of situation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had been remarkably handsome in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man. Few women
could think more of their personal appearance than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did, nor could
the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held
in society. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to
the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot, who united
these gifts, was the constant object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) warmest respect and
devotion.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) good looks and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) rank had one fair claim on his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) attachment; since
to them he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) must have owed a wife of very superior character to any
thing deserved by his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) own. Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman,
sensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be
pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) Lady Elliot, had never
required indulgence afterwards.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had humoured, or softened, or
concealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) failings, and promoted his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) real respectability for
seventeen years; and though not the very happiest being in the world
herself, had found enough in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) duties, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) friends, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) children,
to attach her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) to life, and make it no matter of indifference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was called on to quit them.--Three girls, the two eldest
sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath, an
awful charge rather, to confide to the authority and guidance of a
conceited, silly father. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had, however, one very intimate friend, a
sensible, deserving woman, who had been brought, by strong attachment
to herself, to settle close by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), in the village of Kellynch; and on
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kindness and advice, Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help
and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had
been anxiously giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) daughters.

<p/>This friend, and Sir Walter, did not marry, whatever might have been
anticipated on that head by their acquaintance. Thirteen years had
passed away since Lady Elliot's death, and they were still near
neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower, the other
a widow.

<p/>That Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely well
provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage, needs no
apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably
discontented when a woman does marry again, than when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does not; but
Sir Walter's continuing in singleness requires explanation. Be it
known then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, -LRB-having met with one
or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications-RRB-,
prided himself on remaining single for his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) dear daughters' sake. For
one daughter, his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) eldest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) would really have given up any thing,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had not been very much tempted to do. Elizabeth had
succeeded, at sixteen, to all that was possible, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother's rights
and consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
influence had always been great, and they had gone on together most
happily. His (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) two other children were of very inferior value. Mary had
acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming Mrs Charles
Musgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness of
character, which must have placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) high with any people of real
understanding, was nobody with either father or sister; her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) word had no
weight, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) convenience was always to give way--she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was only Anne.

<p/>To Lady Russell, indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was a most dear and highly valued
god-daughter, favourite, and friend. Lady Russell loved them all; but
it was only in Anne that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could fancy the mother to revive again.

<p/>A few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) father had
found little to admire in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), -LRB-so totally different were her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) delicate
features and mild dark eyes from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own-RRB-, there could be nothing in
them, now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was faded and thin, to excite his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) esteem. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
never indulged much hope, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had now none, of ever reading her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) name in
any other page of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) favourite work. All equality of alliance must
rest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely connected herself with an old
country family of respectability and large fortune, and had therefore
given all the honour and received none: Elizabeth would, one day or
other, marry suitably.

<p/>It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been
neither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely
any charm is lost. It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsome
Miss Elliot that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter
might be excused, therefore, in forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) age, or, at least, be
deemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming
as ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else; for he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
could plainly see how old all the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) family and acquaintance
were growing. Anne haggard, Mary coarse, every face in the
neighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow's foot about
Lady Russell's temples had long been a distress to him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>).

<p/>Elizabeth did not quite equal her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father in personal contentment.
Thirteen years had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and
directing with a self-possession and decision which could never have
given the idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) being younger than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was. For thirteen years
had she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at
home, and leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking
immediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and
dining-rooms in the country. Thirteen winters' revolving frosts had
seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood
afforded, and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) travelled
up to London with her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) father, for a few weeks' annual enjoyment of the
great world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had the remembrance of all this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had the
consciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) some regrets and
some apprehensions; she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was fully satisfied of being still quite as
handsome as ever, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) approach to the years of danger, and
would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by
baronet-blood within the next twelvemonth or two. Then might she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) again
take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) early youth,
but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) liked it not. Always to be presented with the date of her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>)
own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister,
made the book an evil; and more than once, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) father had left it
open on the table near her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>), had she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) closed it, with averted eyes, and
pushed it away.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book, and especially
the history of her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) own family, must ever present the remembrance of.
The heir presumptive, the very William Walter Elliot, Esq., whose
rights had been so generously supported by her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) father, had disappointed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had, while a very young girl, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had known him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to be,
in the event of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) having no brother, the future baronet, meant to
marry him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father had always meant that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had not
been known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot's death, Sir
Walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) overtures had not
been met with any warmth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had persevered in seeking it, making
allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of their
spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) first bloom, Mr
Elliot had been forced into the introduction.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the
law; and Elizabeth found him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) extremely agreeable, and every plan in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
favour was confirmed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was invited to Kellynch Hall; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was talked
of and expected all the rest of the year; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) never came. The
following spring he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was seen again in town, found equally agreeable,
again encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) did not come; and
the next tidings were that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was married. Instead of pushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of
inferior birth.

<p/>Sir Walter had resented it. As the head of the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man so
publicly by the hand; <div class="bookquote">``For they must have been seen together,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
observed, <div class="bookquote">``once at Tattersall's, and twice in the lobby of the House of
Commons.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) disapprobation was expressed, but apparently very little
regarded. Mr Elliot had attempted no apology, and shewn himself as
unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family, as Sir Walter
considered him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) unworthy of it: all acquaintance between them had
ceased.

<p/>This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval of
several years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man for
himself, and still more for being her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father's heir, and whose strong
family pride could see only in him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) a proper match for Sir Walter
Elliot's eldest daughter. There was not a baronet from A to Z whom her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal. Yet so
miserably had he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) conducted himself, that though she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was at this present
time -LRB-the summer of 1814-RRB- wearing black ribbons for his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) wife, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could
not admit him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) to be worth thinking of again. The disgrace of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) first
marriage might, perhaps, as there was no reason to suppose it
perpetuated by offspring, have been got over, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) not done worse;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had, as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends, they
had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully of them all, most
slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) belonged to, and
the honours which were hereafter to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) own. This could not be
pardoned.

<p/>Such were Elizabeth Elliot's sentiments and sensations; such the cares
to alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance, the
prosperity and the nothingness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) scene of life; such the feelings
to give interest to a long, uneventful residence in one country circle,
to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad, no
talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.

<p/>But now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be
added to these. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father was growing distressed for money. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
knew, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive the
heavy bills of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of Mr
Shepherd, his (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) agent, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) thoughts. The Kellynch property was
good, but not equal to Sir Walter's apprehension of the state required
in its possessor. While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method,
moderation, and economy, which had just kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) within his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) income; but
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
had been constantly exceeding it. It had not been possible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) to
spend less; he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was
imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was not only
growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often, that it
became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
daughter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) some hints of it the last spring in town;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had gone so far even as to say, <div class="bookquote">``Can we retrench? Does it occur to
you that there is any one article in which we can retrench?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and
Elizabeth, to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) justice, had, in the first ardour of female alarm,
set seriously to think what could be done, and had finally proposed
these two branches of economy, to cut off some unnecessary charities,
and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing-room; to which
expedients she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no
present down to Anne, as had been the usual yearly custom. But these
measures, however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real
extent of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged
to confess to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) soon afterwards. Elizabeth had nothing to propose of
deeper efficacy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt herself ill-used and unfortunate, as did her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
father; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of
lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity, or
relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.

<p/>There was only a small part of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) estate that Sir Walter could dispose
of; but had every acre been alienable, it would have made no
difference. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had condescended to mortgage as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had the
power, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) would never condescend to sell. No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) would never
disgrace his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) name so far. The Kellynch estate should be transmitted
whole and entire, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had received it.

<p/>Their two confidential friends, Mr Shepherd, who lived in the
neighbouring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise them;
and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be
struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and
reduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of any indulgence
of taste or pride.



<p/>Chapter 2


<p/>Mr Shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) hold
or his (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) views on Sir Walter, would rather have the disagreeable prompted
by anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint, and
only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent
judgement of Lady Russell, from whose known good sense he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) fully
expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) meant to see
finally adopted.

<p/>Lady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it
much serious consideration. She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was a woman rather of sound than of
quick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this
instance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was as desirous of saving Sir Walter's feelings, as solicitous
for the credit of the family, as aristocratic in her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) ideas of what was
due to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be. She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was a
benevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of strong attachments,
most correct in her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) conduct, strict in her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) notions of decorum, and with
manners that were held a standard of good-breeding. She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had a
cultivated mind, and was, generally speaking, rational and consistent;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had prejudices on the side of ancestry; she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had a value for
rank and consequence, which blinded her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) a little to the faults of those
who possessed them. Herself the widow of only a knight, she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) gave the
dignity of a baronet all its due; and Sir Walter, independent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
claims as an old acquaintance, an attentive neighbour, an obliging
landlord, the husband of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) very dear friend, the father of Anne and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sisters, was, as being Sir Walter, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) apprehension, entitled to
a great deal of compassion and consideration under his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) present
difficulties.

<p/>They must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was very
anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) and
Elizabeth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) drew up plans of economy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) made exact calculations,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did what nobody else thought of doing: she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) consulted Anne, who
never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the
question. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) in
marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to
Sir Walter. Every emendation of Anne's had been on the side of honesty
against importance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wanted more vigorous measures, a more complete
reformation, a quicker release from debt, a much higher tone of
indifference for everything but justice and equity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If we can persuade your father to all this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Russell</b></font>)</div>said Lady Russell,
looking over her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) paper, <div class="bookquote">``much may be done. If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will adopt these
regulations, in seven years he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will be clear; and I hope we may be able
to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and Elizabeth, that Kellynch Hall has a respectability
in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions; and that the
true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the
eyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle. What will
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families have
done, or ought to do? There will be nothing singular in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) case; and
it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering, as
it always does of our conduct. I have great hope of prevailing. We
must be serious and decided; for after all, the person who has
contracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to the
feelings of the gentleman, and the head of a house, like your father,
there is still more due to the character of an honest man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Russell</b></font>)</div><p/>This was the principle on which Anne wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father to be
proceeding, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) friends to be urging him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) considered it as an act
of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all
the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure,
and saw no dignity in anything short of it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wanted it to be
prescribed, and felt as a duty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) rated Lady Russell's influence
highly; and as to the severe degree of self-denial which her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own
conscience prompted, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) believed there might be little more difficulty
in persuading them to a complete, than to half a reformation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father and Elizabeth inclined her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to think that the
sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of
both, and so on, through the whole list of Lady Russell's too gentle
reductions.

<p/>How Anne's more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little
consequence. Lady Russell's had no success at all: could not be put up
with, were not to be borne. <div class="bookquote">``What! every comfort of life knocked off!
Journeys, London, servants, horses, table--contractions and
restrictions every where! To live no longer with the decencies even of
a private gentleman! No, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would sooner quit Kellynch Hall at once,
than remain in it on such disgraceful terms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quit Kellynch Hall.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Shepherd/Shepherd</b></font>)</div>The hint was immediately taken up by Mr
Shepherd, whose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter's
retrenching, and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done
without a change of abode. <div class="bookquote">``Since the idea had been started in the
very quarter which ought to dictate, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had no scruple,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``in
confessing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) judgement to be entirely on that side. It did not
appear to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that Sir Walter could materially alter his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) style of
living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient
dignity to support. In any other place Sir Walter might judge for
himself; and would be looked up to, as regulating the modes of life in
whatever way he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) might choose to model his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) household.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall; and after a very few days more of
doubt and indecision, the great question of whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) should go was
settled, and the first outline of this important change made out.

<p/>There had been three alternatives, London, Bath, or another house in
the country. All Anne's wishes had been for the latter. A small house
in their own neighbourhood, where they might still have Lady Russell's
society, still be near Mary, and still have the pleasure of sometimes
seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch, was the object of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
ambition. But the usual fate of Anne attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), in having something
very opposite from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) inclination fixed on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) disliked Bath, and
did not think it agreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>); and Bath was to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) home.

<p/>Sir Walter had at first thought more of London; but Mr Shepherd felt
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) could not be trusted in London, and had been skilful enough to
dissuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) from it, and make Bath preferred. It was a much safer
place for a gentleman in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) predicament: he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might there be important
at comparatively little expense. Two material advantages of Bath over
London had of course been given all their weight: its more convenient
distance from Kellynch, only fifty miles, and Lady Russell's spending
some part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction of
Lady Russell, whose first views on the projected change had been for
Bath, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that they should
lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.

<p/>Lady Russell felt obliged to oppose her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) dear Anne's known wishes. It
would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) own neighbourhood. Anne herself would have found the
mortifications of it more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) foresaw, and to Sir Walter's
feelings they must have been dreadful. And with regard to Anne's
dislike of Bath, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising,
first, from the circumstance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) having been three years at school
there, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother's death; and secondly, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) happening to be
not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had afterwards
spent there with herself.

<p/>Lady Russell was fond of Bath, in short, and disposed to think it must
suit them all; and as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) young friend's health, by passing all the
warm months with her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) at Kellynch Lodge, every danger would be avoided;
and it was in fact, a change which must do both health and spirits
good. Anne had been too little from home, too little seen. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) spirits
were not high. A larger society would improve them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to
be more known.

<p/>The undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for
Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part, and a very
material part of the scheme, which had been happily engrafted on the
beginning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was not only to quit his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) home, but to see it in the
hands of others; a trial of fortitude, which stronger heads than Sir
Walter's have found too much. Kellynch Hall was to be let. This,
however, was a profound secret, not to be breathed beyond their own
circle.

<p/>Sir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to
design letting his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) house. Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word
<div class="bookquote">``advertise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Shepherd/Shepherd</b></font>)</div>but never dared approach it again. Sir Walter spurned the
idea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint
being dropped of his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) having such an intention; and it was only on the
supposition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) being spontaneously solicited by some most
unexceptionable applicant, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) own terms, and as a great favour,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) would let it at all.

<p/>How quick come the reasons for approving what we like! Lady Russell
had another excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that Sir
Walter and his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) family were to remove from the country. Elizabeth had
been lately forming an intimacy, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wished to see interrupted.
It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd, who had returned, after an
unprosperous marriage, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father's house, with the additional
burden of two children. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was a clever young woman, who understood
the art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least, at Kellynch Hall;
and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot, as to have been
already staying there more than once, in spite of all that Lady
Russell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place, could hint of
caution and reserve.

<p/>Lady Russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth, and
seemed to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>), rather because she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) would love her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>), than because
Elizabeth deserved it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had never received from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) more than
outward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance; had
never succeeded in any point which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wanted to carry, against
previous inclination. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had been repeatedly very earnest in trying
to get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open to all the
injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth
the advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own better judgement and experience; but always in
vain: Elizabeth would go her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own way; and never had she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) pursued it in
more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs
Clay; turning from the society of so deserving a sister, to bestow her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
but the object of distant civility.

<p/>From situation, Mrs Clay was, in Lady Russell's estimate, a very
unequal, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) character she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) believed a very dangerous companion;
and a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind, and bring a choice of
more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot's reach, was therefore an
object of first-rate importance.



<p/>Chapter 3


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must take leave to observe, Sir Walter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr</b></font>)</div>said Mr Shepherd one
morning at Kellynch Hall, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) laid down the newspaper, <div class="bookquote">``that the
present juncture is much in our favour. This peace will be turning all
our rich naval officers ashore. They will be all wanting a home.
Could not be a better time, Sir Walter, for having a choice of tenants,
very responsible tenants. Many a noble fortune has been made during
the war. If a rich admiral were to come in our way, Sir Walter--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) would be a very lucky man, Shepherd,''  (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div>replied Sir Walter; <div class="bookquote">``that's
all I have to remark. A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall be to him (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>);
rather the greatest prize of all, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) have taken ever so many
before; hey, Shepherd?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Shepherd laughed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) must, at this wit, and then added--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I presume to observe, Sir Walter, that, in the way of business,
gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with. I have had a little
knowledge of their methods of doing business; and I am free to confess
that they have very liberal notions, and are as likely to make
desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with.
Therefore, Sir Walter, what I would take leave to suggest is, that if
in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention; which
must be contemplated as a possible thing, because we know how difficult
it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the
notice and curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; I, John
Shepherd, might conceal any family-matters that I chose, for nobody
would think it worth their while to observe me; but Sir Walter Elliot
has eyes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) which it may be very difficult to elude; and
therefore, thus much I venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise
me if, with all our caution, some rumour of the truth should get
abroad; in the supposition of which, as I was going to observe, since
applications will unquestionably follow, I should think any from our
wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leave
to add, that two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you the
trouble of replying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Walter only nodded. But soon afterwards, rising and pacing the
room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) observed sarcastically--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are few among the gentlemen of the navy, I imagine, who would
not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They would look around them, no doubt, and bless their good fortune,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Clay</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Clay, for Mrs Clay was present: her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) father had driven her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>)
over, nothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay's health as a drive to
Kellynch: <div class="bookquote">``but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might
be a very desirable tenant. I have known a good deal of the
profession; and besides their liberality, they are so neat and careful
in all their ways! These valuable pictures of yours, Sir Walter, if
you chose to leave them, would be perfectly safe. Everything in and
about the house would be taken such excellent care of! The gardens and
shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now. You
need not be afraid, Miss Elliot, of your own sweet flower gardens being
neglected.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Clay</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As to all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div>rejoined Sir Walter coolly, <div class="bookquote">``supposing I were induced
to let my house, I have by no means made up my mind as to the
privileges to be annexed to it. I am not particularly disposed to
favour a tenant. The park would be open to him (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) of course, and few navy
officers, or men of any other description, can have had such a range;
but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the
pleasure-grounds, is another thing. I am not fond of the idea of my
shrubberies being always approachable; and I should recommend Miss
Elliot to be on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) guard with respect to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) flower garden. I am very
little disposed to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary
favour, I assure you, be he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) sailor or soldier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>After a short pause, Mr Shepherd presumed to say--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In all these cases, there are established usages which make everything
plain and easy between landlord and tenant. Your interest, Sir Walter,
is in pretty safe hands. Depend upon me for taking care that no tenant
has more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) just rights. I venture to hint, that Sir Walter
Elliot cannot be half so jealous for his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) own, as John Shepherd will be
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Shepherd/Shepherd</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Anne spoke--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The navy, I think, who have done so much for us, have at least an
equal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and all the
privileges which any home can give. Sailors work hard enough for their
comforts, we must all allow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true, very true. What Miss Anne says, is very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Shepherd/Shepherd</b></font>)</div>was Mr
Shepherd's rejoinder, and <div class="bookquote">``Oh! certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Shepherd/Shepherd</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) daughter's; but Sir
Walter's remark was, soon afterwards--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The profession has its utility, but I should be sorry to see any
friend of mine belonging to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the reply, and with a look of surprise.

<p/>``Yes; it is in two points offensive to me; I have two strong grounds of
objection to it. First, as being the means of bringing persons of
obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours which
their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly, as it
cuts up a man's youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old
sooner than any other man. I have observed it all my life. A man is
in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one
whose father, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father might have disdained to speak to, and of
becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in any other
line. One day last spring, in town, I was in company with two men,
striking instances of what I am talking of; Lord St Ives, whose father
we all know to have been a country curate, without bread to eat; I was
to give place to Lord St Ives, and a certain Admiral Baldwin, the most
deplorable-looking personage you can imagine; his (<font color='blue'><b>Baldwin</b></font>) face the colour of
mahogany, rough and rugged to the last degree; all lines and wrinkles,
nine grey hairs of a side, and nothing but a dab of powder at top. ``In
the name of heaven, who is that old fellow?'' said I to a friend of mine
who was standing near, -LRB-Sir Basil Morley-RRB-. ``Old fellow!<div class="bookquote">'' cried Sir
Basil, `it is Admiral Baldwin. What do you take his (<font color='blue'><b>Baldwin</b></font>) age to be?''
 (<font color='red'><b>fellow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sixty,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, `or perhaps sixty-two.'' ``Forty,<div class="bookquote">'' replied Sir Basil,
`forty, and no more.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Picture to yourselves my amazement; I shall not
easily forget Admiral Baldwin. I never saw quite so wretched an
example of what a sea-faring life can do; but to a degree, I know it is
the same with them all: they are all knocked about, and exposed to
every climate, and every weather, till they are not fit to be seen. It
is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once, before they reach
Admiral Baldwin's age.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Sir Walter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Clay</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Clay, <div class="bookquote">``this is being severe indeed. Have
a little mercy on the poor men. We are not all born to be handsome.
The sea is no beautifier, certainly; sailors do grow old betimes; I
have observed it; they soon lose the look of youth. But then, is not
it the same with many other professions, perhaps most other? Soldiers,
in active service, are not at all better off: and even in the quieter
professions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind, if not of the
body, which seldom leaves a man's looks to the natural effect of time.
The lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician is up at all hours,
and travelling in all weather; and even the clergyman--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Clay</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) stopt a
moment to consider what might do for the clergyman;--<div class="bookquote">``and even the
clergyman, you know is obliged to go into infected rooms, and expose
his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere. In
fact, as I have long been convinced, though every profession is
necessary and honourable in its turn, it is only the lot of those who
are not obliged to follow any, who can live in a regular way, in the
country, choosing their own hours, following their own pursuits, and
living on their own property, without the torment of trying for more;
it is only their lot, I say, to hold the blessings of health and a good
appearance to the utmost: I know no other set of men but what lose
something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div><p/>It seemed as if Mr Shepherd, in this anxiety to bespeak Sir Walter's
good will towards a naval officer as tenant, had been gifted with
foresight; for the very first application for the house was from an
Admiral Croft, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) shortly afterwards fell into company in
attending the quarter sessions at Taunton; and indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) had received
a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent. By the report which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) hastened over to Kellynch to make, Admiral Croft was a native of
Somersetshire, who having acquired a very handsome fortune, was wishing
to settle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) own country, and had come down to Taunton in order to
look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood, which,
however, had not suited him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>); that accidentally hearing---LRB-it was just as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) had foretold, Mr Shepherd observed, Sir Walter's concerns could not
be kept a secret,-RRB---accidentally hearing of the possibility of
Kellynch Hall being to let, and understanding his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) -LRB-Mr Shepherd's-RRB-
connection with the owner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) had introduced himself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) in order to
make particular inquiries, and had, in the course of a pretty long
conference, expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man
who knew it only by description could feel; and given Mr Shepherd, in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) explicit account of himself, every proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) being a most
responsible, eligible tenant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And who is Admiral Croft?''  (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div>was Sir Walter's cold suspicious inquiry.

<p/>Mr Shepherd answered for his (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) being of a gentleman's family, and
mentioned a place; and Anne, after the little pause which followed,
added--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) is a rear admiral of the white. He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) was in the Trafalgar action,
and has been in the East Indies since; he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) was stationed there, I
believe, several years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I take it for granted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div>observed Sir Walter, <div class="bookquote">``that his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) face is
about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>), that Admiral Croft was a very hale,
hearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure, but not
much, and quite the gentleman in all his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) notions and behaviour; not
likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted a
comfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible; knew he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) must
pay for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished house of that
consequence might fetch; should not have been surprised if Sir Walter
had asked more; had inquired about the manor; would be glad of the
deputation, certainly, but made no great point of it; said he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) sometimes
took out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman.

<p/>Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all the
circumstances of the Admiral's family, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) peculiarly
desirable as a tenant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) was a married man, and without children; the
very state to be wished for. A house was never taken good care of, Mr
Shepherd observed, without a lady: he (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) did not know, whether furniture
might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady, as
where there were many children. A lady, without a family, was the very
best preserver of furniture in the world. He (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) had seen Mrs Croft, too;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) was at Taunton with the admiral, and had been present almost all
the time they were talking the matter over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And a very well-spoken, genteel, shrewd lady, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seemed to be,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>continued he (<font color='blue'><b>admiral</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``asked more questions about the house, and terms, and
taxes, than the Admiral himself, and seemed more conversant with
business; and moreover, Sir Walter, I found she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not quite
unconnected in this country, any more than her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband; that is to say,
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told me
so herself: sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at
Monkford. Bless me! what was his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) name? At this moment I cannot
recollect his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) name, though I have heard it so lately. Penelope, my
dear, can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at
Monkford: Mrs Croft's brother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mrs Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) did not
hear the appeal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no conception whom you can mean, Shepherd; I remember no
gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless me! how very odd! I shall forget my own name soon, I suppose.
A name that I am so very well acquainted with; knew the gentleman so
well by sight; seen him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) a hundred times; came to consult me once, I
remember, about a trespass of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) neighbours; farmer's man
breaking into his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) orchard; wall torn down; apples stolen; caught in the
fact; and afterwards, contrary to my judgement, submitted to an
amicable compromise. Very odd indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>After waiting another moment--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean Mr Wentworth, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/>Mr Shepherd was all gratitude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wentworth was the very name! Mr Wentworth was the very man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had
the curacy of Monkford, you know, Sir Walter, some time back, for two
or three years. Came there about the year --5, I take it. You
remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>), I am sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wentworth? Oh! ay,--Mr Wentworth, the curate of Monkford. You misled
me by the term gentleman. I thought you were speaking of some man of
property: Mr Wentworth was nobody, I remember; quite unconnected;
nothing to do with the Strafford family. One wonders how the names of
many of our nobility become so common.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Shepherd/Shepherd</b></font>)</div><p/>As Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them no
service with Sir Walter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) mentioned it no more; returning, with all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) zeal, to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their
favour; their age, and number, and fortune; the high idea they had
formed of Kellynch Hall, and extreme solicitude for the advantage of
renting it; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the
happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot: an extraordinary
taste, certainly, could they have been supposed in the secret of Sir
Walter's estimate of the dues of a tenant.

<p/>It succeeded, however; and though Sir Walter must ever look with an
evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house, and think them
infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest
terms, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the
treaty, and authorising him (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) to wait on Admiral Croft, who still
remained at Taunton, and fix a day for the house being seen.

<p/>Sir Walter was not very wise; but still he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had experience enough of the
world to feel, that a more unobjectionable tenant, in all essentials,
than Admiral Croft bid fair to be, could hardly offer. So far went his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>)
understanding; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) vanity supplied a little additional soothing, in
the Admiral's situation in life, which was just high enough, and not
too high. <div class="bookquote">``I have let my house to Admiral Croft,''  (<font color='red'><b>any Mr Mr</b></font>)</div>would sound
extremely well; very much better than to any mere Mr--; a Mr -LRB-save,
perhaps, some half dozen in the nation,-RRB- always needs a note of
explanation. An admiral speaks his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) own consequence, and, at the same
time, can never make a baronet look small. In all their dealings and
intercourse, Sir Walter Elliot must ever have the precedence.

<p/>Nothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth: but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
inclination was growing so strong for a removal, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was happy to
have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand; and not a word to
suspend decision was uttered by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).

<p/>Mr Shepherd was completely empowered to act; and no sooner had such an
end been reached, than Anne, who had been a most attentive listener to
the whole, left the room, to seek the comfort of cool air for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
flushed cheeks; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) walked along a favourite grove, said, with a
gentle sigh, <div class="bookquote">``A few months more, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>), perhaps, may be walking here.''



 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 4


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) was not Mr Wentworth, the former curate of Monkford, however
suspicious appearances may be, but a Captain Frederick Wentworth, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
brother, who being made commander in consequence of the action off St
Domingo, and not immediately employed, had come into Somersetshire, in
the summer of 1806; and having no parent living, found a home for half
a year at Monkford. He (<font color='blue'><b>Domingo</b></font>) was, at that time, a remarkably fine young man,
with a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy; and Anne an
extremely pretty girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste, and feeling.
Half the sum of attraction, on either side, might have been enough, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Domingo</b></font>) had nothing to do, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had hardly anybody to love; but the
encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail. They were
gradually acquainted, and when acquainted, rapidly and deeply in love.
It would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the
other, or which had been the happiest: she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), in receiving his (<font color='blue'><b>Domingo</b></font>)
declarations and proposals, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Domingo</b></font>) in having them accepted.

<p/>A short period of exquisite felicity followed, and but a short one.
Troubles soon arose. Sir Walter, on being applied to, without actually
withholding his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) consent, or saying it should never be, gave it all the
negative of great astonishment, great coldness, great silence, and a
professed resolution of doing nothing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) daughter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) thought it
a very degrading alliance; and Lady Russell, though with more tempered
and pardonable pride, received it as a most unfortunate one.

<p/>Anne Elliot, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) claims of birth, beauty, and mind, to throw
herself away at nineteen; involve herself at nineteen in an engagement
with a young man, who had nothing but himself to recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and no
hopes of attaining affluence, but in the chances of a most uncertain
profession, and no connexions to secure even his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) farther rise in the
profession, would be, indeed, a throwing away, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) grieved to
think of! Anne Elliot, so young; known to so few, to be snatched off
by a stranger without alliance or fortune; or rather sunk by him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) into a
state of most wearing, anxious, youth-killing dependence! It must not
be, if by any fair interference of friendship, any representations from
one who had almost a mother's love, and mother's rights, it would be
prevented.

<p/>Captain Wentworth had no fortune. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had been lucky in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) profession;
but spending freely, what had come freely, had realized nothing. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was confident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) should soon be rich: full of life and ardour,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) should soon have a ship, and soon be on a station that
would lead to everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) wanted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had always been lucky; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) knew
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) should be so still. Such confidence, powerful in its own warmth,
and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it, must have been
enough for Anne; but Lady Russell saw it very differently. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
sanguine temper, and fearlessness of mind, operated very differently on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) saw in it but an aggravation of the evil. It only added a
dangerous character to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was brilliant, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was headstrong.
Lady Russell had little taste for wit, and of anything approaching to
imprudence a horror. She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) deprecated the connexion in every light.

<p/>Such opposition, as these feelings produced, was more than Anne could
combat. Young and gentle as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was, it might yet have been possible
to withstand her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father's ill-will, though unsoftened by one kind word
or look on the part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sister; but Lady Russell, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had
always loved and relied on, could not, with such steadiness of opinion,
and such tenderness of manner, be continually advising her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) in vain.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing: indiscreet,
improper, hardly capable of success, and not deserving it. But it was
not a merely selfish caution, under which she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) acted, in putting an end
to it. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) not imagined herself consulting his (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) good, even more
than her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) own, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) could hardly have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) up. The belief of being
prudent, and self-denying, principally for his (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) advantage, was her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) chief
consolation, under the misery of a parting, a final parting; and every
consolation was required, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had to encounter all the additional
pain of opinions, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) side, totally unconvinced and unbending, and
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had
left the country in consequence.

<p/>A few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance;
but not with a few months ended Anne's share of suffering from it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
attachment and regrets had, for a long time, clouded every enjoyment of
youth, and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting
effect.

<p/>More than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful
interest had reached its close; and time had softened down much,
perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been too
dependent on time alone; no aid had been given in change of place
-LRB-except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture-RRB-, or in any novelty
or enlargement of society. No one had ever come within the Kellynch
circle, who could bear a comparison with Frederick Wentworth, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
stood in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) memory. No second attachment, the only thoroughly
natural, happy, and sufficient cure, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) time of life, had been
possible to the nice tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mind, the fastidiousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) taste,
in the small limits of the society around them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been
solicited, when about two-and-twenty, to change her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) name, by the young
man, who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) younger
sister; and Lady Russell had lamented her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) refusal; for Charles Musgrove
was the eldest son of a man, whose landed property and general
importance were second in that country, only to Sir Walter's, and of
good character and appearance; and however Lady Russell might have
asked yet for something more, while Anne was nineteen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would have
rejoiced to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) at twenty-two so respectably removed from the
partialities and injustice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father's house, and settled so
permanently near herself. But in this case, Anne had left nothing for
advice to do; and though Lady Russell, as satisfied as ever with her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>)
own discretion, never wished the past undone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) began now to have the
anxiety which borders on hopelessness for Anne's being tempted, by some
man of talents and independence, to enter a state for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) held
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to be peculiarly fitted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) warm affections and domestic habits.

<p/>They knew not each other's opinion, either its constancy or its change,
on the one leading point of Anne's conduct, for the subject was never
alluded to; but Anne, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently
from what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been made to think at nineteen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not blame
Lady Russell, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) did not blame herself for having been guided by her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>);
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances, to
apply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) for counsel, they would never receive any of such certain
immediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good. She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was persuaded
that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home, and every
anxiety attending his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) profession, all their probable fears, delays, and
disappointments, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) should yet have been a happier woman in
maintaining the engagement, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had been in the sacrifice of it;
and this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than
the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs,
without reference to the actual results of their case, which, as it
happened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be
reasonably calculated on. All his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) sanguine expectations, all his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>)
confidence had been justified. His (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) genius and ardour had seemed to
foresee and to command his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) prosperous path. He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) had, very soon after
their engagement ceased, got employ: and all that he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) would
follow, had taken place. He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) had distinguished himself, and early
gained the other step in rank, and must now, by successive captures,
have made a handsome fortune. She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had only navy lists and newspapers
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) authority, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) could not doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) being rich; and, in
favour of his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) constancy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had no reason to believe him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) married.

<p/>How eloquent could Anne Elliot have been! how eloquent, at least, were
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful
confidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which seems
to insult exertion and distrust Providence! She (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had been forced into
prudence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) youth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) learned romance as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) grew older: the
natural sequel of an unnatural beginning.

<p/>With all these circumstances, recollections and feelings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) could not
hear that Captain Wentworth's sister was likely to live at Kellynch
without a revival of former pain; and many a stroll, and many a sigh,
were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) often told
herself it was folly, before she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could harden her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) nerves sufficiently
to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts and their business no
evil. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was assisted, however, by that perfect indifference and
apparent unconsciousness, among the only three of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own friends in
the secret of the past, which seemed almost to deny any recollection of
it. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could do justice to the superiority of Lady Russell's motives
in this, over those of her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) father and Elizabeth; she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) could honour all
the better feelings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) calmness; but the general air of oblivion
among them was highly important from whatever it sprung; and in the
event of Admiral Croft's really taking Kellynch Hall, she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) rejoiced anew
over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>), of the
past being known to those three only among her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) connexions, by whom no
syllable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that
among his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>), the brother only with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) had been residing, had
received any information of their short-lived engagement. That brother
had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man, and,
moreover, a single man at the time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) had a fond dependence on no
human creature's having heard of it from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>The sister, Mrs Croft, had then been out of England, accompanying her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>)
husband on a foreign station, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) own sister, Mary, had been at
school while it all occurred; and never admitted by the pride of some,
and the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards.

<p/>With these supports, she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) hoped that the acquaintance between herself
and the Crofts, which, with Lady Russell, still resident in Kellynch,
and Mary fixed only three miles off, must be anticipated, need not
involve any particular awkwardness.



<p/>Chapter 5


<p/>On the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft's seeing Kellynch
Hall, Anne found it most natural to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) almost daily walk to Lady
Russell's, and keep out of the way till all was over; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) found it
most natural to be sorry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had missed the opportunity of seeing
them.

<p/>This meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory, and decided
the whole business at once. Each lady was previously well disposed for
an agreement, and saw nothing, therefore, but good manners in the
other; and with regard to the gentlemen, there was such an hearty good
humour, such an open, trusting liberality on the Admiral's side, as
could not but influence Sir Walter, who had besides been flattered into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) very best and most polished behaviour by Mr Shepherd's assurances
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) being known, by report, to the Admiral, as a model of good
breeding.

<p/>The house and grounds, and furniture, were approved, the Crofts were
approved, terms, time, every thing, and every body, was right; and Mr
Shepherd's clerks were set to work, without there having been a single
preliminary difference to modify of all that <div class="bookquote">``This indenture sheweth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Shepherd clerks</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Walter, without hesitation, declared the Admiral to be the
best-looking sailor he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had ever met with, and went so far as to say,
that if his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) own man might have had the arranging of his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) hair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) should
not be ashamed of being seen with him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) any where; and the Admiral, with
sympathetic cordiality, observed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) wife as they drove back through
the park, <div class="bookquote">``I thought we should soon come to a deal, my dear, in spite
of what they told us at Taunton. The Baronet will never set the Thames
on fire, but there seems to be no harm in him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>).'' (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>--reciprocal
compliments, which would have been esteemed about equal.

<p/>The Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas; and as Sir Walter
proposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month, there
was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement.

<p/>Lady Russell, convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any
use, or any importance, in the choice of the house which they were
going to secure, was very unwilling to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hurried away so soon,
and wanted to make it possible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to stay behind till she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) might
convey her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to Bath herself after Christmas; but having engagements of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own which must take her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) from Kellynch for several weeks, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was
unable to give the full invitation she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wished, and Anne though dreading
the possible heats of September in all the white glare of Bath, and
grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the
autumnal months in the country, did not think that, everything
considered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wished to remain. It would be most right, and most
wise, and, therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others.

<p/>Something occurred, however, to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) a different duty. Mary, often
a little unwell, and always thinking a great deal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own
complaints, and always in the habit of claiming Anne when anything was
the matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) should not have a
day's health all the autumn, entreated, or rather required her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), for it
was hardly entreaty, to come to Uppercross Cottage, and bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
company as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) should want her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), instead of going to Bath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot possibly do without Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>was Mary's reasoning; and
Elizabeth's reply was, <div class="bookquote">``Then I am sure Anne had better stay, for nobody
will want her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in Bath.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>To be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least
better than being rejected as no good at all; and Anne, glad to be
thought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty, and
certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own
dear country, readily agreed to stay.

<p/>This invitation of Mary's removed all Lady Russell's difficulties, and
it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath till
Lady Russell took her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>), and that all the intervening time should be
divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge.

<p/>So far all was perfectly right; but Lady Russell was almost startled by
the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan, when it burst on her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>),
which was, Mrs Clay's being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter and
Elizabeth, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in
all the business before her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). Lady Russell was extremely sorry that
such a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered, grieved,
and feared; and the affront it contained to Anne, in Mrs Clay's being
of so much use, while Anne could be of none, was a very sore
aggravation.

<p/>Anne herself was become hardened to such affronts; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt the
imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell. With a
great deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) often
wished less, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) father's character, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was sensible that results
the most serious to his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) family from the intimacy were more than
possible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) did not imagine that her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) father had at present an idea
of the kind. Mrs Clay had freckles, and a projecting tooth, and a
clumsy wrist, which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was continually making severe remarks upon, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) absence; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) was young, and certainly altogether well-looking,
and possessed, in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners,
infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might
have been. Anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had little hope of success; but Elizabeth, who in the
event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than
herself, should never, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thought, have reason to reproach her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) for
giving no warning.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spoke, and seemed only to offend. Elizabeth could not conceive how
such an absurd suspicion should occur to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and indignantly answered
for each party's perfectly knowing their situation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs Clay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), warmly, <div class="bookquote">``never forgets who she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) is; and as I am
rather better acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) sentiments than you can be, I can
assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly
nice, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more
strongly than most people. And as to my father, I really should not
have thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), who has kept himself single so long for our
sakes, need be suspected now. If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman,
I grant you, it might be wrong to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) so much with me; not that
anything in the world, I am sure, would induce my father to make a
degrading match, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might be rendered unhappy. But poor Mrs Clay
who, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) merits, can never have been reckoned tolerably
pretty, I really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect
safety. One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>)
personal misfortunes, though I know you must fifty times. That tooth
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>)'s and those freckles. Freckles do not disgust me so very much
as they do him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I have known a face not materially disfigured by a
few, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) abominates them. You must have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) notice Mrs Clay's
freckles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is hardly any personal defect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>replied Anne, <div class="bookquote">``which an
agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think very differently,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>answered Elizabeth, shortly; <div class="bookquote">``an agreeable
manner may set off handsome features, but can never alter plain ones.
However, at any rate, as I have a great deal more at stake on this
point than anybody else can have, I think it rather unnecessary in you
to be advising me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless of
doing good. Elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion, might yet be
made observant by it.

<p/>The last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw Sir Walter,
Miss Elliot, and Mrs Clay to Bath. The party drove off in very good
spirits; Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the
afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show
themselves, and Anne walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolate
tranquillity, to the Lodge, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was to spend the first week.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend was not in better spirits than herself. Lady Russell felt
this break-up of the family exceedingly. Their respectability was as
dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) own, and a daily intercourse had become precious by
habit. It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds, and still
worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into; and to escape
the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village, and be out
of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived, she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) had determined
to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) own absence from home begin when she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) must give up Anne.
Accordingly their removal was made together, and Anne was set down at
Uppercross Cottage, in the first stage of Lady Russell's journey.

<p/>Uppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back had
been completely in the old English style, containing only two houses
superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers; the
mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees,
substantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage,
enclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree trained
round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young `squire, it had
received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage, for
his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda, French
windows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch the
traveller's eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and
premises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile farther on.

<p/>Here Anne had often been staying. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew the ways of Uppercross as
well as those of Kellynch. The two families were so continually
meeting, so much in the habit of running in and out of each other's
house at all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to find Mary
alone; but being alone, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) being unwell and out of spirits was almost
a matter of course. Though better endowed than the elder sister, Mary
had not Anne's understanding nor temper. While well, and happy, and
properly attended to, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had great good humour and excellent spirits;
but any indisposition sunk her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) completely. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had no resources for
solitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot
self-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress that of
fancying herself neglected and ill-used. In person, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was inferior to
both sisters, and had, even in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) bloom, only reached the dignity of
being <div class="bookquote">``a fine girl.''  (<font color='red'><b>both sisters</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty
little drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which had been
gradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers and two
children; and, on Anne's appearing, greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) with--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, you are come at last! I began to think I should never see you. I
am so ill I can hardly speak. I have not seen a creature the whole
morning!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to find you unwell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>replied Anne. <div class="bookquote">``You sent me such a
good account of yourself on Thursday!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I made the best of it; I always do: but I was very far from well
at the time; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life as I have
been all this morning: very unfit to be left alone, I am sure.
Suppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way, and not
able to ring the bell! So, Lady Russell would not get out. I do not
think she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) has been in this house three times this summer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne said what was proper, and enquired after her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) husband. <div class="bookquote">``Oh!
Charles is out shooting. I have not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) since seven o'clock. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
would go, though I told him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) how ill I was. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) should not stay
out long; but he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has never come back, and now it is almost one. I
assure you, I have not seen a soul this whole long morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have had your little boys with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, as long as I could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageable
that they do me more harm than good. Little Charles does not mind a
word I say, and Walter is growing quite as bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you will soon be better now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>replied Anne, cheerfully. <div class="bookquote">``You
know I always cure you when I come. How are your neighbours at the
Great House?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can give you no account of them. I have not seen one of them
to-day, except Mr Musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the
window, but without getting off his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) horse; and though I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) how
ill I was, not one of them have been near me. It did not happen to
suit the Miss Musgroves, I suppose, and they never put themselves out
of their way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone. It is
early.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never want them, I assure you. They talk and laugh a great deal too
much for me. Oh! Anne, I am so very unwell! It was quite unkind of
you not to come on Thursday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Mary, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of
yourself! You wrote in the cheerfullest manner, and said you were
perfectly well, and in no hurry for me; and that being the case, you
must be aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the
last: and besides what I felt on her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) account, I have really been so
busy, have had so much to do, that I could not very conveniently have
left Kellynch sooner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me! what can you possibly have to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A great many things, I assure you. More than I can recollect in a
moment; but I can tell you some. I have been making a duplicate of the
catalogue of my father's books and pictures. I have been several times
in the garden with Mackenzie, trying to understand, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Mackenzie</b></font>)
understand, which of Elizabeth's plants are for Lady Russell. I have
had all my own little concerns to arrange, books and music to divide,
and all my trunks to repack, from not having understood in time what
was intended as to the waggons: and one thing I have had to do, Mary,
of a more trying nature: going to almost every house in the parish, as
a sort of take-leave. I was told that they wished it. But all these
things took up a great deal of time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! well!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and after a moment's pause, <div class="bookquote">``but you have never asked me
one word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you go then? I have made no enquiries, because I concluded you
must have been obliged to give up the party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes! I went. I was very well yesterday; nothing at all the matter
with me till this morning. It would have been strange if I had not
gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad you were well enough, and I hope you had a pleasant
party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing remarkable. One always knows beforehand what the dinner will
be, and who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a
carriage of one's own. Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me, and we were so
crowded! They are both so very large, and take up so much room; and Mr
Musgrove always sits forward. So, there was I, crowded into the back
seat with Henrietta and Louisa; and I think it very likely that my
illness to-day may be owing to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>A little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on
Anne's side produced nearly a cure on Mary's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could soon sit
upright on the sofa, and began to hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) might be able to leave it by
dinner-time. Then, forgetting to think of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was at the other end
of the room, beautifying a nosegay; then, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ate her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cold meat; and
then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was well enough to propose a little walk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where shall we go?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), when they were ready. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you
will not like to call at the Great House before they have been to see
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not the smallest objection on that account,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>replied Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I
should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know so
well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible. They ought
to feel what is due to you as my sister. However, we may as well go
and sit with them a little while, and when we have that over, we can
enjoy our walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that,
though there were on each side continual subjects of offence, neither
family could now do without it. To the Great House accordingly they
went, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour,
with a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present daughters
of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a
grand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables placed in
every direction. Oh! could the originals of the portraits against the
wainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue
satin have seen what was going on, have been conscious of such an
overthrow of all order and neatness! The portraits themselves seemed
to be staring in astonishment.

<p/>The Musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration,
perhaps of improvement. The father and mother were in the old English
style, and the young people in the new. Mr and Mrs Musgrove were a
very good sort of people; friendly and hospitable, not much educated,
and not at all elegant. Their children had more modern minds and
manners. There was a numerous family; but the only two grown up,
excepting Charles, were Henrietta and Louisa, young ladies of nineteen
and twenty, who had brought from school at Exeter all the usual stock
of accomplishments, and were now like thousands of other young ladies,
living to be fashionable, happy, and merry. Their dress had every
advantage, their faces were rather pretty, their spirits extremely
good, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant; they were of consequence
at home, and favourites abroad. Anne always contemplated them as some
of the happiest creatures of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) acquaintance; but still, saved as we
all are, by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for
the possibility of exchange, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would not have given up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own more
elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them
nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement
together, that good-humoured mutual affection, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had known
so little herself with either of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sisters.

<p/>They were received with great cordiality. Nothing seemed amiss on the
side of the Great House family, which was generally, as Anne very well
knew, the least to blame. The half hour was chatted away pleasantly
enough; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was not at all surprised, at the end of it, to have
their walking party joined by both the Miss Musgroves, at Mary's
particular invitation.



<p/>Chapter 6


<p/>Anne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross, to learn that a removal
from one set of people to another, though at a distance of only three
miles, will often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and
idea. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had never been staying there before, without being struck by
it, or without wishing that other Elliots could have her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) advantage in
seeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs which at
Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading
interest; yet, with all this experience, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must now
submit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing our own
nothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>); for
certainly, coming as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did, with a heart full of the subject which
had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found in
the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove: <div class="bookquote">``So, Miss
Anne, Sir Walter and your sister are gone; and what part of Bath do you
think they will settle in?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>and this, without much waiting for an
answer; or in the young ladies' addition of, <div class="bookquote">``I hope we shall be in
Bath in the winter; but remember, papa, if we do go, we must be in a
good situation: none of your Queen Squares for us!''  (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>or in the anxious
supplement from Mary, of--<div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, I shall be pretty well off,
when you are all gone away to be happy at Bath!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future, and think
with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one
such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell.

<p/>The Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy, their own
horses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females were fully
occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping, neighbours,
dress, dancing, and music. She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) acknowledged it to be very fitting,
that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of
discourse; and hoped, ere long, to become a not unworthy member of the
one she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was now transplanted into. With the prospect of spending at
least two months at Uppercross, it was highly incumbent on her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) to
clothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) imagination, her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) memory, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) ideas in as much of
Uppercross as possible.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had no dread of these two months. Mary was not so repulsive and
unsisterly as Elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers;
neither was there anything among the other component parts of the
cottage inimical to comfort. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was always on friendly terms with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) nearly as well, and
respected her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a great deal more than their mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had an object of
interest, amusement, and wholesome exertion.

<p/>Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) was
undoubtedly superior to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) wife, but not of powers, or conversation,
or grace, to make the past, as they were connected together, at all a
dangerous contemplation; though, at the same time, Anne could believe,
with Lady Russell, that a more equal match might have greatly improved
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>); and that a woman of real understanding might have given more
consequence to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) character, and more usefulness, rationality, and
elegance to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) habits and pursuits. As it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) did nothing with
much zeal, but sport; and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) time was otherwise trifled away, without
benefit from books or anything else. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) had very good spirits, which
never seemed much affected by his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) wife's occasional lowness, bore with
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) unreasonableness sometimes to Anne's admiration, and upon the
whole, though there was very often a little disagreement -LRB-in which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
had sometimes more share than she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wished, being appealed to by both
parties-RRB-, they might pass for a happy couple. They were always
perfectly agreed in the want of more money, and a strong inclination
for a handsome present from his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) father; but here, as on most topics, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>)
had the superiority, for while Mary thought it a great shame that such
a present was not made, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) always contended for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) father's having
many other uses for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) money, and a right to spend it as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) liked.

<p/>As to the management of their children, his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) theory was much better than
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) wife's, and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) practice not so bad. <div class="bookquote">``I could manage them very
well, if it were not for Mary's interference,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>was what Anne often
heard him (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) say, and had a good deal of faith in; but when listening in
turn to Mary's reproach of <div class="bookquote">``Charles spoils the children so that I
cannot get them into any order,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) never had the smallest temptation
to say, <div class="bookquote">``Very true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>One of the least agreeable circumstances of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) residence there was her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
being treated with too much confidence by all parties, and being too
much in the secret of the complaints of each house. Known to have some
influence with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sister, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was continually requested, or at least
receiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable. <div class="bookquote">``I wish you
could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>was
Charles's language; and, in an unhappy mood, thus spoke Mary: <div class="bookquote">``I do
believe if Charles were to see me dying, he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) would not think there was
anything the matter with me. I am sure, Anne, if you would, you might
persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) that I really am very ill--a great deal worse than I ever
own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary's declaration was, <div class="bookquote">``I hate sending the children to the Great
House, though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
humours and indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so much
trash and sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross
for the rest of the day.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity
of being alone with Anne, to say, ``Oh! Miss Anne, I cannot help wishing
Mrs Charles had a little of your method with those children. They are
quite different creatures with you! But to be sure, in general they
are so spoilt! It is a pity you cannot put your sister in the way of
managing them. They are as fine healthy children as ever were seen,
poor little dears! without partiality; but Mrs Charles knows no more
how they should be treated--! Bless me! how troublesome they are
sometimes. I assure you, Miss Anne, it prevents my wishing to see them
at our house so often as I otherwise should. I believe Mrs Charles is
not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is
very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking
every moment; ``don't do this,'' and ``don't do that;<div class="bookquote">'' or that one can
only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had this communication, moreover, from Mary. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs Musgrove thinks
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) servants so steady, that it would be high treason to call it in
question; but I am sure, without exaggeration, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) upper
house-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being in their business, are
gadding about the village, all day long. I meet them wherever I go;
and I declare, I never go twice into my nursery without seeing
something of them. If Jemima were not the trustiest, steadiest
creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her (<font color='blue'><b>Jemima</b></font>); for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jemima</b></font>) tells
me, they are always tempting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jemima</b></font>) to take a walk with them.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>And on Mrs
Musgrove's side, it was, <div class="bookquote">``I make a rule of never interfering in any of
my daughter-in-law's concerns, for I know it would not do; but I shall
tell you, Miss Anne, because you may be able to set things to rights,
that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles's nursery-maid: I hear
strange stories of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is always upon the gad; and from my own
knowledge, I can declare, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is such a fine-dressing lady, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is
enough to ruin any servants she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) comes near. Mrs Charles quite swears
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), I know; but I just give you this hint, that you may be upon the
watch; because, if you see anything amiss, you need not be afraid of
mentioning it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div><p/>Again, it was Mary's complaint, that Mrs Musgrove was very apt not to
give her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) the precedence that was her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) due, when they dined at the Great
House with other families; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) did not see any reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) was
to be considered so much at home as to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) place. And one day
when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them after
talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said, <div class="bookquote">``I have no
scruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are about
their place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you
are about it; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that it would
be a great deal better if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) were not so very tenacious, especially if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma.
Nobody doubts her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) right to have precedence of mamma, but it would be
more becoming in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) not to be always insisting on it. It is not that
mamma cares about it the least in the world, but I know it is taken
notice of by many persons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>people jealousy</b></font>)</div><p/>How was Anne to set all these matters to rights? She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could do little
more than listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each to
the other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between
such near neighbours, and make those hints broadest which were meant
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sister's benefit.

<p/>In all other respects, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) visit began and proceeded very well. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
own spirits improved by change of place and subject, by being removed
three miles from Kellynch; Mary's ailments lessened by having a
constant companion, and their daily intercourse with the other family,
since there was neither superior affection, confidence, nor employment
in the cottage, to be interrupted by it, was rather an advantage. It
was certainly carried nearly as far as possible, for they met every
morning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) believed
they should not have done so well without the sight of Mr and Mrs
Musgrove's respectable forms in the usual places, or without the
talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves, but
having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents, to sit
by and fancy themselves delighted, her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) performance was little thought
of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) was well
aware. She (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) knew that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) played she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) was giving pleasure only to
herself; but this was no new sensation. Excepting one short period of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had never, since the age of fourteen, never since the
loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) dear mother, known the happiness of being listened to, or
encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste. In music she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had
been always used to feel alone in the world; and Mr and Mrs Musgrove's
fond partiality for their own daughters' performance, and total
indifference to any other person's, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) much more pleasure for
their sakes, than mortification for her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) own.

<p/>The party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company.
The neighbourhood was not large, but the Musgroves were visited by
everybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers, more visitors
by invitation and by chance, than any other family. They were more
completely popular.

<p/>The girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally,
in an unpremeditated little ball. There was a family of cousins within
a walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances, who depended on
the Musgroves for all their pleasures: they would come at any time,
and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne, very much
preferring the office of musician to a more active post, played country
dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which always
recommended her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove
more than anything else, and often drew this compliment;--<div class="bookquote">``Well done,
Miss Anne! very well done indeed! Lord bless me! how those little
fingers of yours fly about!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div><p/>So passed the first three weeks. Michaelmas came; and now Anne's heart
must be in Kellynch again. A beloved home made over to others; all the
precious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects, beginning to own
other eyes and other limbs! She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not think of much else on the
29th of September; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had this sympathetic touch in the evening
from Mary, who, on having occasion to note down the day of the month,
exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Dear me, is not this the day the Crofts were to come to
Kellynch? I am glad I did not think of it before. How low it makes
me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div><p/>The Crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and were to be
visited. Mary deplored the necessity for herself. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody knew how
much she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) should suffer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) should put it off as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could;''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but was not easy till she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had talked Charles into driving her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) over on
an early day, and was in a very animated, comfortable state of
imaginary agitation, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came back. Anne had very sincerely
rejoiced in there being no means of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) going. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wished, however to
see the Crofts, and was glad to be within when the visit was returned.
They came: the master of the house was not at home, but the two
sisters were together; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the
share of Anne, while the Admiral sat by Mary, and made himself very
agreeable by his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) good-humoured notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) little boys, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was well
able to watch for a likeness, and if it failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) in the features, to
catch it in the voice, or in the turn of sentiment and expression.

<p/>Mrs Croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness, uprightness,
and vigour of form, which gave importance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) person. She (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) had
bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face; though
her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>)
having been almost as much at sea as her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) husband, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) seem to have
lived some years longer in the world than her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) real eight-and-thirty.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had no distrust
of herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any approach to
coarseness, however, or any want of good humour. Anne gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) credit,
indeed, for feelings of great consideration towards herself, in all
that related to Kellynch, and it pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>): especially, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had
satisfied herself in the very first half minute, in the instant even of
introduction, that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge
or suspicion on Mrs Croft's side, to give a bias of any sort. She (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) was
quite easy on that head, and consequently full of strength and courage,
till for a moment electrified by Mrs Croft's suddenly saying,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had the
pleasure of being acquainted with, when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was in this country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Croft/Croft</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) certainly had not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you may not have heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is married?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Croft/Croft</b></font>)</div>added Mrs Croft.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) could now answer as she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) ought; and was happy to feel, when Mrs
Croft's next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) spoke,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) had said nothing which might not do for either brother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>)
immediately felt how reasonable it was, that Mrs Croft should be
thinking and speaking of Edward, and not of Frederick; and with shame
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their
former neighbour's present state with proper interest.

<p/>The rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving, she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>)
heard the Admiral say to Mary--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft's here soon; I dare say you
know him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) by name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys, clinging to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) like an old friend, and declaring he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) should not go; and being too
much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) coat pockets,
&c., to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) had
begun, Anne was left to persuade herself, as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could, that
the same brother must still be in question. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not, however,
reach such a degree of certainty, as not to be anxious to hear whether
anything had been said on the subject at the other house, where the
Crofts had previously been calling.

<p/>The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day at
the Cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to
be made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for, when the
youngest Miss Musgrove walked in. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) was coming to apologize,
and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves, was the
first black idea; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted, when Louisa
made all right by saying, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) only came on foot, to leave more
room for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I will tell you our reason,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``and all about it. I am
come on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are out of spirits this
evening, especially mamma; she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) is thinking so much of poor Richard!
And we agreed it would be best to have the harp, for it seems to amuse
her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) more than the piano-forte. I will tell you why she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) is out of
spirits. When the Crofts called this morning, -LRB-they called here
afterwards, did not they?-RRB-, they happened to say, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) brother,
Captain Wentworth, is just returned to England, or paid off, or
something, and is coming to see them almost directly; and most
unluckily it came into mamma's head, when they were gone, that
Wentworth, or something very like it, was the name of poor Richard's
captain at one time; I do not know when or where, but a great while
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) died, poor fellow! And upon looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) letters and
things, she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) found it was so, and is perfectly sure that this must be
the very man, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) head is quite full of it, and of poor Richard!
So we must be as merry as we can, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) may not be dwelling upon
such gloomy things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were,
that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome,
hopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) reached his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
twentieth year; that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had been sent to sea because he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was stupid and
unmanageable on shore; that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had been very little cared for at any
time by his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) family, though quite as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) deserved; seldom heard
of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) death
abroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had, in fact, though his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sisters were now doing all they could for
him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), by calling him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``poor Richard,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>been nothing better than a
thick-headed, unfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never done
anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) name,
living or dead.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those
removals to which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such
midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on
board Captain Frederick Wentworth's frigate, the Laconia; and from the
Laconia he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had, under the influence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) captain, written the only
two letters which his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) father and mother had ever received from him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
during the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) absence; that is to say, the only two
disinterested letters; all the rest had been mere applications for
money.

<p/>In each letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had spoken well of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) captain; but yet, so little
were they in the habit of attending to such matters, so unobservant and
incurious were they as to the names of men or ships, that it had made
scarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove should have
been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection of the name of
Wentworth, as connected with her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) son, seemed one of those extraordinary
bursts of mind which do sometimes occur.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) letters, and found it all as she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) supposed; and the
re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval, her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) poor son
gone for ever, and all the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) faults forgotten, had
affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) spirits exceedingly, and thrown her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) into greater grief for
him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) than she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had known on first hearing of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) death. Mr Musgrove was,
in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when they reached the
cottage, they were evidently in want, first, of being listened to anew
on this subject, and afterwards, of all the relief which cheerful
companions could give them.

<p/>To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) name
so often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it
might, that it probably would, turn out to be the very same Captain
Wentworth whom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their
coming back from Clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say
whether it was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to
Anne's nerves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found, however, that it was one to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must
inure herself. Since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) actually was expected in the country, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must
teach herself to be insensible on such points. And not only did it
appear that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was expected, and speedily, but the Musgroves, in their
warm gratitude for the kindness he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had shewn poor Dick, and very high
respect for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) character, stamped as it was by poor Dick's having been
six months under his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) care, and mentioning him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) in strong, though not
perfectly well-spelt praise, as <div class="bookquote">``a fine dashing felow, only two
perticular about the schoolmaster,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>were bent on introducing
themselves, and seeking his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) acquaintance, as soon as they could hear of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) arrival.

<p/>The resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening.



<p/>Chapter 7


<p/>A very few days more, and Captain Wentworth was known to be at
Kellynch, and Mr Musgrove had called on him (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>), and come back warm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)
praise, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross, by
the end of another week. It had been a great disappointment to Mr
Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed, so impatient was
he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) to shew his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) gratitude, by seeing Captain Wentworth under his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) own
roof, and welcoming him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) to all that was strongest and best in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
cellars. But a week must pass; only a week, in Anne's reckoning, and
then, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) supposed, they must meet; and soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) began to wish that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
could feel secure even for a week.

<p/>Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove's civility,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was all but calling there in the same half hour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and Mary
were actually setting forward for the Great House, where, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
afterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>), when they were
stopped by the eldest boy's being at that moment brought home in
consequence of a bad fall. The child's situation put the visit
entirely aside; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not hear of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) escape with indifference,
even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) account.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury received in
the back, as roused the most alarming ideas. It was an afternoon of
distress, and Anne had every thing to do at once; the apothecary to
send for, the father to have pursued and informed, the mother to
support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control, the youngest
child to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe;
besides sending, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) recollected it, proper notice to the
other house, which brought her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) an accession rather of frightened,
enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brother's return was the first comfort; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could take best care of
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary.
Till he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were the
worse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where;
but now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr Robinson felt
and felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words both to the
father and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best, and to be
able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind; and then
it was, just before they parted, that the two young aunts were able so
far to digress from their nephew's state, as to give the information of
Captain Wentworth's visit; staying five minutes behind their father and
mother, to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable they thought him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
than any individual among their male acquaintance, who had been at all
a favourite before. How glad they had been to hear papa invite him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) to
stay dinner, how sorry when he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) said it was quite out of his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) power, and
how glad again when he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) had promised in reply to papa and mamma's
farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the
morrow--actually on the morrow; and he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) had promised it in so pleasant a
manner, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) felt all the motive of their attention just as he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
ought. And in short, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) had looked and said everything with such
exquisite grace, that they could assure them all, their heads were both
turned by him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>); and off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and
apparently more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles.

<p/>The same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girls
came with their father, through the gloom of the evening, to make
enquiries; and Mr Musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) heir, could add his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) confirmation and praise, and hope there would
be now no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off, and only be sorry
to think that the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the
little boy, to give him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) the meeting. <div class="bookquote">``Oh no; as to leaving the little
boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>father mother</b></font>)</div>both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm
to bear the thought; and Anne, in the joy of the escape, could not help
adding her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) warm protestations to theirs.

<p/>Charles Musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination; <div class="bookquote">``the
child was going on so well, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wished so much to be introduced to
Captain Wentworth, that, perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) might join them in the evening; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
would not dine from home, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) might walk in for half an hour.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>But
in this he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was eagerly opposed by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife, with <div class="bookquote">``Oh! no, indeed,
Charles, I cannot bear to have you go away. Only think if anything
should happen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>The child had a good night, and was going on well the next day. It
must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the
spine; but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm, and Charles
Musgrove began, consequently, to feel no necessity for longer
confinement. The child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as
possible; but what was there for a father to do? This was quite a
female case, and it would be highly absurd in him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), who could be of no
use at home, to shut himself up. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father very much wished him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to
meet Captain Wentworth, and there being no sufficient reason against
it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) ought to go; and it ended in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) making a bold, public
declaration, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) came in from shooting, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) meaning to dress
directly, and dine at the other house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing can be going on better than the child,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``so I told my
father, just now, that I would come, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thought me quite right.
Your sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple at all. You
would not like to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) yourself, but you see I can be of no use.
Anne will send for me if anything is the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain.
Mary knew, from Charles's manner of speaking, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was quite
determined on going, and that it would be of no use to teaze him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
said nothing, therefore, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was out of the room, but as soon as
there was only Anne to hear--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this poor sick
child; and not a creature coming near us all the evening! I knew how
it would be. This is always my luck. If there is anything
disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it, and Charles
is as bad as any of them. Very unfeeling! I must say it is very
unfeeling of him (<font color='blue'><b>creature</b></font>) to be running away from his (<font color='blue'><b>creature</b></font>) poor little boy. Talks of
his (<font color='blue'><b>creature</b></font>) being going on so well! How does he (<font color='blue'><b>creature</b></font>) know that he (<font color='blue'><b>creature</b></font>) is going on well,
or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence? I did not
think Charles would have been so unfeeling. So here he (<font color='blue'><b>creature</b></font>) is to go away
and enjoy himself, and because I am the poor mother, I am not to be
allowed to stir; and yet, I am sure, I am more unfit than anybody else
to be about the child. My being the mother is the very reason why my
feelings should not be tried. I am not at all equal to it. You saw
how hysterical I was yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--of the
shock. You will not be hysterical again. I dare say we shall have
nothing to distress us. I perfectly understand Mr Robinson's
directions, and have no fears; and indeed, Mary, I cannot wonder at
your husband. Nursing does not belong to a man; it is not his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
province. A sick child is always the mother's property: her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own
feelings generally make it so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother, but I do not know that
I am of any more use in the sick-room than Charles, for I cannot be
always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill; and you saw,
this morning, that if I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to keep quiet, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sure to begin
kicking about. I have not nerves for the sort of thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending the whole
evening away from the poor boy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; you see his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) papa can, and why should not I? Jemima is so
careful; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jemima</b></font>) could send us word every hour how he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was. I really
think Charles might as well have told his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father we would all come. I
am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is. I was
dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself,
suppose you were to go, as well as your husband. Leave little Charles
to my care. Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remain
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you serious?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>cried Mary, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes brightening. <div class="bookquote">``Dear me! that's
a very good thought, very good, indeed. To be sure, I may just as well
go as not, for I am of no use at home--am I? and it only harasses me.
You, who have not a mother's feelings, are a great deal the properest
person. You can make little Charles do anything; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) always minds you
at a word. It will be a great deal better than leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) only with
Jemima. Oh! I shall certainly go; I am sure I ought if I can, quite as
much as Charles, for they want me excessively to be acquainted with
Captain Wentworth, and I know you do not mind being left alone. An
excellent thought of yours, indeed, Anne. I will go and tell Charles,
and get ready directly. You can send for us, you know, at a moment's
notice, if anything is the matter; but I dare say there will be nothing
to alarm you. I should not go, you may be sure, if I did not feel
quite at ease about my dear child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The next moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was tapping at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) husband's dressing-room door,
and as Anne followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) up stairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was in time for the whole
conversation, which began with Mary's saying, in a tone of great
exultation--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean to go with you, Charles, for I am of no more use at home than
you are. If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child, I should
not be able to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to do anything he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) did not like. Anne will
stay; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). It is
Anne's own proposal, and so I shall go with you, which will be a great
deal better, for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is very kind of Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) husband's answer, <div class="bookquote">``and I should be
very glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) should be
left at home by herself, to nurse our sick child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne was now at hand to take up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own cause, and the sincerity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
manner being soon sufficient to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), where conviction was at
least very agreeable, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had no farther scruples as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) being left
to dine alone, though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) still wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to join them in the evening,
when the child might be at rest for the night, and kindly urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to
let him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) come and fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was quite unpersuadable; and this
being the case, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off
together in high spirits. They were gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hoped, to be happy,
however oddly constructed such happiness might seem; as for herself,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was left with as many sensations of comfort, as were, perhaps, ever
likely to be hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew herself to be of the first utility to the
child; and what was it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) if Frederick Wentworth were only half a
mile distant, making himself agreeable to others?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would have liked to know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) felt as to a meeting. Perhaps
indifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
must be either indifferent or unwilling. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) wished ever to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) need not have waited till this time; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) would have done what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not but believe that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) place she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) should have done long
ago, when events had been early giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) the independence which alone
had been wanting.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance,
and their visit in general. There had been music, singing, talking,
laughing, all that was most agreeable; charming manners in Captain
Wentworth, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all to know each other
perfectly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was coming the very next morning to shoot with
Charles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was to come to breakfast, but not at the Cottage, though
that had been proposed at first; but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had been pressed to come
to the Great House instead, and he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) seemed afraid of being in Mrs
Charles Musgrove's way, on account of the child, and therefore,
somehow, they hardly knew how, it ended in Charles's being to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>)
to breakfast at his (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) father's.

<p/>Anne understood it. He (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) wished to avoid seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) had inquired
after her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found, slightly, as might suit a former slight
acquaintance, seeming to acknowledge such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had acknowledged,
actuated, perhaps, by the same view of escaping introduction when they
were to meet.

<p/>The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the
other house, and on the morrow the difference was so great that Mary
and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when Charles came in to
say that they were just setting off, that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was come for his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) dogs,
that his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) sisters were following with Captain Wentworth; his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) sisters
meaning to visit Mary and the child, and Captain Wentworth proposing
also to wait on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) for a few minutes if not inconvenient; and though
Charles had answered for the child's being in no such state as could
make it inconvenient, Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) running on to give notice.

<p/>Mary, very much gratified by this attention, was delighted to receive
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne, of which this was the
most consoling, that it would soon be over. And it was soon over. In
two minutes after Charles's preparation, the others appeared; they were
in the drawing-room. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) eye half met Captain Wentworth's, a bow, a
curtsey passed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) voice; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) talked to Mary, said all that
was right, said something to the Miss Musgroves, enough to mark an easy
footing; the room seemed full, full of persons and voices, but a few
minutes ended it. Charles shewed himself at the window, all was ready,
their visitor had bowed and was gone, the Miss Musgroves were gone too,
suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the
sportsmen: the room was cleared, and Anne might finish her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) breakfast
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is over! it is over!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) repeated to herself again and again, in
nervous gratitude. <div class="bookquote">``The worst is over!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary talked, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not attend. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>). They had
met. They had been once more in the same room.

<p/>Soon, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling
less. Eight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been
given up. How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an
interval had banished into distance and indistinctness! What might not
eight years do? Events of every description, changes, alienations,
removals--all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past--
how natural, how certain too! It included nearly a third part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
own life.

<p/>Alas! with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) reasoning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found, that to retentive feelings
eight years may be little more than nothing.

<p/>Now, how were his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sentiments to be read? Was this like wishing to
avoid her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)? And the next moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was hating herself for the folly
which asked the question.

<p/>On one other question which perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) utmost wisdom might not have
prevented, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was soon spared all suspense; for, after the Miss
Musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the Cottage she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgroves</b></font>) had
this spontaneous information from Mary:--

<p/>``Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you, Anne, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was so
attentive to me. Henrietta asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) thought of you, when they
went away, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You were so altered he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) should not have known
you again.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary had no feelings to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) respect her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sister's in a common way,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar
wound.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Altered beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) knowledge.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>Anne fully submitted, in silent, deep
mortification. Doubtless it was so, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could take no revenge, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgroves</b></font>) was not altered, or not for the worse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had already acknowledged
it to herself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not think differently, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Musgroves</b></font>) think of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgroves</b></font>) would. No: the years which had destroyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) youth and
bloom had only given him (<font color='blue'><b>Musgroves</b></font>) a more glowing, manly, open look, in no
respect lessening his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgroves</b></font>) personal advantages. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had seen the same
Frederick Wentworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So altered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) should not have known her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) again!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>These were words
which could not but dwell with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) soon began to rejoice that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had heard them. They were of sobering tendency; they allayed
agitation; they composed, and consequently must make her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) happier.

<p/>Frederick Wentworth had used such words, or something like them, but
without an idea that they would be carried round to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had
thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wretchedly altered, and in the first moment of appeal, had
spoken as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) felt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had not forgiven Anne Elliot. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had used him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
ill, deserted and disappointed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>); and worse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had shewn a
feebleness of character in doing so, which his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) own decided, confident
temper could not endure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) up to oblige others. It
had been the effect of over-persuasion. It had been weakness and
timidity.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had been most warmly attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), and had never seen a woman
since whom he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) equal; but, except from some natural
sensation of curiosity, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had no desire of meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) again. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
power with him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was gone for ever.

<p/>It was now his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) object to marry. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was rich, and being turned on
shore, fully intended to settle as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) could be properly
tempted; actually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the
speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had a heart
for either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart, in
short, for any pleasing young woman who came in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) way, excepting Anne
Elliot. This was his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) only secret exception, when he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
sister, in answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) suppositions:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, here I am, Sophia, quite ready to make a foolish match. Anybody
between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking. A little beauty,
and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy, and I am a lost
man. Should not this be enough for a sailor, who has had no society
among women to make him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) nice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) said it, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) knew, to be contradicted. His (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) bright proud eye spoke
the conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was nice; and Anne Elliot was not out of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
thoughts, when he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) more seriously described the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) should wish to
meet with. <div class="bookquote">``A strong mind, with sweetness of manner,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>made the first
and the last of the description.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the woman I want,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Something a little inferior I
shall of course put up with, but it must not be much. If I am a fool,
I shall be a fool indeed, for I have thought on the subject more than
most men.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 8


<p/>From this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly in the
same circle. They were soon dining in company together at Mr
Musgrove's, for the little boy's state could no longer supply his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) aunt
with a pretence for absenting herself; and this was but the beginning
of other dinings and other meetings.

<p/>Whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the
proof; former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of
each; they could not but be reverted to; the year of their engagement
could not but be named by him (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>), in the little narratives or descriptions
which conversation called forth. His (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) profession qualified him (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)
disposition lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>), to talk; and <div class="bookquote">``That was in the year six;''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That
happened before I went to sea in the year six,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>occurred in the course
of the first evening they spent together: and though his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) voice did not
falter, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had no reason to suppose his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) eye wandering
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) spoke, Anne felt the utter impossibility, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) mind, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) could be unvisited by remembrance any
more than herself. There must be the same immediate association of
thought, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain.

<p/>They had no conversation together, no intercourse but what the
commonest civility required. Once so much to each other! Now nothing!
There had been a time, when of all the large party now filling the
drawing-room at Uppercross, they would have found it most difficult to
cease to speak to one another. With the exception, perhaps, of Admiral
and Mrs Croft, who seemed particularly attached and happy, -LRB-Anne could
allow no other exceptions even among the married couples-RRB-, there could
have been no two hearts so open, no tastes so similar, no feelings so
in unison, no countenances so beloved. Now they were as strangers;
nay, worse than strangers, for they could never become acquainted. It
was a perpetual estrangement.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) talked, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heard the same voice, and discerned the same mind.
There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the
party; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) was very much questioned, and especially by the two Miss
Musgroves, who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>), as to the
manner of living on board, daily regulations, food, hours, &c., and
their surprise at his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) accounts, at learning the degree of accommodation
and arrangement which was practicable, drew from him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) some pleasant
ridicule, which reminded Anne of the early days when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) too had been
ignorant, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) too had been accused of supposing sailors to be
living on board without anything to eat, or any cook to dress it if
there were, or any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use.

<p/>From thus listening and thinking, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was roused by a whisper of Mrs
Musgrove's who, overcome by fond regrets, could not help saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Miss Anne, if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son, I dare
say he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would have been just such another by this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne suppressed a smile, and listened kindly, while Mrs Musgrove
relieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore,
could not keep pace with the conversation of the others.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) could let her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) attention take its natural course again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)
found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List -LRB-their own navy
list, the first that had ever been at Uppercross-RRB-, and sitting down
together to pore over it, with the professed view of finding out the
ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your first was the Asp, I remember; we will look for the Asp.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not find her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) there. Quite worn out and broken up. I was the
last man who commanded her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Hardly fit for service then. Reported fit
for home service for a year or two, and so I was sent off to the West
Indies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girls</b></font>)</div><p/>The girls looked all amazement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Admiralty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``entertain themselves now and then, with
sending a few hundred men to sea, in a ship not fit to be employed.
But they have a great many to provide for; and among the thousands that
may just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible for them to
distinguish the very set who may be least missed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Phoo! phoo!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Admiral stuff</b></font>)</div>cried the Admiral, <div class="bookquote">``what stuff these young fellows talk!
Never was a better sloop than the Asp in her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) day. For an old built
sloop, you would not see her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) equal. Lucky fellow to get her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) knows
there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) at
the same time. Lucky fellow to get anything so soon, with no more
interest than his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Admiral stuff</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I felt my luck, Admiral, I assure you;''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>replied Captain Wentworth,
seriously. <div class="bookquote">``I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can
desire. It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea; a
very great object, I wanted to be doing something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure you did. What should a young fellow like you do ashore for
half a year together? If a man had not a wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soon wants to be
afloat again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Captain Wentworth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Louisa Musgrove</b></font>)</div>cried Louisa, <div class="bookquote">``how vexed you must have been
when you came to the Asp, to see what an old thing they had given you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Louisa Musgrove</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew pretty well what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was before that day;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), smiling.
<div class="bookquote">``I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the
fashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen lent about
among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember, and which
at last, on some very wet day, is lent to yourself. Ah! she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was a dear
old Asp to me. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did all that I wanted. I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would. I knew
that we should either go to the bottom together, or that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would be
the making of me; and I never had two days of foul weather all the time
I was at sea in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); and after taking privateers enough to be very
entertaining, I had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn,
to fall in with the very French frigate I wanted. I brought her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) into
Plymouth; and here another instance of luck. We had not been six hours
in the Sound, when a gale came on, which lasted four days and nights,
and which would have done for poor old Asp in half the time; our touch
with the Great Nation not having much improved our condition.
Four-and-twenty hours later, and I should only have been a gallant
Captain Wentworth, in a small paragraph at one corner of the
newspapers; and being lost in only a sloop, nobody would have thought
about me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>Anne's shudderings were to herself alone; but the Miss
Musgroves could be as open as they were sincere, in their exclamations
of pity and horror.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so then, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Musgrove, in a low voice, as if
thinking aloud, <div class="bookquote">``so then he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) went away to the Laconia, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) met
with our poor boy. Charles, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>-LRB-beckoning him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``do ask
Captain Wentworth where it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) first met with your poor brother. I
always forgot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was at Gibraltar, mother, I know. Dick had been left ill at
Gibraltar, with a recommendation from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) former captain to Captain
Wentworth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! but, Charles, tell Captain Wentworth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) need not be afraid of
mentioning poor Dick before me, for it would be rather a pleasure to
hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) talked of by such a good friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles, being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case,
only nodded in reply, and walked away.

<p/>The girls were now hunting for the Laconia; and Captain Wentworth could
not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
own hands to save them the trouble, and once more read aloud the little
statement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) name and rate, and present non-commissioned class,
observing over it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) too had been one of the best friends man
ever had.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia! How fast I made
money in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise together
off the Western Islands. Poor Harville, sister! You know how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>)
wanted money: worse than myself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) had a wife. Excellent fellow. I
shall never forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) happiness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) felt it all, so much for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
sake. I wished for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) again the next summer, when I had still the
same luck in the Mediterranean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I am sure, Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Musgrove, <div class="bookquote">``it was a lucky day for us,
when you were put captain into that ship. We shall never forget what
you did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) feelings made her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) speak low; and Captain Wentworth, hearing only in
part, and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all near his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) thoughts,
looked rather in suspense, and as if waiting for more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>whispered one of the girls; <div class="bookquote">``mamma is thinking of poor
Richard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor dear fellow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs Musgrove; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was grown so steady,
and such an excellent correspondent, while he (<font color='blue'><b>correspondent</b></font>) was under your care! Ah!
it would have been a happy thing, if he (<font color='blue'><b>correspondent</b></font>) had never left you. I assure
you, Captain Wentworth, we are very sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) ever left you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth's face at this
speech, a certain glance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) bright eye, and curl of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) handsome
mouth, which convinced Anne, that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove's
kind wishes, as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) son, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had probably been at some pains to get
rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); but it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to
be detected by any who understood him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) less than herself; in another
moment he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was perfectly collected and serious, and almost instantly
afterwards coming up to the sofa, on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) and Mrs Musgrove were
sitting, took a place by the latter, and entered into conversation with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>), in a low voice, about her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) son, doing it with so much sympathy and
natural grace, as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was
real and unabsurd in the parent's feelings.

<p/>They were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had most readily
made room for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove. It was no
insignificant barrier, indeed. Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable,
substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature to express good
cheer and good humour, than tenderness and sentiment; and while the
agitations of Anne's slender form, and pensive face, may be considered
as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth should be allowed some
credit for the self-command with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) attended to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) large fat
sighings over the destiny of a son, whom alive nobody had cared for.

<p/>Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary
proportions. A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep
affliction, as the most graceful set of limbs in the world. But, fair
or not fair, there are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will
patronize in vain--which taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule will
seize.

<p/>The Admiral, after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>), being called to order by his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) wife, now came
up to Captain Wentworth, and without any observation of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) might
be interrupting, thinking only of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) own thoughts, began with--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you had been a week later at Lisbon, last spring, Frederick, you
would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson and her (<font color='blue'><b>Grierson</b></font>)
daughters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Should I? I am glad I was not a week later then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Admiral</b></font>)</div><p/>The Admiral abused him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) want of gallantry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) defended himself;
though professing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) would never willingly admit any ladies on
board a ship of his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>), excepting for a ball, or a visit, which a few
hours might comprehend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, if I know myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``this is from no want of gallantry
towards them. It is rather from feeling how impossible it is, with all
one's efforts, and all one's sacrifices, to make the accommodations on
board such as women ought to have. There can be no want of gallantry,
Admiral, in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high,
and this is what I do. I hate to hear of women on board, or to see

of ladies anywhere, if I can help it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) sister upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Frederick! But I cannot believe it of you.--All idle
refinement!--Women may be as comfortable on board, as in the best house
in England. I believe I have lived as much on board as most women, and

your husband, and were the only woman on board.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you, yourself, brought Mrs Harville, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) sister, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) cousin, and

superfine, extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All merged in my friendship, Sophia. I would assist any brother

a different tune. When he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is married, if we have the good luck to live
to another war, we shall see him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) do as you and I, and a great many
others, have done. We shall have him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) very thankful to anybody that

 (<font color='red'><b>the Admiral</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, that we shall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I have done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>cried Captain Wentworth. ``When once married people

you are married.'' I can only say, ``No, I shall not;' and then they say
again, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, you will,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and there is an end of it.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) got up and moved away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a great traveller you must have been, ma'am!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Musgrove
to Mrs Croft.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty well, ma'am in the fifteen years of my marriage; though many
women have done more. I have crossed the Atlantic four times, and have
been once to the East Indies, and back again, and only once; besides
being in different places about home: Cork, and Lisbon, and Gibraltar.
But I never went beyond the Streights, and never was in the West
Indies. We do not call Bermuda or Bahama, you know, the West Indies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent; she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) could not accuse
herself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)
life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I do assure you, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Croft/Croft</b></font>)</div>pursued Mrs Croft, <div class="bookquote">``that nothing can
exceed the accommodations of a man-of-war; I speak, you know, of the
higher rates. When you come to a frigate, of course, you are more
confined; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of
them; and I can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has been
spent on board a ship. While we were together, you know, there was
nothing to be feared. Thank God! I have always been blessed with
excellent health, and no climate disagrees with me. A little
disordered always the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, but
never knew what sickness was afterwards. The only time I ever really
suffered in body or mind, the only time that I ever fancied myself
unwell, or had any ideas of danger, was the winter that I passed by
myself at Deal, when the Admiral -LRB-Captain Croft then-RRB- was in the North
Seas. I lived in perpetual fright at that time, and had all manner of
imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself, or when I
should hear from him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) next; but as long as we could be together, nothing
ever ailed me, and I never met with the smallest inconvenience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Croft/Croft</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, to be sure. Yes, indeed, oh yes! I am quite of your opinion,
Mrs Croft,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>was Mrs Musgrove's hearty answer. <div class="bookquote">``There is nothing so bad
as a separation. I am quite of your opinion. I know what it is, for
Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes, and I am so glad when they are
over, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) is safe back again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The evening ended with dancing. On its being proposed, Anne offered
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) services, as usual; and though her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes would sometimes fill with
tears as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sat at the instrument, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was extremely glad to be
employed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved.

<p/>It was a merry, joyous party, and no one seemed in higher spirits than
Captain Wentworth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had every thing to elevate him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
which general attention and deference, and especially the attention of
all the young women, could do. The Miss Hayters, the females of the
family of cousins already mentioned, were apparently admitted to the
honour of being in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>); and as for Henrietta and Louisa, they
both seemed so entirely occupied by him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), that nothing but the continued
appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves could have
made it credible that they were not decided rivals. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) were a
little spoilt by such universal, such eager admiration, who could
wonder?

<p/>These were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) fingers
were mechanically at work, proceeding for half an hour together,
equally without error, and without consciousness. Once she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was looking at herself, observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) altered features, perhaps,
trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>); and once she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) must have spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was hardly
aware of it, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heard the answer; but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
having asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) partner whether Miss Elliot never danced? The answer
was, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, no; never; she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) has quite given up dancing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) had rather
play. She (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) is never tired of playing.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Once, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had left the instrument on the dancing being over, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had sat
down to try to make out an air which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) wished to give the Miss
Musgroves an idea of. Unintentionally she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) returned to that part of the
room; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), and, instantly rising, said, with studied politeness--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat;''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
immediately drew back with a decided negative, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was not to be induced
to sit down again.

<p/>Anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) cold
politeness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) ceremonious grace, were worse than anything.



<p/>Chapter 9


<p/>Captain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home, to stay as long as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) liked, being as thoroughly the object of the Admiral's fraternal
kindness as of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) wife's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had intended, on first arriving, to
proceed very soon into Shropshire, and visit the brother settled in
that country, but the attractions of Uppercross induced him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to put this
off. There was so much of friendliness, and of flattery, and of
everything most bewitching in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) reception there; the old were so
hospitable, the young so agreeable, that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could not but resolve to
remain where he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was, and take all the charms and perfections of
Edward's wife upon credit a little longer.

<p/>It was soon Uppercross with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) almost every day. The Musgroves could
hardly be more ready to invite than he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to come, particularly in the
morning, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had no companion at home, for the Admiral and Mrs
Croft were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves in
their new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling about
in a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig,
lately added to their establishment.

<p/>Hitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth among the
Musgroves and their dependencies. It was unvarying, warm admiration
everywhere; but this intimate footing was not more than established,
when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them, to be a good deal
disturbed by it, and to think Captain Wentworth very much in the way.

<p/>Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable,
pleasing young man, between whom and Henrietta there had been a
considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth's
introduction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was in orders; and having a curacy in the
neighbourhood, where residence was not required, lived at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) father's
house, only two miles from Uppercross. A short absence from home had
left his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) fair one unguarded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) attentions at this critical period,
and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) came back he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had the pain of finding very altered manners,
and of seeing Captain Wentworth.

<p/>Mrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters. They had each had money, but
their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of
consequence. Mr Hayter had some property of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) own, but it was
insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove's; and while the Musgroves were
in the first class of society in the country, the young Hayters would,
from their parents' inferior, retired, and unpolished way of living,
and their own defective education, have been hardly in any class at
all, but for their connexion with Uppercross, this eldest son of course
excepted, who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was
very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest.

<p/>The two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no
pride on one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a
consciousness of superiority in the Miss Musgroves, as made them
pleased to improve their cousins. Charles's attentions to Henrietta
had been observed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) father and mother without any disapprobation.
<div class="bookquote">``It would not be a great match for her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>); but if Henrietta liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>),'' (<font color='red'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)</div>--
and Henrietta did seem to like him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/>Henrietta fully thought so herself, before Captain Wentworth came; but
from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten.

<p/>Which of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was as yet
quite doubtful, as far as Anne's observation reached. Henrietta was
perhaps the prettiest, Louisa had the higher spirits; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) knew not
now, whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most
likely to attract him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>).

<p/>Mr and Mrs Musgrove, either from seeing little, or from an entire
confidence in the discretion of both their daughters, and of all the
young men who came near them, seemed to leave everything to take its
chance. There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark
about them in the Mansion-house; but it was different at the Cottage:
the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder; and
Captain Wentworth had not been above four or five times in the Miss
Musgroves' company, and Charles Hayter had but just reappeared, when
Anne had to listen to the opinions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) brother and sister, as to
which was the one liked best. Charles gave it for Louisa, Mary for
Henrietta, but quite agreeing that to have him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) marry either could be
extremely delightful.

<p/>Charles <div class="bookquote">``had never seen a pleasanter man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life; and from what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had
not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war. Here was a
fortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance of what might
be done in any future war; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was sure Captain Wentworth was as
likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy. Oh! it
would be a capital match for either of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) sisters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word it would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>replied Mary. ``Dear me! If he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) should rise to
any very great honours! If he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) should ever be made a baronet! <div class="bookquote">``Lady
Wentworth' sounds very well. That would be a noble thing, indeed, for
Henrietta! She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) would take place of me then, and Henrietta would not
dislike that. Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth! It would be but a new
creation, however, and I never think much of your new creations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div><p/>It suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred on the very
account of Charles Hayter, whose pretensions she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) wished to see put an
end to. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters, and thought
it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between
the families renewed--very sad for herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) children.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I cannot think him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) at all a fit match for
Henrietta; and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) has no right to throw herself away. I do not think any young woman
has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient
to the principal part of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) family, and be giving bad connections to
those who have not been used to them. And, pray, who is Charles
Hayter? Nothing but a country curate. A most improper match for Miss
Musgrove of Uppercross.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) husband, however, would not agree with her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) here; for besides having
a regard for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cousin, Charles Hayter was an eldest son, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) saw
things as an eldest son himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you are talking nonsense, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was therefore his (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) answer. <div class="bookquote">``It
would not be a great match for Henrietta, but Charles has a very fair
chance, through the Spicers, of getting something from the Bishop in
the course of a year or two; and you will please to remember, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>)
is the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) steps into very pretty
property. The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred and
fifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton, which is some of the best
land in the country. I grant you, that any of them but Charles would
be a very shocking match for Henrietta, and indeed it could not be; he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
is the only one that could be possible; but he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is a very good-natured,
good sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop comes into his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
will make a different sort of place of it, and live in a very different
sort of way; and with that property, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) will never be a contemptible
man--good, freehold property. No, no; Henrietta might do worse than
marry Charles Hayter; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) has him (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>), and Louisa can get Captain
Wentworth, I shall be very well satisfied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Charles may say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) pleases,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>cried Mary to Anne, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>)
was out of the room, <div class="bookquote">``but it would be shocking to have Henrietta marry
Charles Hayter; a very bad thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>), and still worse for me; and
therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth may soon
put him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) quite out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) head, and I have very little doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
has. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday. I wish
you had been there to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) behaviour. And as to Captain Wentworth's
liking Louisa as well as Henrietta, it is nonsense to say so; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best. But Charles is so
positive! I wish you had been with us yesterday, for then you might
have decided between us; and I am sure you would have thought as I did,
unless you had been determined to give it against me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A dinner at Mr Musgrove's had been the occasion when all these things
should have been seen by Anne; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had staid at home, under the
mixed plea of a headache of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own, and some return of indisposition
in little Charles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had thought only of avoiding Captain Wentworth;
but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the
advantages of a quiet evening.

<p/>As to Captain Wentworth's views, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) deemed it of more consequence that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) should know his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) own mind early enough not to be endangering the
happiness of either sister, or impeaching his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) own honour, than that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
should prefer Henrietta to Louisa, or Louisa to Henrietta. Either of
them would, in all probability, make him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) an affectionate, good-humoured
wife. With regard to Charles Hayter, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had delicacy which must be
pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young woman, and a
heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned; but if
Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) feelings, the
alteration could not be understood too soon.

<p/>Charles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>)
cousin's behaviour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) had too old a regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) to be so wholly
estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope, and
leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross: but there
was such a change as became very alarming, when such a man as Captain
Wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had been absent
only two Sundays, and when they parted, had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) interested, even
to the height of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) wishes, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) prospect of soon quitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
present curacy, and obtaining that of Uppercross instead. It had then
seemed the object nearest her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector, who
for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties
of his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) office, but was now growing too infirm for many of them, should
be quite fixed on engaging a curate; should make his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) curacy quite as
good as he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise of
it. The advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) having to come only to Uppercross, instead of
going six miles another way; of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) having, in every respect, a better
curacy; of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good Dr
Shirley's being relieved from the duty which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) could no longer get
through without most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to
Louisa, but had been almost everything to Henrietta. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) came
back, alas! the zeal of the business was gone by. Louisa could not
listen at all to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) account of a conversation which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) had just held
with Dr Shirley: she (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) was at a window, looking out for Captain
Wentworth; and even Henrietta had at best only a divided attention to
give, and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude
of the negotiation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am very glad indeed: but I always thought you would have it;
I always thought you sure. It did not appear to me that--in short, you
know, Dr Shirley must have a curate, and you had secured his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) promise.
Is he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) coming, Louisa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>One morning, very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves, at which Anne
had not been present, Captain Wentworth walked into the drawing-room at
the Cottage, where were only herself and the little invalid Charles,
who was lying on the sofa.

<p/>The surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot, deprived
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) manners of their usual composure: he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) started, and could only say,
<div class="bookquote">``I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here: Mrs Musgrove told me I
should find them here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>before he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) walked to the window to recollect
himself, and feel how he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) ought to behave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are up stairs with my sister: they will be down in a few
moments, I dare say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>had been Anne's reply, in all the confusion that
was natural; and if the child had not called her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to come and do
something for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would have been out of the room the next moment,
and released Captain Wentworth as well as herself.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying, <div class="bookquote">``I
hope the little boy is better,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>was silent.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there to satisfy
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) patient; and thus they continued a few minutes, when, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) very
great satisfaction, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heard some other person crossing the little
vestibule. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hoped, on turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head, to see the master of the
house; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters
easy--Charles Hayter, probably not at all better pleased by the sight
of Captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of
Anne.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) only attempted to say, <div class="bookquote">``How do you do? Will you not sit down? The
others will be here presently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Captain Wentworth, however, came from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) window, apparently not
ill-disposed for conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up the
newspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) window.

<p/>Another minute brought another addition. The younger boy, a remarkable
stout, forward child, of two years old, having got the door opened for
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) by some one without, made his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) determined appearance among them, and
went straight to the sofa to see what was going on, and put in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
claim to anything good that might be giving away.

<p/>There being nothing to eat, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could only have some play; and as his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
aunt would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tease his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sick brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) began to fasten
himself upon her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) knelt, in such a way that, busy as she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was
about Charles, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could not shake him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) off. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), ordered,
entreated, and insisted in vain. Once she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did contrive to push him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
away, but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) back
again directly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Walter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``get down this moment. You are extremely
troublesome. I am very angry with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Walter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles Hayter/Hayter/Charles</b></font>)</div>cried Charles Hayter, <div class="bookquote">``why do you not do as you are bid? Do
not you hear your aunt speak? Come to me, Walter, come to cousin
Charles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles Hayter/Hayter/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>But not a bit did Walter stir.

<p/>In another moment, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) found herself in the state of being
released from him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>); some one was taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had bent
down her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) head so much, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) little sturdy hands were unfastened
from around her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) neck, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was resolutely borne away, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) knew
that Captain Wentworth had done it.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sensations on the discovery made her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) perfectly speechless. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
could not even thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could only hang over little Charles,
with most disordered feelings. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) kindness in stepping forward to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
relief, the manner, the silence in which it had passed, the little
particulars of the circumstance, with the conviction soon forced on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
by the noise he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was studiously making with the child, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) meant to
avoid hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thanks, and rather sought to testify that her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
conversation was the last of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) wants, produced such a confusion of
varying, but very painful agitation, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could not recover from,
till enabled by the entrance of Mary and the Miss Musgroves to make
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) little patient to their cares, and leave the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could
not stay. It might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and
jealousies of the four--they were now altogether; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could stay
for none of it. It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well
inclined towards Captain Wentworth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had a strong impression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
having said, in a vext tone of voice, after Captain Wentworth's
interference, <div class="bookquote">``You ought to have minded me, Walter; I told you not to
teaze your aunt;''  (<font color='red'><b>Wentworth/Mr Wentworth</b></font>)</div>and could comprehend his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) regretting that Captain
Wentworth should do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) ought to have done himself. But neither
Charles Hayter's feelings, nor anybody's feelings, could interest her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>),
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had a little better arranged her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was ashamed of
herself, quite ashamed of being so nervous, so overcome by such a
trifle; but so it was, and it required a long application of solitude
and reflection to recover her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).



<p/>Chapter 10


<p/>Other opportunities of making her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) observations could not fail to occur.
Anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough
to have an opinion, though too wise to acknowledge as much at home,
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife; for
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) considered Louisa to be rather the favourite, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not
but think, as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) might dare to judge from memory and
experience, that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either. They
were more in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>); yet there it was not love. It was a little
fever of admiration; but it might, probably must, end in love with
some. Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted, and yet Henrietta
had sometimes the air of being divided between them. Anne longed for
the power of representing to them all what they were about, and of
pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
did not attribute guile to any. It was the highest satisfaction to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
to believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was
occasioning. There was no triumph, no pitiful triumph in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) manner.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had, probably, never heard, and never thought of any claims of
Charles Hayter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) was only wrong in accepting the attentions -LRB-for
accepting must be the word-RRB- of two young women at once.

<p/>After a short struggle, however, Charles Hayter seemed to quit the
field. Three days had passed without his (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) coming once to Uppercross; a
most decided change. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) had even refused one regular invitation to
dinner; and having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some
large books before him (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>), Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be
right, and talked, with grave faces, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) studying himself to death.
It was Mary's hope and belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) had received a positive dismissal
from Henrietta, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) husband lived under the constant dependence of
seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to-morrow. Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter was
wise.

<p/>One morning, about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth
being gone a-shooting together, as the sisters in the Cottage were
sitting quietly at work, they were visited at the window by the sisters
from the Mansion-house.

<p/>It was a very fine November day, and the Miss Musgroves came through
the little grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to say, that
they were going to take a long walk, and therefore concluded Mary could
not like to go with them; and when Mary immediately replied, with some
jealousy at not being supposed a good walker, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, I should like
to join you very much, I am very fond of a long walk;''  (<font color='red'><b>a walker</b></font>)</div>Anne felt
persuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely what
they did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity which the
family habits seemed to produce, of everything being to be
communicated, and everything being to be done together, however
undesired and inconvenient. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tried to dissuade Mary from going, but
in vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept the Miss
Musgroves' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) might be useful in turning back with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sister, and lessening the
interference in any plan of their own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long
walk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>said Mary, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went up stairs. <div class="bookquote">``Everybody is always
supposing that I am not a good walker; and yet they would not have been
pleased, if we had refused to join them. When people come in this
manner on purpose to ask us, how can one say no?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentlemen</b></font>)</div><p/>Just as they were setting off, the gentlemen returned. They had taken
out a young dog, who had spoilt their sport, and sent them back early.
Their time and strength, and spirits, were, therefore, exactly ready
for this walk, and they entered into it with pleasure. Could Anne have
foreseen such a junction, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would have staid at home; but, from some
feelings of interest and curiosity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) fancied now that it was too
late to retract, and the whole six set forward together in the
direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves, who evidently considered the
walk as under their guidance.

<p/>Anne's object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where the
narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary, to keep
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) brother and sister. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) pleasure in the walk must arise from
the exercise and the day, from the view of the last smiles of the year
upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges, and from repeating to
herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of
autumn, that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind
of taste and tenderness, that season which had drawn from every poet,
worthy of being read, some attempt at description, or some lines of
feeling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) occupied her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mind as much as possible in such like
musings and quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reach
of Captain Wentworth's conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) should not try to hear it; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) caught little very remarkable.
It was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate
footing, might fall into. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was more engaged with Louisa than with
Henrietta. Louisa certainly put more forward for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) notice than her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>)
sister. This distinction appeared to increase, and there was one
speech of Louisa's which struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>). After one of the many praises of
the day, which were continually bursting forth, Captain Wentworth
added:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister! They meant to
take a long drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from some of
these hills. They talked of coming into this side of the country. I
wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day. Oh! it does happen very
often, I assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would as
lieve be tossed out as not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wentworth/Mr Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! You make the most of it, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Louisa Musgrove</b></font>)</div>cried Louisa, <div class="bookquote">``but if it were
really so, I should do just the same in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) place. If I loved a man,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) loves the Admiral, I would always be with him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>), nothing should
ever separate us, and I would rather be overturned by him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>), than driven
safely by anybody else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Louisa Musgrove</b></font>)</div><p/>It was spoken with enthusiasm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Had you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), catching the same tone; <div class="bookquote">``I honour you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And there
was silence between them for a little while.

<p/>Anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again. The sweet
scenes of autumn were for a while put by, unless some tender sonnet,
fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining
happiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone
together, blessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) memory. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) roused herself to say, as they
struck by order into another path, <div class="bookquote">``Is not this one of the ways to
Winthrop?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>But nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/>Winthrop, however, or its environs--for young men are, sometimes to be
met with, strolling about near home--was their destination; and after
another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures, where the
ploughs at work, and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteracting
the sweets of poetical despondence, and meaning to have spring again,
they gained the summit of the most considerable hill, which parted
Uppercross and Winthrop, and soon commanded a full view of the latter,
at the foot of the hill on the other side.

<p/>Winthrop, without beauty and without dignity, was stretched before them;
an indifferent house, standing low, and hemmed in by the barns and
buildings of a farm-yard.

<p/>Mary exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Bless me! here is Winthrop. I declare I had no idea!
Well now, I think we had better turn back; I am excessively tired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div><p/>Henrietta, conscious and ashamed, and seeing no cousin Charles walking
along any path, or leaning against any gate, was ready to do as Mary
wished; but <div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>said Charles Musgrove, and <div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>cried Louisa
more eagerly, and taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) sister aside, seemed to be arguing the
matter warmly.

<p/>Charles, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) resolution
of calling on his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) aunt, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was so near; and very evidently,
though more fearfully, trying to induce his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) wife to go too. But this
was one of the points on which the lady shewed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) strength; and when
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at
Winthrop, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) felt so tired, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) resolutely answered, <div class="bookquote">``Oh! no,
indeed! walking up that hill again would do her (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) more harm than any
sitting down could do her (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) good;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and, in short, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) look and manner
declared, that go she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would not.

<p/>After a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations,
it was settled between Charles and his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) two sisters, that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) and
Henrietta should just run down for a few minutes, to see their aunt and
cousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the
hill. Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan; and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>)
went a little way with them, down the hill, still talking to Henrietta,
Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and saying
to Captain Wentworth--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very unpleasant, having such connexions! But, I assure you, I
have never been in the house above twice in my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wentworth/Mr Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile,
followed by a contemptuous glance, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) turned away, which Anne
perfectly knew the meaning of.

<p/>The brow of the hill, where they remained, was a cheerful spot: Louisa
returned; and Mary, finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step
of a stile, was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>); but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away, to try for a
gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row, and they were gone by
degrees quite out of sight and sound, Mary was happy no longer; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
quarrelled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own seat, was sure Louisa had got a much better
somewhere, and nothing could prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) from going to look for a
better also. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) turned through the same gate, but could not see them.
Anne found a nice seat for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), on a dry sunny bank, under the
hedge-row, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had no doubt of their still being, in some spot
or other. Mary sat down for a moment, but it would not do; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was
sure Louisa had found a better seat somewhere else, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) would go on
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) overtook her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>).

<p/>Anne, really tired herself, was glad to sit down; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) very soon
heard Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge-row, behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>), as if
making their way back along the rough, wild sort of channel, down the
centre. They were speaking as they drew near. Louisa's voice was the
first distinguished. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) seemed to be in the middle of some eager
speech. What Anne first heard was--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so, I made her (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) go. I could not bear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) should be frightened
from the visit by such nonsense. What! would I be turned back from
doing a thing that I had determined to do, and that I knew to be right,
by the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person I may
say? No, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded. When I have
made up my mind, I have made it; and Henrietta seemed entirely to have
made up hers to call at Winthrop to-day; and yet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) was as near
giving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) would have turned back then, but for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) would indeed. I am almost ashamed to say it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Happy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>), to have such a mind as yours at hand! After the hints
you gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations, the last
time I was in company with him (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>), I need not affect to have no
comprehension of what is going on. I see that more than a mere dutiful
morning visit to your aunt was in question; and woe betide him (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
too, when it comes to things of consequence, when they are placed in
circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind, if she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) have not
resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this.
Your sister is an amiable creature; but yours is the character of
decision and firmness, I see. If you value her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) conduct or happiness,
infuse as much of your own spirit into her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) as you can. But this, no
doubt, you have been always doing. It is the worst evil of too
yielding and indecisive a character, that no influence over it can be
depended on. You are never sure of a good impression being durable;
everybody may sway it. Let those who would be happy be firm. Here is
a nut,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), catching one down from an upper bough, <div class="bookquote">``to exemplify:
a beautiful glossy nut, which, blessed with original strength, has
outlived all the storms of autumn. Not a puncture, not a weak spot
anywhere. This nut,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) continued, with playful solemnity, <div class="bookquote">``while so
many of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot, is still
in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed
capable of.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) former earnest tone--<div class="bookquote">``My first
wish for all whom I am interested in, is that they should be firm. If
Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) November of life,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) will cherish all her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) present powers of mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had done, and was unanswered. It would have surprised Anne if
Louisa could have readily answered such a speech: words of such
interest, spoken with such serious warmth! She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) could imagine what
Louisa was feeling. For herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) feared to move, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) should
be seen. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) remained, a bush of low rambling holly protected
her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>), and they were moving on. Before they were beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) hearing,
however, Louisa spoke again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary is good-natured enough in many respects,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) does
sometimes provoke me excessively, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) nonsense and pride--the Elliot
pride. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride. We do so
wish that Charles had married Anne instead. I suppose you know he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
wanted to marry Anne?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>After a moment's pause, Captain Wentworth said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) refused him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wentworth/Mr Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes; certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When did that happen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not exactly know, for Henrietta and I were at school at the time;
but I believe about a year before he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) married Mary. I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had
accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>). We should all have liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a great deal better; and
papa and mamma always think it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) great friend Lady Russell's
doing, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not. They think Charles might not be learned and
bookish enough to please Lady Russell, and that therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>)
persuaded Anne to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>The sounds were retreating, and Anne distinguished no more. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own
emotions still kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) fixed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had much to recover from, before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could move. The listener's proverbial fate was not absolutely
hers; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had heard no evil of herself, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had heard a great deal
of very painful import. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw how her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own character was considered
by Captain Wentworth, and there had been just that degree of feeling
and curiosity about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) manner which must give her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) extreme
agitation.

<p/>As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went after Mary, and having found, and walked
back with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to their former station, by the stile, felt some comfort
in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected, and once
more in motion together. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) spirits wanted the solitude and silence
which only numbers could give.

<p/>Charles and Henrietta returned, bringing, as may be conjectured,
Charles Hayter with them. The minutiae of the business Anne could not
attempt to understand; even Captain Wentworth did not seem admitted to
perfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawing on the
gentleman's side, and a relenting on the lady's, and that they were now
very glad to be together again, did not admit a doubt. Henrietta
looked a little ashamed, but very well pleased;--Charles Hayter
exceedingly happy: and they were devoted to each other almost from the
first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross.

<p/>Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth; nothing could
be plainer; and where many divisions were necessary, or even where they
were not, they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two. In
a long strip of meadow land, where there was ample space for all, they
were thus divided, forming three distinct parties; and to that party of
the three which boasted least animation, and least complaisance, Anne
necessarily belonged. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) joined Charles and Mary, and was tired
enough to be very glad of Charles's other arm; but Charles, though in
very good humour with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), was out of temper with his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) wife. Mary had
shewn herself disobliging to him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), and was now to reap the consequence,
which consequence was his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) arm almost every moment to cut
off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) switch; and when
Mary began to complain of it, and lament her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) being ill-used, according
to custom, in being on the hedge side, while Anne was never incommoded
on the other, he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which
he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had a momentary glance of, and they could hardly get him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) along at
all.

<p/>This long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end of
it was to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit,
the carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been some time
heard, was just coming up, and proved to be Admiral Croft's gig. He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>)
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home.
Upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in, they
kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired; it
would save her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a full mile, and they were going through Uppercross.
The invitation was general, and generally declined. The Miss Musgroves
were not at all tired, and Mary was either offended, by not being asked
before any of the others, or what Louisa called the Elliot pride could
not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise.

<p/>The walking party had crossed the lane, and were surmounting an
opposite stile, and the Admiral was putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) horse in motion again,
when Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) sister. The something might be guessed by its effects.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Elliot, I am sure you are tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Croft/Croft</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Croft. <div class="bookquote">``Do let us
have the pleasure of taking you home. Here is excellent room for
three, I assure you. If we were all like you, I believe we might sit
four. You must, indeed, you must.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne was still in the lane; and though instinctively beginning to
decline, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was not allowed to proceed. The Admiral's kind urgency
came in support of his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) wife's; they would not be refused; they
compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a
corner, and Captain Wentworth, without saying a word, turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),
and quietly obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to be assisted into the carriage.

<p/>Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had done it. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was in the carriage, and felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had
placed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) there, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) will and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) hands had done it, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
owed it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) perception of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fatigue, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) resolution to give
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) rest. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was very much affected by the view of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) disposition
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), which all these things made apparent. This little
circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) could not forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) could not be
unfeeling. Though condemning her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) for the past, and considering it with
high and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and
though becoming attached to another, still he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) could not see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) suffer,
without the desire of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) relief. It was a remainder of former
sentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged friendship;
it was a proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) own warm and amiable heart, which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could not
contemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew not which prevailed.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) answers to the kindness and the remarks of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) companions were at
first unconsciously given. They had travelled half their way along the
rough lane, before she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was quite awake to what they said. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) then
found them talking of <div class="bookquote">``Frederick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) certainly means to have one or other of those two girls, Sophy,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Admiral</b></font>)</div>said the Admiral; <div class="bookquote">``but there is no saying which. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) has been running
after them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) mind.
Ay, this comes of the peace. If it were war now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) would have settled
it long ago. We sailors, Miss Elliot, cannot afford to make long
courtships in time of war. How many days was it, my dear, between the
first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our
lodgings at North Yarmouth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Admiral</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We had better not talk about it, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Croft/Croft</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs Croft,
pleasantly; <div class="bookquote">``for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an
understanding, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) would never be persuaded that we could be happy
together. I had known you by character, however, long before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Croft/Croft</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we
to wait for besides? I do not like having such things so long in hand.
I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass, and bring us home
one of these young ladies to Kellynch. Then there would always be
company for them. And very nice young ladies they both are; I hardly
know one from the other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Croft/Croft</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Croft, in a
tone of calmer praise, such as made Anne suspect that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) keener powers
might not consider either of them as quite worthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) brother; <div class="bookquote">``and
a very respectable family. One could not be connected with better
people. My dear Admiral, that post! we shall certainly take that
post.''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/>But by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily
passed the danger; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
hand they neither fell into a rut, nor ran foul of a dung-cart; and
Anne, with some amusement at their style of driving, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) imagined
no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs, found
herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage.



<p/>Chapter 11


<p/>The time now approached for Lady Russell's return: the day was even
fixed; and Anne, being engaged to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was
resettled, was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch, and
beginning to think how her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own comfort was likely to be affected by it.

<p/>It would place her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in the same village with Captain Wentworth, within
half a mile of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>); they would have to frequent the same church, and
there must be intercourse between the two families. This was against
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>); but on the other hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) spent so much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) time at Uppercross,
that in removing thence she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) might be considered rather as leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
behind, than as going towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>); and, upon the whole, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) believed
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must, on this interesting question, be the gainer, almost as
certainly as in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) change of domestic society, in leaving poor Mary
for Lady Russell.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) wished it might be possible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) to avoid ever seeing Captain
Wentworth at the Hall: those rooms had witnessed former meetings which
would be brought too painfully before her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was yet more anxious
for the possibility of Lady Russell and Captain Wentworth never meeting
anywhere. They did not like each other, and no renewal of acquaintance
now could do any good; and were Lady Russell to see them together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>)
might think that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had too much self-possession, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) too little.

<p/>These points formed her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) chief solicitude in anticipating her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) removal
from Uppercross, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had been stationed quite long
enough. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) usefulness to little Charles would always give some
sweetness to the memory of her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) two months' visit there, but he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) was
gaining strength apace, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had nothing else to stay for.

<p/>The conclusion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) visit, however, was diversified in a way which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had not at all imagined. Captain Wentworth, after being unseen and
unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days, appeared again among them
to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) away.

<p/>A letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) friend, Captain Harville, having found him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) out at
last, had brought intelligence of Captain Harville's being settled with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) family at Lyme for the winter; of their being therefore, quite
unknowingly, within twenty miles of each other. Captain Harville had
never been in good health since a severe wound which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) received two
years before, and Captain Wentworth's anxiety to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had determined
him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) to go immediately to Lyme. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had been there for four-and-twenty
hours. His (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) acquittal was complete, his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) friendship warmly honoured, a
lively interest excited for his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) friend, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) description of the fine
country about Lyme so feelingly attended to by the party, that an
earnest desire to see Lyme themselves, and a project for going thither
was the consequence.

<p/>The young people were all wild to see Lyme. Captain Wentworth talked
of going there again himself, it was only seventeen miles from
Uppercross; though November, the weather was by no means bad; and, in
short, Louisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed the
resolution to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) liked, being
now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) own way, bore down
all the wishes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) father and mother for putting it off till summer;
and to Lyme they were to go--Charles, Mary, Anne, Henrietta, Louisa,
and Captain Wentworth.

<p/>The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at
night; but to this Mr Musgrove, for the sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) horses, would not
consent; and when it came to be rationally considered, a day in the
middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place,
after deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required, for
going and returning. They were, consequently, to stay the night there,
and not to be expected back till the next day's dinner. This was felt
to be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the Great
House at rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very punctually,
it was so much past noon before the two carriages, Mr Musgrove's coach
containing the four ladies, and Charles's curricle, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) drove
Captain Wentworth, were descending the long hill into Lyme, and
entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself, that it was
very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them,
before the light and warmth of the day were gone.

<p/>After securing accommodations, and ordering a dinner at one of the
inns, the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly
down to the sea. They were come too late in the year for any amusement
or variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer. The rooms were
shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family but of the
residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire in the buildings
themselves, the remarkable situation of the town, the principal street
almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb, skirting round
the pleasant little bay, which, in the season, is animated with bathing
machines and company; the Cobb itself, its old wonders and new
improvements, with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to
the east of the town, are what the stranger's eye will seek; and a very
strange stranger it must be, who does not see charms in the immediate
environs of Lyme, to make him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) wish to know it better. The scenes in
its neighbourhood, Charmouth, with its high grounds and extensive
sweeps of country, and still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by
dark cliffs, where fragments of low rock among the sands, make it the
happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in
unwearied contemplation; the woody varieties of the cheerful village of
Up Lyme; and, above all, Pinny, with its green chasms between romantic
rocks, where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant
growth, declare that many a generation must have passed away since the
first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a
state, where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited, as may
more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed Isle of
Wight: these places must be visited, and visited again, to make the
worth of Lyme understood.

<p/>The party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted and
melancholy looking rooms, and still descending, soon found themselves
on the sea-shore; and lingering only, as all must linger and gaze on a
first return to the sea, who ever deserved to look on it at all,
proceeded towards the Cobb, equally their object in itself and on
Captain Wentworth's account: for in a small house, near the foot of an
old pier of unknown date, were the Harvilles settled. Captain
Wentworth turned in to call on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) friend; the others walked on, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
was to join them on the Cobb.

<p/>They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not even
Louisa seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long,
when they saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) coming after them, with three companions, all well
known already, by description, to be Captain and Mrs Harville, and a
Captain Benwick, who was staying with them.

<p/>Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia;
and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) return
from Lyme before, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) warm praise of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) as an excellent young man and
an officer, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had always valued highly, which must have stamped
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) well in the esteem of every listener, had been followed by a little
history of his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) private life, which rendered him (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) perfectly interesting
in the eyes of all the ladies. He (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) had been engaged to Captain
Harville's sister, and was now mourning her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) loss. They had been a year
or two waiting for fortune and promotion. Fortune came, his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
prize-money as lieutenant being great; promotion, too, came at last;
but Fanny Harville did not live to know it. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had died the preceding
summer while he (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) was at sea. Captain Wentworth believed it impossible
for man to be more attached to woman than poor Benwick had been to
Fanny Harville, or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful
change. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) considered his (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) disposition as of the sort which must suffer
heavily, uniting very strong feelings with quiet, serious, and retiring
manners, and a decided taste for reading, and sedentary pursuits. To
finish the interest of the story, the friendship between him (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) and the
Harvilles seemed, if possible, augmented by the event which closed all
their views of alliance, and Captain Benwick was now living with them
entirely. Captain Harville had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) present house for half a
year; his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) taste, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) health, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) fortune, all directing him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) to
a residence inexpensive, and by the sea; and the grandeur of the
country, and the retirement of Lyme in the winter, appeared exactly
adapted to Captain Benwick's state of mind. The sympathy and good-will
excited towards Captain Benwick was very great.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Anne to herself, as they now moved forward to meet the
party, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart than I have. I
cannot believe his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) prospects so blighted for ever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) is younger than
I am; younger in feeling, if not in fact; younger as a man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will
rally again, and be happy with another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div><p/>They all met, and were introduced. Captain Harville was a tall, dark
man, with a sensible, benevolent countenance; a little lame; and from
strong features and want of health, looking much older than Captain
Wentworth. Captain Benwick looked, and was, the youngest of the three,
and, compared with either of them, a little man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a pleasing
face and a melancholy air, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to have, and drew back from
conversation.

<p/>Captain Harville, though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners,
was a perfect gentleman, unaffected, warm, and obliging. Mrs Harville,
a degree less polished than her (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) husband, seemed, however, to have the
same good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant than their
desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own, because
the friends of Captain Wentworth, or more kindly hospitable than their
entreaties for their all promising to dine with them. The dinner,
already ordered at the inn, was at last, though unwillingly, accepted
as a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth should
have brought any such party to Lyme, without considering it as a thing
of course that they should dine with them.

<p/>There was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this, and such
a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon, so unlike
the usual style of give-and-take invitations, and dinners of formality
and display, that Anne felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) spirits not likely to be benefited by
an increasing acquaintance among his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) brother-officers. <div class="bookquote">``These would
have been all my friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thought; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had to struggle
against a great tendency to lowness.

<p/>On quitting the Cobb, they all went in-doors with their new friends,
and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart
could think capable of accommodating so many. Anne had a moment's
astonishment on the subject herself; but it was soon lost in the
pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious
contrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville, to turn the
actual space to the best account, to supply the deficiencies of
lodging-house furniture, and defend the windows and doors against the
winter storms to be expected. The varieties in the fitting-up of the
rooms, where the common necessaries provided by the owner, in the
common indifferent plight, were contrasted with some few articles of a
rare species of wood, excellently worked up, and with something curious
and valuable from all the distant countries Captain Harville had
visited, were more than amusing to Anne; connected as it all was with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) profession, the fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) habits, the picture of repose and domestic happiness it
presented, made it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) a something more, or less, than gratification.

<p/>Captain Harville was no reader; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) had contrived excellent
accommodations, and fashioned very pretty shelves, for a tolerable
collection of well-bound volumes, the property of Captain Benwick. His (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
lameness prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) from taking much exercise; but a mind of
usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) with constant employment
within. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) drew, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) varnished, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) carpentered, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) glued; he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) made toys
for the children; he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) fashioned new netting-needles and pins with
improvements; and if everything else was done, sat down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) large
fishing-net at one corner of the room.

<p/>Anne thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) left great happiness behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) when they quitted the
house; and Louisa, by whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found herself walking, burst forth into
raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy; their
friendliness, their brotherliness, their openness, their uprightness;
protesting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was convinced of sailors having more worth and
warmth than any other set of men in England; that they only knew how to
live, and they only deserved to be respected and loved.

<p/>They went back to dress and dine; and so well had the scheme answered
already, that nothing was found amiss; though its being <div class="bookquote">``so entirely
out of season,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>and the <div class="bookquote">``no thoroughfare of Lyme,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>and the <div class="bookquote">``no
expectation of company,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>had brought many apologies from the heads of
the inn.

<p/>Anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to being
in Captain Wentworth's company than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had at first imagined could
ever be, that the sitting down to the same table with him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) now, and the
interchange of the common civilities attending on it -LRB-they never got
beyond-RRB-, was become a mere nothing.

<p/>The nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow,
but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>)
came, bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) friend also, which was more than had been expected,
it having been agreed that Captain Benwick had all the appearance of
being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) ventured
among them again, however, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) spirits certainly did not seem
fit for the mirth of the party in general.

<p/>While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the
room, and by recurring to former days, supplied anecdotes in abundance
to occupy and entertain the others, it fell to Anne's lot to be placed
rather apart with Captain Benwick; and a very good impulse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
nature obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to begin an acquaintance with him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was shy, and
disposed to abstraction; but the engaging mildness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) countenance,
and gentleness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) manners, soon had their effect; and Anne was well
repaid the first trouble of exertion. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was evidently a young man of
considerable taste in reading, though principally in poetry; and
besides the persuasion of having given him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) at least an evening's
indulgence in the discussion of subjects, which his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) usual companions
had probably no concern in, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had the hope of being of real use to
him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling
against affliction, which had naturally grown out of their
conversation. For, though shy, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) did not seem reserved; it had rather
the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints; and
having talked of poetry, the richness of the present age, and gone
through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first-rate poets,
trying to ascertain whether Marmion or The Lady of the Lake were to be
preferred, and how ranked the Giaour and The Bride of Abydos; and
moreover, how the Giaour was to be pronounced, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) showed himself so
intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet, and
all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other; he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>)
repeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various lines which imaged a
broken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness, and looked so
entirely as if he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) meant to be understood, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bride</b></font>) ventured to hope he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>)
did not always read only poetry, and to say, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bride</b></font>) thought it was
the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who
enjoyed it completely; and that the strong feelings which alone could
estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but
sparingly.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) looks shewing him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) not pained, but pleased with this allusion to his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>)
situation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bride</b></font>) was emboldened to go on; and feeling in herself the
right of seniority of mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bride</b></font>) ventured to recommend a larger
allowance of prose in his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) daily study; and on being requested to
particularize, mentioned such works of our best moralists, such
collections of the finest letters, such memoirs of characters of worth
and suffering, as occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bride</b></font>) at the moment as calculated to rouse
and fortify the mind by the highest precepts, and the strongest
examples of moral and religious endurances.

<p/>Captain Benwick listened attentively, and seemed grateful for the
interest implied; and though with a shake of the head, and sighs which
declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like
his (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>), noted down the names of those she (<font color='blue'><b>Bride</b></font>) recommended, and promised to
procure and read them.

<p/>When the evening was over, Anne could not but be amused at the idea of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had never seen before; nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) help fearing, on more
serious reflection, that, like many other great moralists and
preachers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been eloquent on a point in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own conduct
would ill bear examination.



<p/>Chapter 12


<p/>Anne and Henrietta, finding themselves the earliest of the party the
next morning, agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast. They
went to the sands, to watch the flowing of the tide, which a fine
south-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which so
flat a shore admitted. They praised the morning; gloried in the sea;
sympathized in the delight of the fresh-feeling breeze--and were
silent; till Henrietta suddenly began again with--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes,--I am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions, the
sea-air always does good. There can be no doubt of its having been of
the greatest service to Dr Shirley, after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) illness, last spring
twelve-month. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) declares himself, that coming to Lyme for a month,
did him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) more good than all the medicine he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took; and, that being by the
sea, always makes him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feel young again. Now, I cannot help thinking it
a pity that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not live entirely by the sea. I do think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
better leave Uppercross entirely, and fix at Lyme. Do not you, Anne?
Do not you agree with me, that it is the best thing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could do, both
for himself and Mrs Shirley? She (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) has cousins here, you know, and many
acquaintance, which would make it cheerful for her (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>), and I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>)
would be glad to get to a place where she (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) could have medical attendance
at hand, in case of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) having another seizure. Indeed I think it
quite melancholy to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley,
who have been doing good all their lives, wearing out their last days
in a place like Uppercross, where, excepting our family, they seem shut
out from all the world. I wish his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) friends would propose it to him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>). I
really think they ought. And, as to procuring a dispensation, there
could be no difficulty at his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) time of life, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) character. My
only doubt is, whether anything could persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) parish.
He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) is so very strict and scrupulous in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) notions; over-scrupulous I
must say. Do not you think, Anne, it is being over-scrupulous? Do not
you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience, when a clergyman
sacrifices his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) health for the sake of duties, which may be just as well
performed by another person? And at Lyme too, only seventeen miles
off, he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) would be near enough to hear, if people thought there was
anything to complain of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech, and entered
into the subject, as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of
a young lady as of a young man, though here it was good of a lower
standard, for what could be offered but general acquiescence? She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said
all that was reasonable and proper on the business; felt the claims of
Dr Shirley to repose as she (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) ought; saw how very desirable it was that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have some active, respectable young man, as a resident
curate, and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such
resident curate's being married.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)</div>said Henrietta, very well pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) companion, <div class="bookquote">``I wish
Lady Russell lived at Uppercross, and were intimate with Dr Shirley. I
have always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of the greatest influence
with everybody! I always look upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) as able to persuade a person to
anything! I am afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>), as I have told you before, quite afraid
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>), because she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) is so very clever; but I respect her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) amazingly, and
wish we had such a neighbour at Uppercross.''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne was amused by Henrietta's manner of being grateful, and amused
also that the course of events and the new interests of Henrietta's
views should have placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) friend at all in favour with any of the
Musgrove family; she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had only time, however, for a general answer, and
a wish that such another woman were at Uppercross, before all subjects
suddenly ceased, on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards
them. They came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be
ready; but Louisa recollecting, immediately afterwards that she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) had
something to procure at a shop, invited them all to go back with her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>)
into the town. They were all at her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) disposal.

<p/>When they came to the steps, leading upwards from the beach, a
gentleman, at the same moment preparing to come down, politely drew
back, and stopped to give them way. They ascended and passed him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>); and
as they passed, Anne's face caught his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eye, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) with a
degree of earnest admiration, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not be insensible of.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was looking remarkably well; her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) very regular, very pretty
features, having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine
wind which had been blowing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) complexion, and by the animation of
eye which it had also produced. It was evident that the gentleman,
-LRB-completely a gentleman in manner-RRB- admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) exceedingly. Captain
Wentworth looked round at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) instantly in a way which shewed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
noticing of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) a momentary glance, a glance of
brightness, which seemed to say, <div class="bookquote">``That man is struck with you, and even
I, at this moment, see something like Anne Elliot again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>After attending Louisa through her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) business, and loitering about a
little longer, they returned to the inn; and Anne, in passing
afterwards quickly from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own chamber to their dining-room, had
nearly run against the very same gentleman, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) came out of an
adjoining apartment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had before conjectured him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to be a stranger
like themselves, and determined that a well-looking groom, who was
strolling about near the two inns as they came back, should be his (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>)
servant. Both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea. It
was now proved that he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) belonged to the same inn as themselves; and this
second meeting, short as it was, also proved again by the gentleman's
looks, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) thought hers very lovely, and by the readiness and
propriety of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) apologies, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a man of exceedingly good
manners. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) seemed about thirty, and though not handsome, had an
agreeable person. Anne felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) should like to know who he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was.

<p/>They had nearly done breakfast, when the sound of a carriage, -LRB-almost
the first they had heard since entering Lyme-RRB- drew half the party to
the window. It was a gentleman's carriage, a curricle, but only coming
round from the stable-yard to the front door; somebody must be going
away. It was driven by a servant in mourning.

<p/>The word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) might compare
it with his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) own; the servant in mourning roused Anne's curiosity, and
the whole six were collected to look, by the time the owner of the
curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and
civilities of the household, and taking his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) seat, to drive off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>cried Captain Wentworth, instantly, and with half a glance at
Anne, <div class="bookquote">``it is the very man we passed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>The Miss Musgroves agreed to it; and having all kindly watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) as
far up the hill as they could, they returned to the breakfast table.
The waiter came into the room soon afterwards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain Wentworth, immediately, <div class="bookquote">``can you tell us the name
of the gentleman who is just gone away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wentworth/Mr Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Sir, a Mr Elliot, a gentleman of large fortune, came in last
night from Sidmouth. Dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you
were at dinner; and going on now for Crewkherne, in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) way to Bath and
London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Elliot!''  (<font color='red'><b>a waiter</b></font>)</div>Many had looked on each other, and many had repeated the
name, before all this had been got through, even by the smart rapidity
of a waiter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>cried Mary; <div class="bookquote">``it must be our cousin; it must be our Mr
Elliot, it must, indeed! Charles, Anne, must not it? In mourning, you
see, just as our Mr Elliot must be. How very extraordinary! In the
very same inn with us! Anne, must not it be our Mr Elliot? my
father's next heir? Pray sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>turning to the waiter, <div class="bookquote">``did not you
hear, did not his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) servant say whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) belonged to the Kellynch
family?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, ma'am, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) did not mention no particular family; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) said his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
master was a very rich gentleman, and would be a baronight some day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There! you see!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>cried Mary in an ecstasy, <div class="bookquote">``just as I said! Heir to
Sir Walter Elliot! I was sure that would come out, if it was so.
Depend upon it, that is a circumstance which his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) servants take care to
publish, wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) goes. But, Anne, only conceive how extraordinary!
I wish I had looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) more. I wish we had been aware in time, who
it was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) might have been introduced to us. What a pity that we
should not have been introduced to each other! Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had the
Elliot countenance? I hardly looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), I was looking at the
horses; but I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had something of the Elliot countenance, I
wonder the arms did not strike me! Oh! the great-coat was hanging over
the panel, and hid the arms, so it did; otherwise, I am sure, I should
have observed them, and the livery too; if the servant had not been in
mourning, one should have known him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) by the livery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said
Captain Wentworth, <div class="bookquote">``we must consider it to be the arrangement of
Providence, that you should not be introduced to your cousin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wentworth/Mr Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could command Mary's attention, Anne quietly tried to convince
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) that their father and Mr Elliot had not, for many years, been on
such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all
desirable.

<p/>At the same time, however, it was a secret gratification to herself to
have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) cousin, and to know that the future owner of Kellynch was
undoubtedly a gentleman, and had an air of good sense. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would not,
upon any account, mention her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) having met with him (<font color='blue'><b>Kellynch</b></font>) the second time;
luckily Mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him (<font color='blue'><b>Kellynch</b></font>) in
their earlier walk, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would have felt quite ill-used by Anne's
having actually run against him (<font color='blue'><b>Kellynch</b></font>) in the passage, and received his (<font color='blue'><b>Kellynch</b></font>) very
polite excuses, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had never been near him (<font color='blue'><b>Kellynch</b></font>) at all; no, that
cousinly little interview must remain a perfect secret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot, the
next time you write to Bath. I think my father certainly ought to hear
of it; do mention all about him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne avoided a direct reply, but it was just the circumstance which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated, but as what
ought to be suppressed. The offence which had been given her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father,
many years back, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew; Elizabeth's particular share in it she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
suspected; and that Mr Elliot's idea always produced irritation in both
was beyond a doubt. Mary never wrote to Bath herself; all the toil of
keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth fell
on Anne.

<p/>Breakfast had not been long over, when they were joined by Captain and
Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick; with whom they had appointed to take
their last walk about Lyme. They ought to be setting off for
Uppercross by one, and in the meanwhile were to be all together, and
out of doors as long as they could.

<p/>Anne found Captain Benwick getting near her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), as soon as they were all
fairly in the street. Their conversation the preceding evening did not
disincline him (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) to seek her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) again; and they walked together some time,
talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron, and still as unable as
before, and as unable as any other two readers, to think exactly alike
of the merits of either, till something occasioned an almost general
change amongst their party, and instead of Captain Benwick, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had
Captain Harville by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Elliot,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), speaking rather low, <div class="bookquote">``you have done a good deed
in making that poor fellow talk so much. I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could have such
company oftener. It is bad for him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), I know, to be shut up as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is;
but what can we do? We cannot part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Anne, <div class="bookquote">``that I can easily believe to be impossible; but in
time, perhaps--we know what time does in every case of affliction, and
you must remember, Captain Harville, that your friend may yet be called
a young mourner--only last summer, I understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, true enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-with a deep sigh-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``only June.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And not known to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>), perhaps, so soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not till the first week of August, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) came home from the Cape,
just made into the Grappler. I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) sent in letters, but the Grappler was under orders for
Portsmouth. There the news must follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>), but who was to tell it?
not I. I would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm. Nobody could
do it, but that good fellow''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>-LRB-pointing to Captain Wentworth.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``The
Laconia had come into Plymouth the week before; no danger of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) being
sent to sea again. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) stood his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) chance for the rest; wrote up for
leave of absence, but without waiting the return, travelled night and
day till he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) got to Portsmouth, rowed off to the Grappler that instant,
and never left the poor fellow for a week. That's what he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) did, and
nobody else could have saved poor James. You may think, Miss Elliot,
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) is dear to us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as much
in reply as her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own feeling could accomplish, or as his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) seemed able to
bear, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was too much affected to renew the subject, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
spoke again, it was of something totally different.

<p/>Mrs Harville's giving it as her (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) opinion that her (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) husband would have
quite walking enough by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) reached home, determined the
direction of all the party in what was to be their last walk; they
would accompany them to their door, and then return and set off
themselves. By all their calculations there was just time for this;
but as they drew near the Cobb, there was such a general wish to walk
along it once more, all were so inclined, and Louisa soon grew so
determined, that the difference of a quarter of an hour, it was found,
would be no difference at all; so with all the kind leave-taking, and
all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be
imagined, they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville at their own door,
and still accompanied by Captain Benwick, who seemed to cling to them
to the last, proceeded to make the proper adieus to the Cobb.

<p/>Anne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Lord Byron's <div class="bookquote">``dark
blue seas''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Byron</b></font>)</div>could not fail of being brought forward by their present
view, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) gladly gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) all her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) attention as long as attention
was possible. It was soon drawn, perforce another way.

<p/>There was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant
for the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower, and
all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight,
excepting Louisa; she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth.
In all their walks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had had to jump her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) from the stiles; the
sensation was delightful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>). The hardness of the pavement for her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>)
feet, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) less willing upon the present occasion; he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) did it,
however. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) was safely down, and instantly, to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) enjoyment,
ran up the steps to be jumped down again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) against it,
thought the jar too great; but no, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) reasoned and talked in vain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>)
smiled and said, <div class="bookquote">``I am determined I will:''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) hands; she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>)
was too precipitate by half a second, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) fell on the pavement on the
Lower Cobb, and was taken up lifeless! There was no wound, no blood,
no visible bruise; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) eyes were closed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) breathed not, her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) face
was like death. The horror of the moment to all who stood around!

<p/>Captain Wentworth, who had caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) up, knelt with her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) arms,
looking on her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) with a face as pallid as her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) own, in an agony of
silence. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is dead! she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>screamed Mary, catching hold of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) husband, and contributing with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own horror to make him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
immoveable; and in another moment, Henrietta, sinking under the
conviction, lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) senses too, and would have fallen on the steps,
but for Captain Benwick and Anne, who caught and supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) between
them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there no one to help me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>were the first words which burst from
Captain Wentworth, in a tone of despair, and as if all his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) own strength
were gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), go to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>cried Anne, <div class="bookquote">``for heaven's sake go to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>). I
can support her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) myself. Leave me, and go to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>). Rub her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) hands, rub
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) temples; here are salts; take them, take them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Captain Benwick obeyed, and Charles at the same moment, disengaging
himself from his (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) wife, they were both with him (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>); and Louisa was raised
up and supported more firmly between them, and everything was done that
Anne had prompted, but in vain; while Captain Wentworth, staggering
against the wall for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) support, exclaimed in the bitterest agony--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh God! her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) father and mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wentworth/Mr Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A surgeon!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) caught the word; it seemed to rouse him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) at once, and saying only--
<div class="bookquote">``True, true, a surgeon this instant,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>was darting away, when Anne
eagerly suggested--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain Benwick, would not it be better for Captain Benwick? He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) knows
where a surgeon is to be found.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea, and in a
moment -LRB-it was all done in rapid moments-RRB- Captain Benwick had resigned
the poor corpse-like figure entirely to the brother's care, and was
off for the town with the utmost rapidity.

<p/>As to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said which
of the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most: Captain
Wentworth, Anne, or Charles, who, really a very affectionate brother,
hung over Louisa with sobs of grief, and could only turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) eyes from
one sister, to see the other in a state as insensible, or to witness
the hysterical agitations of his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) wife, calling on him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) for help which he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>)
could not give.

<p/>Anne, attending with all the strength and zeal, and thought, which
instinct supplied, to Henrietta, still tried, at intervals, to suggest
comfort to the others, tried to quiet Mary, to animate Charles, to
assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth. Both seemed to look to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
for directions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anne, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>cried Charles, <div class="bookquote">``What is to be done next? What, in
heaven's name, is to be done next?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div><p/>Captain Wentworth's eyes were also turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Had not she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) better be carried to the inn? Yes, I am sure: carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
gently to the inn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, to the inn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>repeated Captain Wentworth, comparatively
collected, and eager to be doing something. <div class="bookquote">``I will carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) myself.
Musgrove, take care of the others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the workmen boatmen</b></font>)</div><p/>By this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen
and boatmen about the Cobb, and many were collected near them, to be
useful if wanted, at any rate, to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady,
nay, two dead young ladies, for it proved twice as fine as the first
report. To some of the best-looking of these good people Henrietta was
consigned, for, though partially revived, she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) was quite helpless; and
in this manner, Anne walking by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) side, and Charles attending to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cobb</b></font>)
wife, they set forward, treading back with feelings unutterable, the
ground, which so lately, so very lately, and so light of heart, they
had passed along.

<p/>They were not off the Cobb, before the Harvilles met them. Captain
Benwick had been seen flying by their house, with a countenance which
showed something to be wrong; and they had set off immediately,
informed and directed as they passed, towards the spot. Shocked as
Captain Harville was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) brought senses and nerves that could be
instantly useful; and a look between him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) wife decided what was
to be done. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) must be taken to their house; all must go to their
house; and await the surgeon's arrival there. They would not listen to
scruples: he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) was obeyed; they were all beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) roof; and while
Louisa, under Mrs Harville's direction, was conveyed up stairs, and
given possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) own bed, assistance, cordials, restoratives
were supplied by her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) husband to all who needed them.

<p/>Louisa had once opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) eyes, but soon closed them again, without
apparent consciousness. This had been a proof of life, however, of
service to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) sister; and Henrietta, though perfectly incapable of
being in the same room with Louisa, was kept, by the agitation of hope
and fear, from a return of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) own insensibility. Mary, too, was
growing calmer.

<p/>The surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible. They
were sick with horror, while he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) examined; but he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) was not hopeless. The
head had received a severe contusion, but he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) had seen greater injuries
recovered from: he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) was by no means hopeless; he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) spoke cheerfully.

<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) did not regard it as a desperate case, that he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) did not say a
few hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most; and
the ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent, after a
few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered, may
be conceived.

<p/>The tone, the look, with which <div class="bookquote">``Thank God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>was uttered by Captain
Wentworth, Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>); nor the sight
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) afterwards, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) sat near a table, leaning over it with folded
arms and face concealed, as if overpowered by the various feelings of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) soul, and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them.

<p/>Louisa's limbs had escaped. There was no injury but to the head.

<p/>It now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be
done, as to their general situation. They were now able to speak to
each other and consult. That Louisa must remain where she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) was, however
distressing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) friends to be involving the Harvilles in such
trouble, did not admit a doubt. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) removal was impossible. The
Harvilles silenced all scruples; and, as much as they could, all
gratitude. They had looked forward and arranged everything before the
others began to reflect. Captain Benwick must give up his (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) room to
them, and get another bed elsewhere; and the whole was settled. They
were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more; and yet
perhaps, by <div class="bookquote">``putting the children away in the maid's room, or swinging
a cot somewhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Musgrove</b></font>)</div>they could hardly bear to think of not finding room
for two or three besides, supposing they might wish to stay; though,
with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove, there need not be the
least uneasiness in leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) to Mrs Harville's care entirely. Mrs
Harville was a very experienced nurse, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) nursery-maid, who had
lived with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) long, and gone about with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) everywhere, was just such
another. Between these two, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) could want no possible attendance by
day or night. And all this was said with a truth and sincerity of
feeling irresistible.

<p/>Charles, Henrietta, and Captain Wentworth were the three in
consultation, and for a little while it was only an interchange of
perplexity and terror. <div class="bookquote">``Uppercross, the necessity of some one's going
to Uppercross; the news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to Mr
and Mrs Musgrove; the lateness of the morning; an hour already gone
since they ought to have been off; the impossibility of being in
tolerable time.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>At first, they were capable of nothing more to the
purpose than such exclamations; but, after a while, Captain Wentworth,
exerting himself, said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must be decided, and without the loss of another minute. Every
minute is valuable. Some one must resolve on being off for Uppercross
instantly. Musgrove, either you or I must go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wentworth/Mr Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles agreed, but declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) resolution of not going away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville;
but as to leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) sister in such a state, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) neither ought, nor
would. So far it was decided; and Henrietta at first declared the
same. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>), however, was soon persuaded to think differently. The
usefulness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) staying! She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) who had not been able to remain in
Louisa's room, or to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>), without sufferings which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>)
worse than helpless! She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) was forced to acknowledge that she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) could do
no good, yet was still unwilling to be away, till, touched by the
thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) father and mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) gave it up; she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) consented, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>)
was anxious to be at home.

<p/>The plan had reached this point, when Anne, coming quietly down from
Louisa's room, could not but hear what followed, for the parlour door
was open.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it is settled, Musgrove,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>cried Captain Wentworth, <div class="bookquote">``that you
stay, and that I take care of your sister home. But as to the rest, as
to the others, if one stays to assist Mrs Harville, I think it need be
only one. Mrs Charles Musgrove will, of course, wish to get back to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) children; but if Anne will stay, no one so proper, so capable as
Anne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wentworth/Mr Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself so
spoken of. The other two warmly agreed with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) then
appeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and nurse her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>);''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>),
turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) and speaking with a glow, and yet a gentleness, which
seemed almost restoring the past. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) coloured deeply, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
recollected himself and moved away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) expressed herself most
willing, ready, happy to remain. <div class="bookquote">``It was what she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had been thinking
of, and wishing to be allowed to do. A bed on the floor in Louisa's
room would be sufficient for her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>), if Mrs Harville would but think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>One thing more, and all seemed arranged. Though it was rather
desirable that Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some
share of delay; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses to take
them back, would be a dreadful extension of suspense; and Captain
Wentworth proposed, and Charles Musgrove agreed, that it would be much
better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) to take a chaise from the inn, and leave Mr Musgrove's
carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early, when there
would be the farther advantage of sending an account of Louisa's night.

<p/>Captain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) part,
and to be soon followed by the two ladies. When the plan was made
known to Mary, however, there was an end of all peace in it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was
so wretched and so vehement, complained so much of injustice in being
expected to go away instead of Anne; Anne, who was nothing to Louisa,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) sister, and had the best right to stay in Henrietta's
stead! Why was not she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) to be as useful as Anne? And to go home
without Charles, too, without her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) husband! No, it was too unkind. And
in short, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) husband could long withstand, and as
none of the others could oppose when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) gave way, there was no help for
it; the change of Mary for Anne was inevitable.

<p/>Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and
ill-judging claims of Mary; but so it must be, and they set off for the
town, Charles taking care of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sister, and Captain Benwick attending
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) gave a moment's recollection, as they hurried along, to
the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in
the morning. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had listened to Henrietta's schemes for Dr
Shirley's leaving Uppercross; farther on, she (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) had first seen Mr Elliot;
a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa, or
those who were wrapt up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) welfare.

<p/>Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>); and, united as
they all seemed by the distress of the day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) felt an increasing
degree of good-will towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>), and a pleasure even in thinking that
it might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance.

<p/>Captain Wentworth was on the watch for them, and a chaise and four in
waiting, stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the
street; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of
one sister for the other, the change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) countenance, the
astonishment, the expressions begun and suppressed, with which Charles
was listened to, made but a mortifying reception of Anne; or must at
least convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was valued only as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could be useful to
Louisa.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) endeavoured to be composed, and to be just. Without emulating the
feelings of an Emma towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) Henry, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would have attended on
Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sake; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would not long be so unjust as to suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would shrink
unnecessarily from the office of a friend.

<p/>In the meanwhile she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was in the carriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had handed them both in,
and placed himself between them; and in this manner, under these
circumstances, full of astonishment and emotion to Anne, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) quitted
Lyme. How the long stage would pass; how it was to affect their
manners; what was to be their sort of intercourse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not
foresee. It was all quite natural, however. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was devoted to
Henrietta; always turning towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>); and when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) spoke at all, always
with the view of supporting her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) hopes and raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) spirits. In
general, his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) voice and manner were studiously calm. To spare Henrietta
from agitation seemed the governing principle. Once only, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) had
been grieving over the last ill-judged, ill-fated walk to the Cobb,
bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cobb</b></font>) burst forth, as
if wholly overcome--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk of it, don't talk of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cobb</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Oh God! that I had
not given way to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) at the fatal moment! Had I done as I ought! But
so eager and so resolute! Dear, sweet Louisa!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cobb</b></font>) now, to question the
justness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cobb</b></font>) own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and
advantage of firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Cobb</b></font>)
that, like all other qualities of the mind, it should have its
proportions and limits. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thought it could scarcely escape him (<font color='blue'><b>Cobb</b></font>) to
feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of
happiness as a very resolute character.

<p/>They got on fast. Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills and
the same objects so soon. Their actual speed, heightened by some dread
of the conclusion, made the road appear but half as long as on the day
before. It was growing quite dusk, however, before they were in the
neighbourhood of Uppercross, and there had been total silence among
them for some time, Henrietta leaning back in the corner, with a shawl
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) face, giving the hope of her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) having cried herself to sleep;
when, as they were going up their last hill, Anne found herself all at
once addressed by Captain Wentworth. In a low, cautious voice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
said:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been considering what we had best do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) must not appear at
first. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) could not stand it. I have been thinking whether you had
not better remain in the carriage with her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>), while I go in and break it
to Mr and Mrs Musgrove. Do you think this is a good plan?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did: he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was satisfied, and said no more. But the remembrance of
the appeal remained a pleasure to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), as a proof of friendship, and of
deference for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) judgement, a great pleasure; and when it became a
sort of parting proof, its value did not lessen.

<p/>When the distressing communication at Uppercross was over, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had
seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped, and the
daughter all the better for being with them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) announced his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) intention
of returning in the same carriage to Lyme; and when the horses were
baited, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was off.

<p/>Chapter 13


<p/>The remainder of Anne's time at Uppercross, comprehending only two
days, was spent entirely at the Mansion House; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had the
satisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there, both as an
immediate companion, and as assisting in all those arrangements for the
future, which, in Mr and Mrs Musgrove's distressed state of spirits,
would have been difficulties.

<p/>They had an early account from Lyme the next morning. Louisa was much
the same. No symptoms worse than before had appeared. Charles came a
few hours afterwards, to bring a later and more particular account. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>)
was tolerably cheerful. A speedy cure must not be hoped, but
everything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted. In
speaking of the Harvilles, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) seemed unable to satisfy his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) own sense of
their kindness, especially of Mrs Harville's exertions as a nurse.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) really left nothing for Mary to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) and Mary had been
persuaded to go early to their inn last night. Mary had been
hysterical again this morning. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) came away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was going to
walk out with Captain Benwick, which, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) hoped, would do her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) good. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
almost wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been prevailed on to come home the day before;
but the truth was, that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) father had at
first half a mind to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>), but the ladies could not consent. It
would be going only to multiply trouble to the others, and increase his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>)
own distress; and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon. A
chaise was sent for from Crewkherne, and Charles conveyed back a far
more useful person in the old nursery-maid of the family, one who
having brought up all the children, and seen the very last, the
lingering and long-petted Master Harry, sent to school after his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
brothers, was now living in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) deserted nursery to mend stockings and
dress all the blains and bruises she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could get near her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and who,
consequently, was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse
dear Miss Louisa. Vague wishes of getting Sarah thither, had occurred
before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta; but without Anne, it would hardly
have been resolved on, and found practicable so soon.

<p/>They were indebted, the next day, to Charles Hayter, for all the minute
knowledge of Louisa, which it was so essential to obtain every
twenty-four hours. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) made it his (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) business to go to Lyme, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>)
account was still encouraging. The intervals of sense and
consciousness were believed to be stronger. Every report agreed in
Captain Wentworth's appearing fixed in Lyme.

<p/>Anne was to leave them on the morrow, an event which they all dreaded.
<div class="bookquote">``What should they do without her (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>)? They were wretched comforters for
one another.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>And so much was said in this way, that Anne thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was privy, and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
had little difficulty; it was soon determined that they would go; go
to-morrow, fix themselves at the inn, or get into lodgings, as it
suited, and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved. They must be
taking off some trouble from the good people she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) was with; they might
at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) own children; and in
short, they were so happy in the decision, that Anne was delighted with
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had done, and felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not spend her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) last morning
at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations, and sending
them off at an early hour, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) being left to the solitary range
of the house was the consequence.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was the last, excepting the little boys at the cottage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was the
very last, the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated
both houses, of all that had given Uppercross its cheerful character.
A few days had made a change indeed!

<p/>If Louisa recovered, it would all be well again. More than former
happiness would be restored. There could not be a doubt, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) mind
there was none, of what would follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) recovery. A few months hence,
and the room now so deserted, occupied but by her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) silent, pensive self,
might be filled again with all that was happy and gay, all that was
glowing and bright in prosperous love, all that was most unlike Anne
Elliot!

<p/>An hour's complete leisure for such reflections as these, on a dark
November day, a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few
objects ever to be discerned from the windows, was enough to make the
sound of Lady Russell's carriage exceedingly welcome; and yet, though
desirous to be gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) could not quit the Mansion House, or look an
adieu to the Cottage, with its black, dripping and comfortless veranda,
or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of
the village, without a saddened heart. Scenes had passed in Uppercross
which made it precious. It stood the record of many sensations of
pain, once severe, but now softened; and of some instances of relenting
feeling, some breathings of friendship and reconciliation, which could
never be looked for again, and which could never cease to be dear. She (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>)
left it all behind her (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>), all but the recollection that such things had
been.

<p/>Anne had never entered Kellynch since her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) quitting Lady Russell's house
in September. It had not been necessary, and the few occasions of its
being possible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to go to the Hall she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had contrived to evade and
escape from. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) first return was to resume her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) place in the modern
and elegant apartments of the Lodge, and to gladden the eyes of its
mistress.

<p/>There was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell's joy in meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) knew who had been frequenting Uppercross. But happily, either Anne
was improved in plumpness and looks, or Lady Russell fancied her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) so;
and Anne, in receiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) compliments on the occasion, had the
amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) cousin,
and of hoping that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was to be blessed with a second spring of youth
and beauty.

<p/>When they came to converse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was soon sensible of some mental
change. The subjects of which her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heart had been full on leaving
Kellynch, and which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had felt slighted, and been compelled to
smother among the Musgroves, were now become but of secondary interest.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had lately lost sight even of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father and sister and Bath.
Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross; and when Lady
Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears, and spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>)
satisfaction in the house in Camden Place, which had been taken, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) regret that Mrs Clay should still be with them, Anne would have
been ashamed to have it known how much more she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was thinking of Lyme
and Louisa Musgrove, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) acquaintance there; how much more
interesting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and
Captain Benwick, than her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) own father's house in Camden Place, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)
own sister's intimacy with Mrs Clay. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) was actually forced to exert
herself to meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal
solicitude, on topics which had by nature the first claim on her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>).

<p/>There was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another
subject. They must speak of the accident at Lyme. Lady Russell had
not been arrived five minutes the day before, when a full account of
the whole had burst on her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>); but still it must be talked of, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) must
make enquiries, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) must regret the imprudence, lament the result, and
Captain Wentworth's name must be mentioned by both. Anne was conscious
of not doing it so well as Lady Russell. She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) could not speak the name,
and look straight forward to Lady Russell's eye, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had adopted
the expedient of telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) briefly what she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) thought of the attachment
between him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) and Louisa. When this was told, his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) name distressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) no
longer.

<p/>Lady Russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy, but
internally her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt,
that the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat of
the value of an Anne Elliot, should, eight years afterwards, be charmed
by a Louisa Musgrove.

<p/>The first three or four days passed most quietly, with no circumstance
to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme, which
found their way to Anne, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not tell how, and brought a rather
improving account of Louisa. At the end of that period, Lady Russell's
politeness could repose no longer, and the fainter self-threatenings of
the past became in a decided tone, <div class="bookquote">``I must call on Mrs Croft; I really
must call upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) soon. Anne, have you courage to go with me, and pay
a visit in that house? It will be some trial to us both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Russell</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne did not shrink from it; on the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) truly felt as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
said, in observing--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two; your
feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine. By remaining in
the neighbourhood, I am become inured to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could have said more on the subject; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had in fact so high an
opinion of the Crofts, and considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father so very fortunate in
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tenants, felt the parish to be so sure of a good example, and the
poor of the best attention and relief, that however sorry and ashamed
for the necessity of the removal, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not but in conscience feel
that they were gone who deserved not to stay, and that Kellynch Hall
had passed into better hands than its owners'. These convictions must
unquestionably have their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they
precluded that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the
house again, and returning through the well-known apartments.

<p/>In such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself, <div class="bookquote">``These rooms
ought to belong only to us. Oh, how fallen in their destination! How
unworthily occupied! An ancient family to be so driven away!
Strangers filling their place!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>No, except when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
mother, and remembered where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been used to sit and preside, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
had no sigh of that description to heave.

<p/>Mrs Croft always met her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) with a kindness which gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) the pleasure of
fancying herself a favourite, and on the present occasion, receiving
her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) in that house, there was particular attention.

<p/>The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic, and on
comparing their latest accounts of the invalid, it appeared that each
lady dated her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn; that
Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday -LRB-the first time since
the accident-RRB-, had brought Anne the last note, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had not been
able to trace the exact steps of; had staid a few hours and then
returned again to Lyme, and without any present intention of quitting
it any more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had enquired after her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found, particularly; had
expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) hope of Miss Elliot's not being the worse for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
exertions, and had spoken of those exertions as great. This was
handsome, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) more pleasure than almost anything else could
have done.

<p/>As to the sad catastrophe itself, it could be canvassed only in one
style by a couple of steady, sensible women, whose judgements had to
work on ascertained events; and it was perfectly decided that it had
been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence; that
its effects were most alarming, and that it was frightful to think, how
long Miss Musgrove's recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)
would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter! The
Admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, a very bad business indeed. A new sort of way this, for a young
fellow to be making love, by breaking his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mistress's head, is not it,
Miss Elliot? This is breaking a head and giving a plaster, truly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Admiral</b></font>)</div><p/>Admiral Croft's manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady
Russell, but they delighted Anne. His (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) goodness of heart and simplicity
of character were irresistible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, this must be very bad for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>), suddenly rousing from a
little reverie, <div class="bookquote">``to be coming and finding us here. I had not
recollected it before, I declare, but it must be very bad. But now, do
not stand upon ceremony. Get up and go over all the rooms in the house
if you like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Another time, Sir, I thank you, not now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, whenever it suits you. You can slip in from the shrubbery at
any time; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by
that door. A good place is not it? But,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-checking himself-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``you
will not think it a good place, for yours were always kept in the
butler's room. Ay, so it always is, I believe. One man's ways may be
as good as another's, but we all like our own best. And so you must
judge for yourself, whether it would be better for you to go about the
house or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne, finding she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) might decline it, did so, very gratefully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have made very few changes either,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Admiral</b></font>)</div>continued the Admiral, after
thinking a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Very few. We told you about the laundry-door, at
Uppercross. That has been a very great improvement. The wonder was,
how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its
opening as it did, so long! You will tell Sir Walter what we have
done, and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house
ever had. Indeed, I must do ourselves the justice to say, that the few
alterations we have made have been all very much for the better. My
wife should have the credit of them, however. I have done very little
besides sending away some of the large looking-glasses from my
dressing-room, which was your father's. A very good man, and very much
the gentleman I am sure: but I should think, Miss Elliot,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-looking
with serious reflection-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``I should think he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) must be rather a dressy
man for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) time of life. Such a number of looking-glasses! oh Lord!
there was no getting away from one's self. So I got Sophy to lend me a
hand, and we soon shifted their quarters; and now I am quite snug, with
my little shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing that I
never go near.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed for an answer,
and the Admiral, fearing he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) might not have been civil enough, took up
the subject again, to say--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot, pray give
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) my compliments and Mrs Croft's, and say that we are settled here
quite to our liking, and have no fault at all to find with the place.
The breakfast-room chimney smokes a little, I grant you, but it is only
when the wind is due north and blows hard, which may not happen three
times a winter. And take it altogether, now that we have been into
most of the houses hereabouts and can judge, there is not one that we
like better than this. Pray say so, with my compliments. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) will be
glad to hear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other: but
the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at
present; for when it was returned, the Crofts announced themselves to
be going away for a few weeks, to visit their connexions in the north
of the county, and probably might not be at home again before Lady
Russell would be removing to Bath.

<p/>So ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch
Hall, or of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) in company with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend. Everything was safe
enough, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) smiled over the many anxious feelings she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had wasted on
the subject.



<p/>Chapter 14


<p/>Though Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after Mr and
Mrs Musgrove's going than Anne conceived they could have been at all
wanted, they were yet the first of the family to be at home again; and
as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over to
the Lodge. They had left Louisa beginning to sit up; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) head,
though clear, was exceedingly weak, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) nerves susceptible to the
highest extreme of tenderness; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) might be pronounced to be
altogether doing very well, it was still impossible to say when she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>)
might be able to bear the removal home; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) father and mother, who
must return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas
holidays, had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) with them.

<p/>They had been all in lodgings together. Mrs Musgrove had got Mrs
Harville's children away as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) could, every possible supply
from Uppercross had been furnished, to lighten the inconvenience to the
Harvilles, while the Harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinner
every day; and in short, it seemed to have been only a struggle on each
side as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable.

<p/>Mary had had her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) evils; but upon the whole, as was evident by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
staying so long, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had found more to enjoy than to suffer. Charles
Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>); and when they dined
with the Harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to wait, and at
first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence; but then,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had received so very handsome an apology from her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) on finding out
whose daughter she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) was, and there had been so much going on every day,
there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had got books from the library, and changed them so often, that
the balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme. She (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had been
taken to Charmouth too, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had bathed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had gone to church,
and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at
Lyme than at Uppercross; and all this, joined to the sense of being so
very useful, had made really an agreeable fortnight.

<p/>Anne enquired after Captain Benwick. Mary's face was clouded directly.
Charles laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Captain Benwick is very well, I believe, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) is a very odd
young man. I do not know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) would be at. We asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) to come
home with us for a day or two: Charles undertook to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) some
shooting, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) seemed quite delighted, and, for my part, I thought it
was all settled; when behold! on Tuesday night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) made a very awkward
sort of excuse; `he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) never shot' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) had `been quite misunderstood,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) had promised this and he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) had promised that, and the end of it
was, I found, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) did not mean to come. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) was afraid of
finding it dull; but upon my word I should have thought we were lively
enough at the Cottage for such a heart-broken man as Captain Benwick.''

<p/>Charles laughed again and said, <div class="bookquote">``Now Mary, you know very well how it
really was. It was all your doing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>-LRB-turning to Anne.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) fancied
that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) went with us, he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) should find you close by: he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) fancied
everybody to be living in Uppercross; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) discovered that Lady
Russell lived three miles off, his (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) heart failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) had not
courage to come. That is the fact, upon my honour. Mary knows it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mary did not give into it very graciously, whether from not
considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in
love with an Elliot, or from not wanting to believe Anne a greater
attraction to Uppercross than herself, must be left to be guessed.
Anne's good-will, however, was not to be lessened by what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heard.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) boldly acknowledged herself flattered, and continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) enquiries.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) talks of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>cried Charles, <div class="bookquote">``in such terms--''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>Mary
interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I declare, Charles, I never heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) mention Anne
twice all the time I was there. I declare, Anne, he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) never talks of you
at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>admitted Charles, ``I do not know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) ever does, in a general
way; but however, it is a very clear thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) admires you
exceedingly. His (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) head is full of some books that he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) is reading upon
your recommendation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) wants to talk to you about them; he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) has
found out something or other in one of them which he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) thinks--oh! I
cannot pretend to remember it, but it was something very fine--I
overheard him (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) telling Henrietta all about it; and then ``Miss Elliot'
was spoken of in the highest terms! Now Mary, I declare it was so, I
heard it myself, and you were in the other room. <div class="bookquote">``Elegance, sweetness,
beauty.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh! there was no end of Miss Elliot's charms.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>cried Mary, warmly, <div class="bookquote">``it was a very little to his (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>)
credit, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) did. Miss Harville only died last June. Such a heart is
very little worth having; is it, Lady Russell? I am sure you will
agree with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must see Captain Benwick before I decide,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Russell</b></font>)</div>said Lady Russell,
smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And that you are very likely to do very soon, I can tell you, ma'am,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>said Charles. <div class="bookquote">``Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had not nerves for coming away with us, and
setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) will make
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) way over to Kellynch one day by himself, you may depend on it. I
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) the distance and the road, and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) of the church's
being so very well worth seeing; for as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) has a taste for those sort
of things, I thought that would be a good excuse, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) listened with
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) understanding and soul; and I am sure from his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) manner that you
will have him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) calling here soon. So, I give you notice, Lady Russell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Any acquaintance of Anne's will always be welcome to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Russell</b></font>)</div>was Lady
Russell's kind answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! as to being Anne's acquaintance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) is rather
my acquaintance, for I have been seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) every day this last
fortnight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, as your joint acquaintance, then, I shall be very happy to see
Captain Benwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not find anything very agreeable in him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), I assure you, ma'am.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) is one of the dullest young men that ever lived. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) has walked with
me, sometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying a
word. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) is not at all a well-bred young man. I am sure you will not
like him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There we differ, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I think Lady Russell would like
him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) would be so much pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) mind, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>)
would very soon see no deficiency in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) manner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>said Charles. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure Lady Russell would like him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) is just Lady Russell's sort. Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) a book, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) will read all
day long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) will!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mary, tauntingly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) will sit poring
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) book, and not know when a person speaks to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), or when one
drops one's scissors, or anything that happens. Do you think Lady
Russell would like that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Russell</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Russell could not help laughing. <div class="bookquote">``Upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I
should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted
of such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact as I may
call myself. I have really a curiosity to see the person who can give
occasion to such directly opposite notions. I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) may be induced
to call here. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) does, Mary, you may depend upon hearing my
opinion; but I am determined not to judge him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) beforehand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), I will answer for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Russell</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Russell began talking of something else. Mary spoke with
animation of their meeting with, or rather missing, Mr Elliot so
extraordinarily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) is a man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Russell</b></font>)</div>said Lady Russell, <div class="bookquote">``whom I have no wish to see. His (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) family, has left
a very strong impression in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) disfavour with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Russell</b></font>)</div><p/>This decision checked Mary's eagerness, and stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) short in the
midst of the Elliot countenance.

<p/>With regard to Captain Wentworth, though Anne hazarded no enquiries,
there was voluntary communication sufficient. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) spirits had been
greatly recovering lately as might be expected. As Louisa improved, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
had improved, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was now quite a different creature from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
had been the first week. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had not seen Louisa; and was so extremely
fearful of any ill consequence to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) from an interview, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) did
not press for it at all; and, on the contrary, seemed to have a plan of
going away for a week or ten days, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) head was stronger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had
talked of going down to Plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade
Captain Benwick to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>); but, as Charles maintained to the last,
Captain Benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch.

<p/>There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionally
thinking of Captain Benwick, from this time. Lady Russell could not
hear the door-bell without feeling that it might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) herald; nor
could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
father's grounds, or any visit of charity in the village, without
wondering whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) might see him (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) or hear of him (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>). Captain Benwick
came not, however. He (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) was either less disposed for it than Charles had
imagined, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) was too shy; and after giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) a week's indulgence,
Lady Russell determined him (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) to be unworthy of the interest which he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) had
been beginning to excite.

<p/>The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from
school, bringing with them Mrs Harville's little children, to improve
the noise of Uppercross, and lessen that of Lyme. Henrietta remained
with Louisa; but all the rest of the family were again in their usual
quarters.

<p/>Lady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once, when Anne
could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again.
Though neither Henrietta, nor Louisa, nor Charles Hayter, nor Captain
Wentworth were there, the room presented as strong a contrast as could
be wished to the last state she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) had seen it in.

<p/>Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles, whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from
the Cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them. On one side was a table
occupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk and gold paper; and
on the other were tressels and trays, bending under the weight of brawn
and cold pies, where riotous boys were holding high revel; the whole
completed by a roaring Christmas fire, which seemed determined to be
heard, in spite of all the noise of the others. Charles and Mary also
came in, of course, during their visit, and Mr Musgrove made a point of
paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) respects to Lady Russell, and sat down close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) for ten
minutes, talking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of the
children on his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) knees, generally in vain. It was a fine family-piece.

<p/>Anne, judging from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own temperament, would have deemed such a
domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves, which Louisa's
illness must have so greatly shaken. But Mrs Musgrove, who got Anne
near her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) on purpose to thank her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) most cordially, again and again, for
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) attentions to them, concluded a short recapitulation of what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had suffered herself by observing, with a happy glance round the
room, that after all she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had gone through, nothing was so likely to do
her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home.

<p/>Louisa was now recovering apace. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) mother could even think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>)
being able to join their party at home, before her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) brothers and sisters
went to school again. The Harvilles had promised to come with her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) and
stay at Uppercross, whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) returned. Captain Wentworth was gone,
for the present, to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) brother in Shropshire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I shall remember, in future,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Russell</b></font>)</div>said Lady Russell, as soon as
they were reseated in the carriage, <div class="bookquote">``not to call at Uppercross in the
Christmas holidays.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Russell</b></font>)</div><p/>Everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters; and
sounds are quite innoxious, or most distressing, by their sort rather
than their quantity. When Lady Russell not long afterwards, was
entering Bath on a wet afternoon, and driving through the long course
of streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place, amidst the dash of
other carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays, the bawling of
newspapermen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless clink of
pattens, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) made no complaint. No, these were noises which belonged
to the winter pleasures; her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) spirits rose under their influence; and
like Mrs Musgrove, she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) was feeling, though not saying, that after being
long in the country, nothing could be so good for her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) as a little quiet
cheerfulness.

<p/>Anne did not share these feelings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) persisted in a very determined,
though very silent disinclination for Bath; caught the first dim view
of the extensive buildings, smoking in rain, without any wish of seeing
them better; felt their progress through the streets to be, however
disagreeable, yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
arrived? And looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles of
Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch.

<p/>Elizabeth's last letter had communicated a piece of news of some
interest. Mr Elliot was in Bath. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had called in Camden Place; had
called a second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive. If
Elizabeth and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father did not deceive themselves, had been taking
much pains to seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the
connection, as he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had formerly taken pains to shew neglect. This was
very wonderful if it were true; and Lady Russell was in a state of very
agreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot, already recanting
the sentiment she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had so lately expressed to Mary, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) being <div class="bookquote">``a man
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had no wish to see.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had a great wish to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) must be
forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree.

<p/>Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would rather see Mr Elliot again than not, which was more
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could say for many other persons in Bath.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was put down in Camden Place; and Lady Russell then drove to her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>)
own lodgings, in Rivers Street.



<p/>Chapter 15


<p/>Sir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place, a lofty
dignified situation, such as becomes a man of consequence; and both he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
and Elizabeth were settled there, much to their satisfaction.

<p/>Anne entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment of
many months, and anxiously saying to herself, <div class="bookquote">``Oh! when shall I leave
you again?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>A degree of unexpected cordiality, however, in the welcome
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) received, did her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) good. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father and sister were glad to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), for the sake of shewing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) the house and furniture, and met her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
with kindness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) making a fourth, when they sat down to dinner, was
noticed as an advantage.

<p/>Mrs Clay was very pleasant, and very smiling, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) courtesies and
smiles were more a matter of course. Anne had always felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
would pretend what was proper on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) arrival, but the complaisance of
the others was unlooked for. They were evidently in excellent spirits,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was soon to listen to the causes. They had no inclination to
listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). After laying out for some compliments of being deeply
regretted in their old neighbourhood, which Anne could not pay, they
had only a few faint enquiries to make, before the talk must be all
their own. Uppercross excited no interest, Kellynch very little: it
was all Bath.

<p/>They had the pleasure of assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) that Bath more than answered
their expectations in every respect. Their house was undoubtedly the
best in Camden Place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages
over all the others which they had either seen or heard of, and the
superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up, or the taste
of the furniture. Their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after.
Everybody was wanting to visit them. They had drawn back from many
introductions, and still were perpetually having cards left by people
of whom they knew nothing.

<p/>Here were funds of enjoyment. Could Anne wonder that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father and
sister were happy? She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) might not wonder, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must sigh that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
father should feel no degradation in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) change, should see nothing to
regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder, should
find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must
sigh, and smile, and wonder too, as Elizabeth threw open the
folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room to the
other, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that woman, who
had been mistress of Kellynch Hall, finding extent to be proud of
between two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder.

<p/>But this was not all which they had to make them happy. They had Mr
Elliot too. Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was not
only pardoned, they were delighted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had been in Bath about
a fortnight; -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had passed through Bath in November, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) way to
London, when the intelligence of Sir Walter's being settled there had
of course reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>), though only twenty-four hours in the place, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had not been able to avail himself of it;-RRB- but he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had now been a
fortnight in Bath, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) first object on arriving, had been to leave
his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) card in Camden Place, following it up by such assiduous endeavours
to meet, and when they did meet, by such great openness of conduct,
such readiness to apologize for the past, such solicitude to be
received as a relation again, that their former good understanding was
completely re-established.

<p/>They had not a fault to find in him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had explained away all the
appearance of neglect on his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) own side. It had originated in
misapprehension entirely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had never had an idea of throwing himself
off; he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had feared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was thrown off, but knew not why, and
delicacy had kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) silent. Upon the hint of having spoken
disrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
was quite indignant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>), who had ever boasted of being an Elliot, and
whose feelings, as to connection, were only too strict to suit the
unfeudal tone of the present day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was astonished, indeed, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
character and general conduct must refute it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) could refer Sir
Walter to all who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>); and certainly, the pains he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had been taking
on this, the first opportunity of reconciliation, to be restored to the
footing of a relation and heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
opinions on the subject.

<p/>The circumstances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) marriage, too, were found to admit of much
extenuation. This was an article not to be entered on by himself; but
a very intimate friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), a Colonel Wallis, a highly respectable
man, perfectly the gentleman, -LRB-and not an ill-looking man, Sir Walter
added-RRB-, who was living in very good style in Marlborough Buildings, and
had, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) own particular request, been admitted to their acquaintance
through Mr Elliot, had mentioned one or two things relative to the
marriage, which made a material difference in the discredit of it.

<p/>Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long, had been well acquainted also
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) wife, had perfectly understood the whole story. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) was
certainly not a woman of family, but well educated, accomplished, rich,
and excessively in love with his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) friend. There had been the charm.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) had sought him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>). Without that attraction, not all her (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) money would
have tempted Elliot, and Sir Walter was, moreover, assured of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
having been a very fine woman. Here was a great deal to soften the
business. A very fine woman with a large fortune, in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)!
Sir Walter seemed to admit it as complete apology; and though Elizabeth
could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
allowed it be a great extenuation.

<p/>Mr Elliot had called repeatedly, had dined with them once, evidently
delighted by the distinction of being asked, for they gave no dinners
in general; delighted, in short, by every proof of cousinly notice, and
placing his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place.

<p/>Anne listened, but without quite understanding it. Allowances, large
allowances, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew, must be made for the ideas of those who spoke.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heard it all under embellishment. All that sounded extravagant or
irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin
but in the language of the relators. Still, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had the
sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared, in
Mr Elliot's wishing, after an interval of so many years, to be well
received by them. In a worldly view, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had nothing to gain by being
on terms with Sir Walter; nothing to risk by a state of variance. In
all probability he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was already the richer of the two, and the Kellynch
estate would as surely be his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) hereafter as the title. A sensible man,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had looked like a very sensible man, why should it be an object
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) could only offer one solution; it was, perhaps, for
Elizabeth's sake. There might really have been a liking formerly,
though convenience and accident had drawn him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) a different way; and now
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) could afford to please himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) might mean to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
addresses to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). Elizabeth was certainly very handsome, with
well-bred, elegant manners, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) character might never have been
penetrated by Mr Elliot, knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) but in public, and when very young
himself. How her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) temper and understanding might bear the investigation
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) present keener time of life was another concern and rather a
fearful one. Most earnestly did she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) might not be too
nice, or too observant if Elizabeth were his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) object; and that Elizabeth
was disposed to believe herself so, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) friend Mrs Clay was
encouraging the idea, seemed apparent by a glance or two between them,
while Mr Elliot's frequent visits were talked of.

<p/>Anne mentioned the glimpses she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had had of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) at Lyme, but without
being much attended to. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes, perhaps, it had been Mr Elliot.
They did not know. It might be him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), perhaps.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>They could not listen
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) description of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>). They were describing him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) themselves; Sir
Walter especially. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) did justice to his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) very gentlemanlike
appearance, his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) air of elegance and fashion, his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) good shaped face, his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
sensible eye; but, at the same time, <div class="bookquote">``must lament his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) being very much
under-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased; nor could he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for
the worse. Mr Elliot appeared to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) -LRB-Sir Walter-RRB- was
looking exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had done when they last parted;''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>but Sir Walter
had <div class="bookquote">``not been able to return the compliment entirely, which had
embarrassed him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) did not mean to complain, however. Mr Elliot was
better to look at than most men, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had no objection to being seen
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) anywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Elliot, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) friends in Marlborough Buildings, were talked of the
whole evening. <div class="bookquote">``Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be introduced
to them! and Mr Elliot so anxious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) should!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wallis/Mrs Wallis</b></font>)</div>and there was a Mrs
Wallis, at present known only to them by description, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) was in
daily expectation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) confinement; but Mr Elliot spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) as <div class="bookquote">``a
most charming woman, quite worthy of being known in Camden Place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Elliot</b></font>)</div>and
as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) recovered they were to be acquainted. Sir Walter
thought much of Mrs Wallis; she (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) was said to be an excessively pretty
woman, beautiful. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) longed to see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might make some
amends for the many very plain faces he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was continually passing in the
streets. The worst of Bath was the number of its plain women. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) did
not mean to say that there were no pretty women, but the number of the
plain was out of all proportion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had frequently observed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
walked, that one handsome face would be followed by thirty, or
five-and-thirty frights; and once, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had stood in a shop on Bond
Street, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) had counted eighty-seven women go by, one after another,
without there being a tolerable face among them. It had been a frosty
morning, to be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly one woman in a
thousand could stand the test of. But still, there certainly were a
dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men! they
were infinitely worse. Such scarecrows as the streets were full of!
It was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything
tolerable, by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with Colonel Wallis -LRB-who was a
fine military figure, though sandy-haired-RRB- without observing that every
woman's eye was upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>); every woman's eye was sure to be upon Colonel
Wallis.''  (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div>Modest Sir Walter! He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was not allowed to escape, however.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting that Colonel Wallis's
companion might have as good a figure as Colonel Wallis, and certainly
was not sandy-haired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is Mary looking?''  (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Sir Walter, in the height of his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) good
humour. <div class="bookquote">``The last time I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had a red nose, but I hope that
may not happen every day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no, that must have been quite accidental. In general she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) has been
in very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I thought it would not tempt her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to go out in sharp winds, and grow
coarse, I would send her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a new hat and pelisse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne was considering whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) should venture to suggest that a gown,
or a cap, would not be liable to any such misuse, when a knock at the
door suspended everything. <div class="bookquote">``A knock at the door! and so late! It was
ten o'clock. Could it be Mr Elliot? They knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was to dine in
Lansdown Crescent. It was possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) might stop in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) way home
to ask them how they did. They could think of no one else. Mrs Clay
decidedly thought it Mr Elliot's knock.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Clay</b></font>)</div>Mrs Clay was right. With all
the state which a butler and foot-boy could give, Mr Elliot was ushered
into the room.

<p/>It was the same, the very same man, with no difference but of dress.
Anne drew a little back, while the others received his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) compliments, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sister his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) apologies for calling at so unusual an hour, but <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>)
friend had taken cold the day before,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister apologies</b></font>)</div>&c. &c; which was all as
politely done, and as politely taken, as possible, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) part must
follow then. Sir Walter talked of his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) youngest daughter; <div class="bookquote">``Mr Elliot
must give him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) leave to present him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) youngest daughter''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>-LRB-there was
no occasion for remembering Mary-RRB-; and Anne, smiling and blushing, very
becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features which he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had by no
means forgotten, and instantly saw, with amusement at his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) little start
of surprise, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had not been at all aware of who she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
looked completely astonished, but not more astonished than pleased; his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
eyes brightened! and with the most perfect alacrity he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) welcomed the
relationship, alluded to the past, and entreated to be received as an
acquaintance already. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was quite as good-looking as he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had appeared
at Lyme, his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) countenance improved by speaking, and his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) manners were so
exactly what they ought to be, so polished, so easy, so particularly
agreeable, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could compare them in excellence to only one
person's manners. They were not the same, but they were, perhaps,
equally good.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) sat down with them, and improved their conversation very much.
There could be no doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) being a sensible man. Ten minutes were
enough to certify that. His (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) tone, his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) expressions, his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) choice of
subject, his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) knowing where to stop; it was all the operation of a
sensible, discerning mind. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) could, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) began to talk to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) of Lyme, wanting to compare opinions respecting the place, but
especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to
be guests in the same inn at the same time; to give his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) own route,
understand something of hers, and regret that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) should have lost such
an opportunity of paying his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) respects to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) a short
account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) party and business at Lyme. His (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) regret increased as he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
listened. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had spent his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) whole solitary evening in the room
adjoining theirs; had heard voices, mirth continually; thought they
must be a most delightful set of people, longed to be with them, but
certainly without the smallest suspicion of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) possessing the shadow
of a right to introduce himself. If he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had but asked who the party
were! The name of Musgrove would have told him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) enough. ``Well, it
would serve to cure him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) of an absurd practice of never asking a
question at an inn, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had adopted, when quite a young man, on
the principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``as to
what is necessary in manners to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quite the thing, are more
absurd, I believe, than those of any other set of beings in the world.
The folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the
folly of what they have in view.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) must not be addressing his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) reflections to Anne alone: he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) knew
it; he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was soon diffused again among the others, and it was only at
intervals that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) could return to Lyme.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) enquiries, however, produced at length an account of the scene she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
had been engaged in there, soon after his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) leaving the place. Having
alluded to <div class="bookquote">``an accident,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) must hear the whole. When he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) questioned,
Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also, but the difference in
their manner of doing it could not be unfelt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could only compare
Mr Elliot to Lady Russell, in the wish of really comprehending what had
passed, and in the degree of concern for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) must have suffered in
witnessing it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) staid an hour with them. The elegant little clock on the mantel-piece
had struck <div class="bookquote">``eleven with its silver sounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>the watchman</b></font>)</div>and the watchman was
beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale, before Mr
Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had been there long.

<p/>Anne could not have supposed it possible that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) first evening in
Camden Place could have passed so well!



<p/>Chapter 16


<p/>There was one point which Anne, on returning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) family, would have
been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot's being in love
with Elizabeth, which was, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father's not being in love with Mrs
Clay; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) was very far from easy about it, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) had been at
home a few hours. On going down to breakfast the next morning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>)
found there had just been a decent pretence on the lady's side of
meaning to leave them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) could imagine Mrs Clay to have said, that
<div class="bookquote">``now Miss Anne was come, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not suppose herself at all wanted;''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Clay</b></font>)</div>for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper, <div class="bookquote">``That must not be any
reason, indeed. I assure you I feel it none. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) is nothing to me,
compared with you;''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was in full time to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father say,
<div class="bookquote">``My dear madam, this must not be. As yet, you have seen nothing of
Bath. You have been here only to be useful. You must not run away
from us now. You must stay to be acquainted with Mrs Wallis, the
beautiful Mrs Wallis. To your fine mind, I well know the sight of
beauty is a real gratification.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spoke and looked so much in earnest, that Anne was not surprised to
see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
countenance, perhaps, might express some watchfulness; but the praise
of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister. The
lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties, and promise to stay.

<p/>In the course of the same morning, Anne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father chancing to be
alone together, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) began to compliment her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) improved looks; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``less thin in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) person, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) cheeks; her (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) skin, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>)
complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) been using any
thing in particular?''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, nothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Merely Gowland,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) supposed.
<div class="bookquote">``No, nothing at all.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ha! he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) was surprised at that;''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and added,
<div class="bookquote">``certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are; you cannot
be better than well; or I should recommend Gowland, the constant use of
Gowland, during the spring months. Mrs Clay has been using it at my
recommendation, and you see what it has done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>). You see how it
has carried away her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) freckles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>If Elizabeth could but have heard this! Such personal praise might
have struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), especially as it did not appear to Anne that the
freckles were at all lessened. But everything must take its chance.
The evil of a marriage would be much diminished, if Elizabeth were also
to marry. As for herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might always command a home with Lady
Russell.

<p/>Lady Russell's composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial
on this point, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) intercourse in Camden Place. The sight of Mrs
Clay in such favour, and of Anne so overlooked, was a perpetual
provocation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) there; and vexed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) as much when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was away, as a
person in Bath who drinks the water, gets all the new publications, and
has a very large acquaintance, has time to be vexed.

<p/>As Mr Elliot became known to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) grew more charitable, or more
indifferent, towards the others. His (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) manners were an immediate
recommendation; and on conversing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found the solid so fully
supporting the superficial, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was at first, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) told Anne,
almost ready to exclaim, <div class="bookquote">``Can this be Mr Elliot?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>and could not
seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man.
Everything united in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); good understanding, correct opinions,
knowledge of the world, and a warm heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had strong feelings of
family attachment and family honour, without pride or weakness; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
lived with the liberality of a man of fortune, without display; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
judged for himself in everything essential, without defying public
opinion in any point of worldly decorum. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was steady, observant,
moderate, candid; never run away with by spirits or by selfishness,
which fancied itself strong feeling; and yet, with a sensibility to
what was amiable and lovely, and a value for all the felicities of
domestic life, which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent
agitation seldom really possess. She (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) was sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not been
happy in marriage. Colonel Wallis said it, and Lady Russell saw it;
but it had been no unhappiness to sour his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) mind, nor -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) began pretty
soon to suspect-RRB- to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) thinking of a second choice. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>)
satisfaction in Mr Elliot outweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay.

<p/>It was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
excellent friend could sometimes think differently; and it did not
surprise her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), therefore, that Lady Russell should see nothing
suspicious or inconsistent, nothing to require more motives than
appeared, in Mr Elliot's great desire of a reconciliation. In Lady
Russell's view, it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot, at a mature
time of life, should feel it a most desirable object, and what would
very generally recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) among all sensible people, to be on good
terms with the head of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) family; the simplest process in the world of
time upon a head naturally clear, and only erring in the heyday of
youth. Anne presumed, however, still to smile about it, and at last to
mention <div class="bookquote">``Elizabeth.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>Lady Russell listened, and looked, and made only
this cautious reply:--<div class="bookquote">``Elizabeth! very well; time will explain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Russell</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a reference to the future, which Anne, after a little
observation, felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must submit to. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could determine nothing at
present. In that house Elizabeth must be first; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was in the
habit of such general observance as <div class="bookquote">``Miss Elliot,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>that any
particularity of attention seemed almost impossible. Mr Elliot, too,
it must be remembered, had not been a widower seven months. A little
delay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) side might be very excusable. In fact, Anne could never
see the crape round his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) hat, without fearing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was the
inexcusable one, in attributing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) such imaginations; for though
his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed so many
years that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the
awful impression of its being dissolved.

<p/>However it might end, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was without any question their pleasantest
acquaintance in Bath: she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw nobody equal to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>); and it was a great
indulgence now and then to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) about Lyme, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) seemed to
have as lively a wish to see again, and to see more of, as herself.
They went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many
times. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) with some
earnestness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew it well; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) remembered another person's
look also.

<p/>They did not always think alike. His (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) value for rank and connexion she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
perceived was greater than hers. It was not merely complaisance, it
must be a liking to the cause, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) enter warmly into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
father and sister's solicitudes on a subject which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thought unworthy
to excite them. The Bath paper one morning announced the arrival of
the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) daughter, the Honourable
Miss Carteret; and all the comfort of No. --, Camden Place, was swept
away for many days; for the Dalrymples -LRB-in Anne's opinion, most
unfortunately-RRB- were cousins of the Elliots; and the agony was how to
introduce themselves properly.

<p/>Anne had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father and sister before in contact with
nobility, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must acknowledge herself disappointed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had hoped
better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life, and
was reduced to form a wish which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had never foreseen; a wish that
they had more pride; for <div class="bookquote">``our cousins Lady Dalrymple and Miss
Carteret;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``our cousins, the Dalrymples,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>sounded in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ears all day
long.

<p/>Sir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount, but had
never seen any of the rest of the family; and the difficulties of the
case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by
letters of ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount,
when, in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter's at the same
time, there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch. No letter of
condolence had been sent to Ireland. The neglect had been visited on
the head of the sinner; for when poor Lady Elliot died herself, no
letter of condolence was received at Kellynch, and, consequently, there
was but too much reason to apprehend that the Dalrymples considered the
relationship as closed. How to have this anxious business set to
rights, and be admitted as cousins again, was the question: and it was
a question which, in a more rational manner, neither Lady Russell nor
Mr Elliot thought unimportant. <div class="bookquote">``Family connexions were always worth
preserving, good company always worth seeking; Lady Dalrymple had taken
a house, for three months, in Laura Place, and would be living in
style. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had been at Bath the year before, and Lady Russell had
heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) spoken of as a charming woman. It was very desirable that
the connexion should be renewed, if it could be done, without any
compromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Walter, however, would choose his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) own means, and at last wrote a
very fine letter of ample explanation, regret, and entreaty, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
right honourable cousin. Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot could
admire the letter; but it did all that was wanted, in bringing three
lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was very much
honoured, and should be happy in their acquaintance.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The toils of the
business were over, the sweets began. They visited in Laura Place,
they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple, and the Honourable
Miss Carteret, to be arranged wherever they might be most visible: and
<div class="bookquote">``Our cousins in Laura Place,'' (<font color='red'><b>Viscountess Dalrymple</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Our cousin, Lady Dalrymple and Miss
Carteret,''  (<font color='red'><b>Viscountess Dalrymple</b></font>)</div>were talked of to everybody.

<p/>Anne was ashamed. Had Lady Dalrymple and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) daughter even been very
agreeable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) would still have been ashamed of the agitation they
created, but they were nothing. There was no superiority of manner,
accomplishment, or understanding. Lady Dalrymple had acquired the name
of <div class="bookquote">``a charming woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Dalrymple</b></font>)</div>because she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) had a smile and a civil answer for
everybody. Miss Carteret, with still less to say, was so plain and so
awkward, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) would never have been tolerated in Camden Place but
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) birth.

<p/>Lady Russell confessed she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had expected something better; but yet <div class="bookquote">``it
was an acquaintance worth having;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and when Anne ventured to speak her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
opinion of them to Mr Elliot, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) agreed to their being nothing in
themselves, but still maintained that, as a family connexion, as good
company, as those who would collect good company around them, they had
their value. Anne smiled and said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever,
well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation; that is
what I call good company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are mistaken,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) gently, <div class="bookquote">``that is not good company; that is
the best. Good company requires only birth, education, and manners,
and with regard to education is not very nice. Birth and good manners
are essential; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing
in good company; on the contrary, it will do very well. My cousin Anne
shakes her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) is not satisfied. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) is fastidious. My dear
cousin''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-sitting down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``you have a better right to be
fastidious than almost any other woman I know; but will it answer?
Will it make you happy? Will it not be wiser to accept the society of

move in the first set in Bath this winter, and as rank is rank, your
being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your
family -LRB-our family let me say-RRB- in that degree of consideration which we
must all wish for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>sighed Anne, <div class="bookquote">``we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>then recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) added,
<div class="bookquote">``I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to
procure the acquaintance. I suppose''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-smiling-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``I have more pride than
any of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we should be so
solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may be very

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me, dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims. In London,
perhaps, in your present quiet style of living, it might be as you say:

knowing: always acceptable as acquaintance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Anne, <div class="bookquote">``I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome
which depends so entirely upon place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I love your indignation,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``it is very natural. But here you
are in Bath, and the object is to be established here with all the
credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot. You
talk of being proud; I am called proud, I know, and I shall not wish to
believe myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated, would have
the same object, I have no doubt, though the kind may seem a little
different. In one point, I am sure, my dear cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) continued,
speaking lower, though there was no one else in the room-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``in one
point, I am sure, we must feel alike. We must feel that every addition

in diverting his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thoughts from those who are beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) looked, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) spoke, to the seat which Mrs Clay had been lately
occupying: a sufficient explanation of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) particularly meant; and
though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was pleased with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) for not liking Mrs Clay; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) conscience
admitted that his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) wishing to promote her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) father's getting great
acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>).



<p/>Chapter 17


<p/>While Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their good
fortune in Laura Place, Anne was renewing an acquaintance of a very
different description.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had called on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) former governess, and had heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) of there
being an old school-fellow in Bath, who had the two strong claims on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) attention of past kindness and present suffering. Miss Hamilton,
now Mrs Smith, had shewn her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) kindness in one of those periods of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
life when it had been most valuable. Anne had gone unhappy to school,
grieving for the loss of a mother whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had dearly loved, feeling
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen, of
strong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time;
and Miss Hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from the
want of near relations and a settled home, remaining another year at
school, had been useful and good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamilton</b></font>) in a way which had considerably
lessened her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamilton</b></font>) misery, and could never be remembered with indifference.

<p/>Miss Hamilton had left school, had married not long afterwards, was
said to have married a man of fortune, and this was all that Anne had
known of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), till now that their governess's account brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
situation forward in a more decided but very different form.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was a widow and poor. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) husband had been extravagant; and at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
death, about two years before, had left his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) affairs dreadfully
involved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had had difficulties of every sort to contend with, and
in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe
rheumatic fever, which, finally settling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) legs, had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) for
the present a cripple. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had come to Bath on that account, and was
now in lodgings near the hot baths, living in a very humble way, unable
even to afford herself the comfort of a servant, and of course almost
excluded from society.

<p/>Their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from
Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith, and Anne therefore lost no time in
going. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mentioned nothing of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had heard, or what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
intended, at home. It would excite no proper interest there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) only
consulted Lady Russell, who entered thoroughly into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sentiments, and
was most happy to convey her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) as near to Mrs Smith's lodgings in
Westgate Buildings, as Anne chose to be taken.

<p/>The visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest
in each other more than re-kindled. The first ten minutes had its
awkwardness and its emotion. Twelve years were gone since they had
parted, and each presented a somewhat different person from what the
other had imagined. Twelve years had changed Anne from the blooming,
silent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant little woman of
seven-and-twenty, with every beauty except bloom, and with manners as
consciously right as they were invariably gentle; and twelve years had
transformed the fine-looking, well-grown Miss Hamilton, in all the glow
of health and confidence of superiority, into a poor, infirm, helpless
widow, receiving the visit of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) former protegee as a favour; but all
that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away, and left
only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and
talking over old times.

<p/>Anne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
had almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse and be
cheerful beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) expectation. Neither the dissipations of the
past--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictions of
the present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
heart or ruined her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) spirits.

<p/>In the course of a second visit she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) talked with great openness, and
Anne's astonishment increased. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could scarcely imagine a more
cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had been very fond
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) husband: she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had buried him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had been used to affluence:
it was gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had no child to connect her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) with life and happiness
again, no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs,
no health to make all the rest supportable. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) accommodations were
limited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom behind, with no
possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance, which
there was only one servant in the house to afford, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) never
quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath. Yet, in spite
of all this, Anne had reason to believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had moments only of
languor and depression, to hours of occupation and enjoyment. How
could it be? She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) watched, observed, reflected, and finally determined
that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only. A
submissive spirit might be patient, a strong understanding would supply
resolution, but here was something more; here was that elasticity of
mind, that disposition to be comforted, that power of turning readily
from evil to good, and of finding employment which carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) out of
herself, which was from nature alone. It was the choicest gift of
Heaven; and Anne viewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend as one of those instances in which,
by a merciful appointment, it seems designed to counterbalance almost
every other want.

<p/>There had been a time, Mrs Smith told her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), when her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) spirits had nearly
failed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could not call herself an invalid now, compared with her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
state on first reaching Bath. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had, indeed, been a pitiable
object; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had caught cold on the journey, and had hardly taken
possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) lodgings before she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was again confined to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) bed and
suffering under severe and constant pain; and all this among strangers,
with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse, and finances at
that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
had weathered it, however, and could truly say that it had done her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
good. It had increased her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) comforts by making her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) feel herself to be
in good hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or
disinterested attachment anywhere, but her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) illness had proved to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
that her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) landlady had a character to preserve, and would not use her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
ill; and she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had been particularly fortunate in her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) nurse, as a sister
of her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) landlady, a nurse by profession, and who had always a home in
that house when unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to
attend her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Smith, <div class="bookquote">``besides nursing me most
admirably, has really proved an invaluable acquaintance. As soon as I
could use my hands she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) taught me to knit, which has been a great
amusement; and she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) put me in the way of making these little
thread-cases, pin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so
busy about, and which supply me with the means of doing a little good
to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood. She (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had a
large acquaintance, of course professionally, among those who can
afford to buy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) disposes of my merchandise. She (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always takes
the right time for applying. Everybody's heart is open, you know, when
they have recently escaped from severe pain, or are recovering the
blessing of health, and Nurse Rooke thoroughly understands when to
speak. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rooke</b></font>) is a shrewd, intelligent, sensible woman. Hers is a line
for seeing human nature; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rooke</b></font>) has a fund of good sense and
observation, which, as a companion, make her (<font color='blue'><b>Rooke</b></font>) infinitely superior to
thousands of those who having only received `the best education in the
world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>know nothing worth attending to. Call it gossip, if you will,
but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour's leisure to bestow on me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rooke</b></font>) is
sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable:
something that makes one know one's species better. One likes to hear
what is going on, to be au fait as to the newest modes of being
trifling and silly. To me, who live so much alone, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rooke</b></font>) conversation, I
assure you, is a treat.''

<p/>Anne, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied, <div class="bookquote">``I can easily
believe it. Women of that class have great opportunities, and if they
are intelligent may be well worth listening to. Such varieties of
human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing! And it is not
merely in its follies, that they are well read; for they see it
occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or
affecting. What instances must pass before them of ardent,
disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude,
patience, resignation: of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices
that ennoble us most. A sick chamber may often furnish the worth of
volumes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Smith more doubtingly, <div class="bookquote">``sometimes it may, though I fear
its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe. Here and
there, human nature may be great in times of trial; but generally
speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a
sick chamber: it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity
and fortitude, that one hears of. There is so little real friendship
in the world! and unfortunately''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>-LRB-speaking low and tremulously-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``there
are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne saw the misery of such feelings. The husband had not been what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
ought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) think worse of the world than she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hoped it deserved. It was but a
passing emotion however with Mrs Smith; she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) shook it off, and soon
added in a different tone--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present,
will furnish much either to interest or edify me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rooke</b></font>) is only nursing
Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive,
fashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to report
but of lace and finery. I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis,
however. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) has plenty of money, and I intend she (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) shall buy all the
high-priced things I have in hand now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne had called several times on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend, before the existence of
such a person was known in Camden Place. At last, it became necessary
to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs Clay, returned one
morning from Laura Place, with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple
for the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend that
evening in Westgate Buildings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was not sorry for the excuse. They
were only asked, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was sure, because Lady Dalrymple being kept at
home by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship which had
been so pressed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) declined on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) own account with great
alacrity--<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) was engaged to spend the evening with an old
schoolfellow.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>They were not much interested in anything relative to
Anne; but still there were questions enough asked, to make it
understood what this old schoolfellow was; and Elizabeth was
disdainful, and Sir Walter severe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Westgate Buildings!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and who is Miss Anne Elliot to be
visiting in Westgate Buildings? A Mrs Smith. A widow Mrs Smith; and
who was her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) husband? One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names are to
be met with everywhere. And what is her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) attraction? That she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is old
and sickly. Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot, you have the most
extraordinary taste! Everything that revolts other people, low
company, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations are inviting
to you. But surely you may put off this old lady till to-morrow: she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
is not so near her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) end, I presume, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) may hope to see another
day. What is her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) age? Forty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is not one-and-thirty; but I do not think I can put off
my engagement, because it is the only evening for some time which will
at once suit her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and myself. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) goes into the warm bath to-morrow,
and for the rest of the week, you know, we are engaged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>asked
Elizabeth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) sees nothing to blame in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>replied Anne; <div class="bookquote">``on the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>)
approves it, and has generally taken me when I have called on Mrs
Smith.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance
of a carriage drawn up near its pavement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div>observed Sir Walter. <div class="bookquote">``Sir
Henry Russell's widow, indeed, has no honours to distinguish her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) arms,
but still it is a handsome equipage, and no doubt is well known to
convey a Miss Elliot. A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings!
A poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty; a mere Mrs
Smith, an every-day Mrs Smith, of all people and all names in the
world, to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot, and to be preferred
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) own family connections among the nobility of England and
Ireland! Mrs Smith! Such a name!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Clay</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs Clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it
advisable to leave the room, and Anne could have said much, and did
long to say a little in defence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend's not very dissimilar
claims to theirs, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sense of personal respect to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father
prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) made no reply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) left it to himself to
recollect, that Mrs Smith was not the only widow in Bath between thirty
and forty, with little to live on, and no surname of dignity.

<p/>Anne kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had
been the only one of the set absent, for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had
not only been quite at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) ladyship's service themselves, but had
actually been happy to be employed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) in collecting others, and had
been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot; and Mr
Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early, and Lady
Russell had fresh arranged all her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) evening engagements in order to wait
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>). Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could
supply from Lady Russell. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>), its greatest interest must be, in
having been very much talked of between her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) friend and Mr Elliot; in
having been wished for, regretted, and at the same time honoured for
staying away in such a cause. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) kind, compassionate visits to this
old schoolfellow, sick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted Mr
Elliot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) a most extraordinary young woman; in her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>)
temper, manners, mind, a model of female excellence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) could meet
even Lady Russell in a discussion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) merits; and Anne could not be
given to understand so much by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend, could not know herself to be
so highly rated by a sensible man, without many of those agreeable
sensations which her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend meant to create.

<p/>Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) opinion of Mr Elliot.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was as much convinced of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) meaning to gain Anne in time as of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
deserving her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which
would free him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) from all the remaining restraints of widowhood, and
leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) at liberty to exert his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) most open powers of pleasing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt on the
subject, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would venture on little more than hints of what might be
hereafter, of a possible attachment on his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) side, of the desirableness
of the alliance, supposing such attachment to be real and returned.
Anne heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and made no violent exclamations; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) only smiled,
blushed, and gently shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am no match-maker, as you well know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Russell</b></font>)</div>said Lady Russell, <div class="bookquote">``being much
too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations.
I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) addresses
to you, and if you should be disposed to accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), I think there
would be every possibility of your being happy together. A most
suitable connection everybody must consider it, but I think it might be
a very happy one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Russell</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects I
think highly of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Anne; <div class="bookquote">``but we should not suit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Russell let this pass, and only said in rejoinder, <div class="bookquote">``I own that to
be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch, the future
Lady Elliot, to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother's
place, succeeding to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) rights, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) popularity, as well as
to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) virtues, would be the highest possible gratification to me.
You are your mother's self in countenance and disposition; and if I
might be allowed to fancy you such as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was, in situation and name,
and home, presiding and blessing in the same spot, and only superior to
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in being more highly valued! My dearest Anne, it would give me
more delight than is often felt at my time of life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Russell</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table,
and, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings
this picture excited. For a few moments her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) imagination and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heart
were bewitched. The idea of becoming what her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother had been; of
having the precious name of <div class="bookquote">``Lady Elliot''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>first revived in herself; of
being restored to Kellynch, calling it her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) home again, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) home for
ever, was a charm which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not immediately resist. Lady Russell
said not another word, willing to leave the matter to its own
operation; and believing that, could Mr Elliot at that moment with
propriety have spoken for himself!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) believed, in short, what Anne
did not believe. The same image of Mr Elliot speaking for himself
brought Anne to composure again. The charm of Kellynch and of <div class="bookquote">``Lady
Elliot''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>all faded away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) never could accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>). And it was not
only that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) feelings were still adverse to any man save one; her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
judgement, on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a
case was against Mr Elliot.

<p/>Though they had now been acquainted a month, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not be satisfied
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) really knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) character. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was a sensible man, an
agreeable man, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) talked well, professed good opinions, seemed to
judge properly and as a man of principle, this was all clear enough.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) certainly knew what was right, nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) fix on any one article
of moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would have been
afraid to answer for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conduct. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) distrusted the past, if not the
present. The names which occasionally dropt of former associates, the
allusions to former practices and pursuits, suggested suspicions not
favourable of what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw that there had been bad
habits; that Sunday travelling had been a common thing; that there had
been a period of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life -LRB-and probably not a short one-RRB- when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
been, at least, careless in all serious matters; and, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might
now think very differently, who could answer for the true sentiments of
a clever, cautious man, grown old enough to appreciate a fair
character? How could it ever be ascertained that his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) mind was truly
cleansed?

<p/>Mr Elliot was rational, discreet, polished, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was not open. There
was never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight,
at the evil or good of others. This, to Anne, was a decided
imperfection. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) early impressions were incurable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) prized the
frank, the open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others. Warmth
and enthusiasm did captivate her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) still. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could so
much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or
said a careless or a hasty thing, than of those whose presence of mind
never varied, whose tongue never slipped.

<p/>Mr Elliot was too generally agreeable. Various as were the tempers in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father's house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) pleased them all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) endured too well, stood
too well with every body. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) with some degree of
openness of Mrs Clay; had appeared completely to see what Mrs Clay was
about, and to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) in contempt; and yet Mrs Clay found him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) as
agreeable as any body.

<p/>Lady Russell saw either less or more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) young friend, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) saw
nothing to excite distrust. She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) could not imagine a man more exactly
what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to be than Mr Elliot; nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) ever enjoy a sweeter
feeling than the hope of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) receive the hand of her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) beloved
Anne in Kellynch church, in the course of the following autumn.



<p/>Chapter 18


<p/>It was the beginning of February; and Anne, having been a month in
Bath, was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated. It was three
weeks since she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had heard at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) only knew that Henrietta was at
home again; and that Louisa, though considered to be recovering fast,
was still in Lyme; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) was thinking of them all very intently one
evening, when a thicker letter than usual from Mary was delivered to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>); and, to quicken the pleasure and surprise, with Admiral and Mrs
Croft's compliments.

<p/>The Crofts must be in Bath! A circumstance to interest her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>). They were
people whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) heart turned to very naturally.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div>cried Sir Walter. <div class="bookquote">``The Crofts have arrived in Bath?
The Crofts who rent Kellynch? What have they brought you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A letter from Uppercross Cottage, Sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! those letters are convenient passports. They secure an
introduction. I should have visited Admiral Croft, however, at any
rate. I know what is due to my tenant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne could listen no longer; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not even have told how the poor
Admiral's complexion escaped; her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) letter engrossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). It had been
begun several days back.


<p/>``February 1st.

<p/>``My dear Anne,--I make no apology for my silence, because I know how
little people think of letters in such a place as Bath. You must be a
great deal too happy to care for Uppercross, which, as you well know,
affords little to write about. We have had a very dull Christmas; Mr
and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays. I do
not reckon the Hayters as anybody. The holidays, however, are over at
last: I believe no children ever had such long ones. I am sure I had
not. The house was cleared yesterday, except of the little Harvilles;
but you will be surprised to hear they have never gone home. Mrs
Harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long. I do not
understand it. They are not at all nice children, in my opinion; but
Mrs Musgrove seems to like them quite as well, if not better, than her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)
grandchildren. What dreadful weather we have had! It may not be felt
in Bath, with your nice pavements; but in the country it is of some
consequence. I have not had a creature call on me since the second
week in January, except Charles Hayter, who had been calling much
oftener than was welcome. Between ourselves, I think it a great pity
Henrietta did not remain at Lyme as long as Louisa; it would have kept
her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) a little out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) way. The carriage is gone to-day, to bring
Louisa and the Harvilles to-morrow. We are not asked to dine with
them, however, till the day after, Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)
being fatigued by the journey, which is not very likely, considering
the care that will be taken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>); and it would be much more
convenient to me to dine there to-morrow. I am glad you find Mr Elliot
so agreeable, and wish I could be acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) too; but I have
my usual luck: I am always out of the way when any thing desirable is
going on; always the last of my family to be noticed. What an immense
time Mrs Clay has been staying with Elizabeth! Does she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) never mean to
go away? But perhaps if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) were to leave the room vacant, we might
not be invited. Let me know what you think of this. I do not expect
my children to be asked, you know. I can leave them at the Great House
very well, for a month or six weeks. I have this moment heard that the
Crofts are going to Bath almost immediately; they think the Admiral
gouty. Charles heard it quite by chance; they have not had the
civility to give me any notice, or of offering to take anything. I do
not think they improve at all as neighbours. We see nothing of them,
and this is really an instance of gross inattention. Charles joins me
in love, and everything proper. Yours affectionately,

<p/>``Mary M--.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to say that I am very far from well; and Jemima has just
told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat very much
about. I dare say I shall catch it; and my sore-throats, you know, are
always worse than anybody's.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So ended the first part, which had been afterwards put into an
envelope, containing nearly as much more.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I kept my letter open, that I might send you word how Louisa bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>)
journey, and now I am extremely glad I did, having a great deal to add.
In the first place, I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday, offering to
convey anything to you; a very kind, friendly note indeed, addressed to
me, just as it ought; I shall therefore be able to make my letter as
long as I like. The Admiral does not seem very ill, and I sincerely
hope Bath will do him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) all the good he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) wants. I shall be truly glad to
have them back again. Our neighbourhood cannot spare such a pleasant
family. But now for Louisa. I have something to communicate that will
astonish you not a little. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very
safely, and in the evening we went to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) did, when we were
rather surprised not to find Captain Benwick of the party, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had
been invited as well as the Harvilles; and what do you think was the
reason? Neither more nor less than his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) being in love with Louisa, and
not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had had an answer from Mr
Musgrove; for it was all settled between him (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) came
away, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) father by Captain Harville. True, upon
my honour! Are not you astonished? I shall be surprised at least if
you ever received a hint of it, for I never did. Mrs Musgrove protests
solemnly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) knew nothing of the matter. We are all very well
pleased, however, for though it is not equal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) marrying Captain
Wentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter; and Mr Musgrove
has written his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) consent, and Captain Benwick is expected to-day. Mrs
Harville says her (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) husband feels a good deal on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) poor sister's
account; but, however, Louisa is a great favourite with both. Indeed,
Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) the better for having
nursed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>). Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say; but if
you remember, I never thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) attached to Louisa; I never could see
anything of it. And this is the end, you see, of Captain Benwick's
being supposed to be an admirer of yours. How Charles could take such
a thing into his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) head was always incomprehensible to me. I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
will be more agreeable now. Certainly not a great match for Louisa
Musgrove, but a million times better than marrying among the Hayters.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary need not have feared her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sister's being in any degree prepared for
the news. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) life been more astonished. Captain
Benwick and Louisa Musgrove! It was almost too wonderful for belief,
and it was with the greatest effort that she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) could remain in the room,
preserve an air of calmness, and answer the common questions of the
moment. Happily for her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>), they were not many. Sir Walter wanted to
know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses, and whether they
were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit Miss
Elliot and himself to visit in; but had little curiosity beyond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is Mary?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth; and without waiting for an answer, <div class="bookquote">``And
pray what brings the Crofts to Bath?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They come on the Admiral's account. He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) is thought to be gouty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gout and decrepitude!''  (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Sir Walter. <div class="bookquote">``Poor old gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have they any acquaintance here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>asked Elizabeth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know; but I can hardly suppose that, at Admiral Croft's time
of life, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) profession, he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) should not have many acquaintance in
such a place as this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suspect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Sir Walter coolly, <div class="bookquote">``that Admiral Croft will be best
known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall. Elizabeth, may we
venture to present him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) wife in Laura Place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no! I think not. Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple, cousins,
we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) with acquaintance she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>)
might not approve. If we were not related, it would not signify; but
as cousins, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours. We
had better leave the Crofts to find their own level. There are several
odd-looking men walking about here, who, I am told, are sailors. The
Crofts will associate with them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth's share of interest in the letter;
when Mrs Clay had paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) tribute of more decent attention, in an
enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) fine little boys, Anne was
at liberty.

<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) own room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) tried to comprehend it. Well might Charles wonder
how Captain Wentworth would feel! Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had quitted the field,
had given Louisa up, had ceased to love, had found he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) did not love her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) could not endure the idea of treachery or levity, or anything akin
to ill usage between him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) friend. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) could not endure that
such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly.

<p/>Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove! The high-spirited, joyous-talking
Louisa Musgrove, and the dejected, thinking, feeling, reading, Captain
Benwick, seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other.
Their minds most dissimilar! Where could have been the attraction?
The answer soon presented itself. It had been in situation. They had
been thrown together several weeks; they had been living in the same
small family party: since Henrietta's coming away, they must have been
depending almost entirely on each other, and Louisa, just recovering
from illness, had been in an interesting state, and Captain Benwick was
not inconsolable. That was a point which Anne had not been able to
avoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as
Mary, from the present course of events, they served only to confirm
the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not mean, however, to derive much more from it to gratify her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
vanity, than Mary might have allowed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was persuaded that any
tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) would have received the same compliment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) had an affectionate
heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) must love somebody.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw no reason against their being happy. Louisa had fine naval
fervour to begin with, and they would soon grow more alike. He (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) would
gain cheerfulness, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) would learn to be an enthusiast for Scott
and Lord Byron; nay, that was probably learnt already; of course they
had fallen in love over poetry. The idea of Louisa Musgrove turned
into a person of literary taste, and sentimental reflection was
amusing, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had no doubt of its being so. The day at Lyme, the
fall from the Cobb, might influence her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) health, her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) nerves, her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)
courage, her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) character to the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) life, as thoroughly as it
appeared to have influenced her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) fate.

<p/>The conclusion of the whole was, that if the woman who had been
sensible of Captain Wentworth's merits could be allowed to prefer
another man, there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting
wonder; and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it, certainly
nothing to be regretted. No, it was not regret which made Anne's heart
beat in spite of herself, and brought the colour into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) cheeks when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had some
feelings which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was ashamed to investigate. They were too much like
joy, senseless joy!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) longed to see the Crofts; but when the meeting took place, it was
evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them. The visit of
ceremony was paid and returned; and Louisa Musgrove was mentioned, and
Captain Benwick, too, without even half a smile.

<p/>The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street, perfectly
to Sir Walter's satisfaction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was not at all ashamed of the
acquaintance, and did, in fact, think and talk a great deal more about
the Admiral, than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>).

<p/>The Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for, and
considered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form,
and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure. They brought
with them their country habit of being almost always together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) was
ordered to walk to keep off the gout, and Mrs Croft seemed to go shares
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) in everything, and to walk for her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) life to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) good. Anne
saw them wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went. Lady Russell took her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) carriage
almost every morning, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) never failed to think of them, and never
failed to see them. Knowing their feelings as she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) did, it was a most
attractive picture of happiness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) always watched them as
long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) could, delighted to fancy she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) understood what they might be
talking of, as they walked along in happy independence, or equally
delighted to see the Admiral's hearty shake of the hand when he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>)
encountered an old friend, and observe their eagerness of conversation
when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy, Mrs Croft
looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>).

<p/>Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking
herself; but it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days
after the Croft's arrival, it suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) best to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) friend, or
her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) friend's carriage, in the lower part of the town, and return alone
to Camden Place, and in walking up Milsom Street she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) had the good
fortune to meet with the Admiral. He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) was standing by himself at a
printshop window, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>), in earnest contemplation
of some print, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) not only might have passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) unseen, but was
obliged to touch as well as address him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) could catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>)
notice. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) did perceive and acknowledge her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>), however, it was done
with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) usual frankness and good humour. <div class="bookquote">``Ha! is it you? Thank
you, thank you. This is treating me like a friend. Here I am, you
see, staring at a picture. I can never get by this shop without
stopping. But what a thing here is, by way of a boat! Do look at it.
Did you ever see the like? What queer fellows your fine painters must
be, to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless
old cockleshell as that? And yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it
mightily at their ease, and looking about them at the rocks and
mountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment, which they
certainly must be. I wonder where that boat was built!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-laughing
heartily-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``I would not venture over a horsepond in it. Well,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-turning away-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``now, where are you bound? Can I go anywhere for you,
or with you? Can I be of any use?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None, I thank you, unless you will give me the pleasure of your
company the little way our road lies together. I am going home.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I will, with all my heart, and farther, too. Yes, yes we will
have a snug walk together, and I have something to tell you as we go
along. There, take my arm; that's right; I do not feel comfortable if
I have not a woman there. Lord! what a boat it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>taking a last look
at the picture, as they began to be in motion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you say that you had something to tell me, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes, I have, presently. But here comes a friend, Captain Brigden; I
shall only say, ``How d'ye do?'' as we pass, however. I shall not stop.
``How d'ye do?<div class="bookquote">'' Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), poor soul, is tied by the leg. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has a blister on one of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
heels, as large as a three-shilling piece. If you look across the
street, you will see Admiral Brand coming down and his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) brother. Shabby
fellows, both of them! I am glad they are not on this side of the way.
Sophy cannot bear them. They played me a pitiful trick once: got away
with some of my best men. I will tell you the whole story another
time. There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) grandson. Look, he (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>)
sees us; he (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) kisses his (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) hand to you; he (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) takes you for my wife. Ah! the
peace has come too soon for that younker. Poor old Sir Archibald! How
do you like Bath, Miss Elliot? It suits us very well. We are always
meeting with some old friend or other; the streets full of them every
morning; sure to have plenty of chat; and then we get away from them
all, and shut ourselves in our lodgings, and draw in our chairs, and
are as snug as if we were at Kellynch, ay, or as we used to be even at
North Yarmouth and Deal. We do not like our lodgings here the worse, I
can tell you, for putting us in mind of those we first had at North
Yarmouth. The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same
way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>When they were got a little farther, Anne ventured to press again for
what he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) had to communicate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hoped when clear of Milsom Street to
have her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) curiosity gratified; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was still obliged to wait, for
the Admiral had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) mind not to begin till they had gained the
greater space and quiet of Belmont; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was not really Mrs
Croft, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must let him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) have his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) own way. As soon as they were fairly
ascending Belmont, he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) began--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now you shall hear something that will surprise you. But first
of all, you must tell me the name of the young lady I am going to talk
about. That young lady, you know, that we have all been so concerned
for. The Miss Musgrove, that all this has been happening to. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)
Christian name: I always forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) Christian name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) really
did; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could safely suggest the name of <div class="bookquote">``Louisa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, Miss Louisa Musgrove, that is the name. I wish young ladies
had not such a number of fine Christian names. I should never be out
if they were all Sophys, or something of that sort. Well, this Miss
Louisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry Frederick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) was
courting her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) week after week. The only wonder was, what they could be
waiting for, till the business at Lyme came; then, indeed, it was clear
enough that they must wait till her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) brain was set to right. But even
then there was something odd in their way of going on. Instead of
staying at Lyme, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) went off to Plymouth, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) went off to see
Edward. When we came back from Minehead he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) was gone down to Edward's,
and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) has been ever since. We have seen nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) since
November. Even Sophy could not understand it. But now, the matter has
taken the strangest turn of all; for this young lady, the same Miss
Musgrove, instead of being to marry Frederick, is to marry James
Benwick. You know James Benwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little. I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) is to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>). Nay, most likely they are married already,
for I do not know what they should wait for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Anne, <div class="bookquote">``and
I understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) bears an excellent character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes, yes, there is not a word to be said against James Benwick.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are bad
times for getting on, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) has not another fault that I know of. An
excellent, good-hearted fellow, I assure you; a very active, zealous
officer too, which is more than you would think for, perhaps, for that
soft sort of manner does not do him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) justice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed you are mistaken there, sir; I should never augur want of
spirit from Captain Benwick's manners. I thought them particularly
pleasing, and I will answer for it, they would generally please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, ladies are the best judges; but James Benwick is rather
too piano for me; and though very likely it is all our partiality,
Sophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick's manners better than his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>).
There is something about Frederick more to our taste.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne was caught. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had only meant to oppose the too common idea of
spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other, not at all to
represent Captain Benwick's manners as the very best that could
possibly be; and, after a little hesitation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was beginning to say,
<div class="bookquote">``I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but the
Admiral interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) with--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the thing is certainly true. It is not a mere bit of gossip. We
have it from Frederick himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) sister had a letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>)
yesterday, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) tells us of it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) had just had it in a
letter from Harville, written upon the spot, from Uppercross. I fancy
they are all at Uppercross.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said,
therefore, <div class="bookquote">``I hope, Admiral, I hope there is nothing in the style of
Captain Wentworth's letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly
uneasy. It did seem, last autumn, as if there were an attachment
between him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) and Louisa Musgrove; but I hope it may be understood to
have worn out on each side equally, and without violence. I hope his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur from
beginning to end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne looked down to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) has too much
spirit for that. If the girl likes another man better, it is very fit
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should have him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. But what I mean is, that I hope there is nothing in
Captain Wentworth's manner of writing to make you suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) thinks
himself ill-used by his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) friend, which might appear, you know, without
its being absolutely said. I should be very sorry that such a
friendship as has subsisted between him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) and Captain Benwick should be
destroyed, or even wounded, by a circumstance of this sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes, yes, I understand you. But there is nothing at all of that
nature in the letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) does not give the least fling at Benwick;
does not so much as say, ``I wonder at it, I have a reason of my own for
wondering at it.<div class="bookquote">'' No, you would not guess, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) way of writing,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) had ever thought of this Miss -LRB-what's her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) name?-RRB- for himself.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) very handsomely hopes they will be happy together; and there is
nothing very unforgiving in that, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant to
convey, but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) therefore satisfied herself with common-place remarks or quiet
attention, and the Admiral had it all his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) own way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Frederick!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) at last. <div class="bookquote">``Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) must begin all over again
with somebody else. I think we must get him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) to Bath. Sophy must
write, and beg him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) to come to Bath. Here are pretty girls enough, I am
sure. It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again, for that other
Miss Musgrove, I find, is bespoke by her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) cousin, the young parson. Do
not you think, Miss Elliot, we had better try to get him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) to Bath?''



 (<font color='red'><b>Admiral</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 19


<p/>While Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne, and expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>)
wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath, Captain Wentworth was
already on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) way thither. Before Mrs Croft had written, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was
arrived, and the very next time Anne walked out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>).

<p/>Mr Elliot was attending his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) two cousins and Mrs Clay. They were in
Milsom Street. It began to rain, not much, but enough to make shelter
desirable for women, and quite enough to make it very desirable for
Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in Lady
Dalrymple's carriage, which was seen waiting at a little distance; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>),
Anne, and Mrs Clay, therefore, turned into Molland's, while Mr Elliot
stepped to Lady Dalrymple, to request her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) assistance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) soon joined
them again, successful, of course; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy
to take them home, and would call for them in a few minutes.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) ladyship's carriage was a barouche, and did not hold more than four
with any comfort. Miss Carteret was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carteret</b></font>) mother; consequently it
was not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three Camden
Place ladies. There could be no doubt as to Miss Elliot. Whoever
suffered inconvenience, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) must suffer none, but it occupied a little
time to settle the point of civility between the other two. The rain
was a mere trifle, and Anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with
Mr Elliot. But the rain was also a mere trifle to Mrs Clay; she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) would
hardly allow it even to drop at all, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) boots were so thick! much
thicker than Miss Anne's; and, in short, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) civility rendered her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
quite as anxious to be left to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be,
and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so
determined, that the others were obliged to settle it for them; Miss
Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay had a little cold already, and Mr
Elliot deciding on appeal, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) cousin Anne's boots were rather the
thickest.

<p/>It was fixed accordingly, that Mrs Clay should be of the party in the
carriage; and they had just reached this point, when Anne, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sat
near the window, descried, most decidedly and distinctly, Captain
Wentworth walking down the street.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) start was perceptible only to herself; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) instantly felt that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was the greatest simpleton in the world, the most unaccountable and
absurd! For a few minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw nothing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>); it was all
confusion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was lost, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had scolded back her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) senses, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
found the others still waiting for the carriage, and Mr Elliot -LRB-always
obliging-RRB- just setting off for Union Street on a commission of Mrs
Clay's.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door; she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) wanted to
see if it rained. Why was she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) to suspect herself of another motive?
Captain Wentworth must be out of sight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) seat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) would
go; one half of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) should not be always so much wiser than the other
half, or always suspecting the other of being worse than it was. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>)
would see if it rained. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) was sent back, however, in a moment by the
entrance of Captain Wentworth himself, among a party of gentlemen and
ladies, evidently his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) acquaintance, and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) must have joined a
little below Milsom Street. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was more obviously struck and confused
by the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) than she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) had ever observed before; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) looked quite
red. For the first time, since their renewed acquaintance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) felt
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) was betraying the least sensibility of the two. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) had the
advantage of him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) in the preparation of the last few moments. All the
overpowering, blinding, bewildering, first effects of strong surprise
were over with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>). Still, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) had enough to feel! It was
agitation, pain, pleasure, a something between delight and misery.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>), and then turned away. The character of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) manner was
embarrassment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) could not have called it either cold or friendly,
or anything so certainly as embarrassed.

<p/>After a short interval, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) came towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>), and spoke again.
Mutual enquiries on common subjects passed: neither of them, probably,
much the wiser for what they heard, and Anne continuing fully sensible
of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) being less at ease than formerly. They had by dint of being so
very much together, got to speak to each other with a considerable
portion of apparent indifference and calmness; but he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) could not do it
now. Time had changed him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), or Louisa had changed him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). There was
consciousness of some sort or other. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) looked very well, not as if he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
had been suffering in health or spirits, and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) talked of Uppercross,
of the Musgroves, nay, even of Louisa, and had even a momentary look of
his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) own arch significance as he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) named her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>); but yet it was Captain
Wentworth not comfortable, not easy, not able to feign that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was.

<p/>It did not surprise, but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth
would not know him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) saw Elizabeth, that Elizabeth saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), that there was complete internal recognition on each side; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was
convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance,
expecting it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had the pain of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister turn away with
unalterable coldness.

<p/>Lady Dalrymple's carriage, for which Miss Elliot was growing very
impatient, now drew up; the servant came in to announce it. It was
beginning to rain again, and altogether there was a delay, and a
bustle, and a talking, which must make all the little crowd in the shop
understand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey Miss Elliot. At
last Miss Elliot and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) friend, unattended but by the servant, -LRB-for
there was no cousin returned-RRB-, were walking off; and Captain Wentworth,
watching them, turned again to Anne, and by manner, rather than words,
was offering his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) services to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am much obliged to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) answer, <div class="bookquote">``but I am not going with
them. The carriage would not accommodate so many. I walk: I prefer
walking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it rains.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! very little, Nothing that I regard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After a moment's pause he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Though I came only yesterday, I have
equipped myself properly for Bath already, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-pointing to a new
umbrella-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``I wish you would make use of it, if you are determined to
walk; though I think it would be more prudent to let me get you a
chair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was very much obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), but declined it all, repeating her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
conviction, that the rain would come to nothing at present, and adding,
<div class="bookquote">``I am only waiting for Mr Elliot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) will be here in a moment, I am
sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in. Captain
Wentworth recollected him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) perfectly. There was no difference between
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme, admiring Anne as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) passed, except in the air and look and manner of the privileged
relation and friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) came in with eagerness, appeared to see and
think only of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), apologised for his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) stay, was grieved to have kept
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) waiting, and anxious to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) away without further loss of time
and before the rain increased; and in another moment they walked off
together, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) arm under his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), a gentle and embarrassed glance, and a
<div class="bookquote">``Good morning to you!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>being all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had time for, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) passed
away.

<p/>As soon as they were out of sight, the ladies of Captain Wentworth's
party began talking of them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Elliot does not dislike his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) cousin, I fancy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no, that is clear enough. One can guess what will happen there.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is always with them; half lives in the family, I believe. What a
very good-looking man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and Miss Atkinson, who dined with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) once at the Wallises, says
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is the most agreeable man she (<font color='blue'><b>Atkinson</b></font>) ever was in company with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Atkinson</b></font>) is pretty, I think; Anne Elliot; very pretty, when one comes to
look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>). It is not the fashion to say so, but I confess I admire
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! so do I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so do I. No comparison. But the men are all wild after Miss
Elliot. Anne is too delicate for them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne would have been particularly obliged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) cousin, if he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would
have walked by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) side all the way to Camden Place, without saying a
word. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had never found it so difficult to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), though
nothing could exceed his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) solicitude and care, and though his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) subjects
were principally such as were wont to be always interesting: praise,
warm, just, and discriminating, of Lady Russell, and insinuations
highly rational against Mrs Clay. But just now she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) could think only of
Captain Wentworth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) could not understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) present feelings,
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) were really suffering much from disappointment or not; and
till that point were settled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) could not be quite herself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas! alas! she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) must
confess to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) was not wise yet.

<p/>Another circumstance very essential for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) to know, was how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
meant to be in Bath; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had not mentioned it, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) could not
recollect it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) might be only passing through. But it was more
probable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) should be come to stay. In that case, so liable as
every body was to meet every body in Bath, Lady Russell would in all
likelihood see him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) somewhere. Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) recollect him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)? How would it
all be?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove
was to marry Captain Benwick. It had cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) something to encounter
Lady Russell's surprise; and now, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) were by any chance to be
thrown into company with Captain Wentworth, her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) imperfect knowledge of
the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>).

<p/>The following morning Anne was out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend, and for the first
hour, in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in vain; but at
last, in returning down Pulteney Street, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) distinguished him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) on the
right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in view the
greater part of the street. There were many other men about him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), many
groups walking the same way, but there was no mistaking him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
looked instinctively at Lady Russell; but not from any mad idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>)
recognising him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) so soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) did herself. No, it was not to be
supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) till they were nearly
opposite. She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) however, from time to time, anxiously; and
when the moment approached which must point him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) out, though not daring
to look again -LRB-for her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) own countenance she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) knew was unfit to be seen-RRB-,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was yet perfectly conscious of Lady Russell's eyes being turned
exactly in the direction for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)--of her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) being, in short, intently
observing him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascination
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) must possess over Lady Russell's mind, the difficulty it must be for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) to withdraw her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) eyes, the astonishment she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) must be feeling that
eight or nine years should have passed over him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and in foreign climes
and in active service too, without robbing him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) of one personal grace!

<p/>At last, Lady Russell drew back her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Now, how would she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) speak of
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``what has been fixing my eye so long; but
I was looking after some window-curtains, which Lady Alicia and Mrs
Frankland were telling me of last night. They described the
drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this side of the
way, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest and best hung
of any in Bath, but could not recollect the exact number, and I have
been trying to find out which it could be; but I confess I can see no
curtains hereabouts that answer their description.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain, either at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
friend or herself. The part which provoked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) most, was that in all
this waste of foresight and caution, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) should have lost the right
moment for seeing whether he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) saw them.

<p/>A day or two passed without producing anything. The theatre or the
rooms, where he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough for
the Elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant
stupidity of private parties, in which they were getting more and more
engaged; and Anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation, sick of
knowing nothing, and fancying herself stronger because her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) strength was
not tried, was quite impatient for the concert evening. It was a
concert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple. Of
course they must attend. It was really expected to be a good one, and
Captain Wentworth was very fond of music. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) could only have a few
minutes conversation with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) should be
satisfied; and as to the power of addressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) felt all over
courage if the opportunity occurred. Elizabeth had turned from him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>),
Lady Russell overlooked him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) nerves were strengthened by these
circumstances; she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) owed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) attention.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>);
but in a short hurried call she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) excused herself and put it off, with
the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow. Mrs Smith
gave a most good-humoured acquiescence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By all means,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``only tell me all about it, when you do come.
Who is your party?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne named them all. Mrs Smith made no reply; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was leaving
her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) said, and with an expression half serious, half arch, <div class="bookquote">``Well, I
heartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me to-morrow if
you can come; for I begin to have a foreboding that I may not have many
more visits from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne was startled and confused; but after standing in a moment's
suspense, was obliged, and not sorry to be obliged, to hurry away.



<p/>Chapter 20


<p/>Sir Walter, his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) two daughters, and Mrs Clay, were the earliest of all
their party at the rooms in the evening; and as Lady Dalrymple must be
waited for, they took their station by one of the fires in the Octagon
Room. But hardly were they so settled, when the door opened again, and
Captain Wentworth walked in alone. Anne was the nearest to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), and
making yet a little advance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) instantly spoke. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was preparing
only to bow and pass on, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) gentle <div class="bookquote">``How do you do?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
out of the straight line to stand near her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and make enquiries in
return, in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back
ground. Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew
nothing of their looks, and felt equal to everything which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) believed
right to be done.

<p/>While they were speaking, a whispering between her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father and Elizabeth
caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not distinguish, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must guess the
subject; and on Captain Wentworth's making a distant bow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
comprehended that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father had judged so well as to give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that
simple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was just in time by a
side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself. This,
though late, and reluctant, and ungracious, was yet better than
nothing, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spirits improved.

<p/>After talking, however, of the weather, and Bath, and the concert,
their conversation began to flag, and so little was said at last, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to go every moment, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seemed in
no hurry to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>); and presently with renewed spirit, with a little
smile, a little glow, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme. I am afraid you must
have suffered from the shock, and the more from its not overpowering
you at the time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) assured him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a frightful hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``a frightful day!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) passed
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand across his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes, as if the remembrance were still too painful,
but in a moment, half smiling again, added, <div class="bookquote">``The day has produced some
effects however; has had some consequences which must be considered as
the very reverse of frightful. When you had the presence of mind to
suggest that Benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon,
you could have little idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) being eventually one of those most
concerned in her (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) recovery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I could have none. But it appears--I should hope it would
be a very happy match. There are on both sides good principles and
good temper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), looking not exactly forward; <div class="bookquote">``but there, I think, ends
the resemblance. With all my soul I wish them happy, and rejoice over
every circumstance in favour of it. They have no difficulties to
contend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays. The
Musgroves are behaving like themselves, most honourably and kindly,
only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter's
comfort. All this is much, very much in favour of their happiness;
more than perhaps--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stopped. A sudden recollection seemed to occur, and to give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
some taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne's cheeks and fixing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes on the ground. After clearing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) throat, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
proceeded thus--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I confess that I do think there is a disparity, too great a disparity,
and in a point no less essential than mind. I regard Louisa Musgrove
as a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in
understanding, but Benwick is something more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) is a clever man, a
reading man; and I confess, that I do consider his (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) attaching himself to
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with some surprise. Had it been the effect of gratitude, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>)
learnt to love her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) believed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to be preferring him (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>), it
would have been another thing. But I have no reason to suppose it so.
It seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous,
untaught feeling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) side, and this surprises me. A man like him (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>),
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) situation! with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken! Fanny
Harville was a very superior creature, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) attachment to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
indeed attachment. A man does not recover from such a devotion of the
heart to such a woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought not; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Either from the consciousness, however, that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) friend had recovered,
or from other consciousness, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went no farther; and Anne who, in spite
of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered, and in
spite of all the various noises of the room, the almost ceaseless slam
of the door, and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through, had
distinguished every word, was struck, gratified, confused, and
beginning to breathe very quick, and feel an hundred things in a
moment. It was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to enter on such a subject; and yet,
after a pause, feeling the necessity of speaking, and having not the
smallest wish for a total change, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) only deviated so far as to say--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were a good while at Lyme, I think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About a fortnight. I could not leave it till Louisa's doing well was
quite ascertained. I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to
be soon at peace. It had been my doing, solely mine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) would not
have been obstinate if I had not been weak. The country round Lyme is
very fine. I walked and rode a great deal; and the more I saw, the
more I found to admire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should very much like to see Lyme again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! I should not have supposed that you could have found anything
in Lyme to inspire such a feeling. The horror and distress you were
involved in, the stretch of mind, the wear of spirits! I should have
thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been strong disgust.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The last hours were certainly very painful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>replied Anne; <div class="bookquote">``but when
pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure. One does
not love a place the less for having suffered in it, unless it has been
all suffering, nothing but suffering, which was by no means the case at
Lyme. We were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours,
and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment. So much
novelty and beauty! I have travelled so little, that every fresh place
would be interesting to me; but there is real beauty at Lyme; and in
short''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>-LRB-with a faint blush at some recollections-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``altogether my
impressions of the place are very agreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ceased, the entrance door opened again, and the very party
appeared for whom they were waiting. <div class="bookquote">``Lady Dalrymple, Lady Dalrymple,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div>was the rejoicing sound; and with all the eagerness compatible with
anxious elegance, Sir Walter and his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) two ladies stepped forward to meet
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, escorted by Mr Elliot and
Colonel Wallis, who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant,
advanced into the room. The others joined them, and it was a group in
which Anne found herself also necessarily included. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was divided
from Captain Wentworth. Their interesting, almost too interesting
conversation must be broken up for a time, but slight was the penance
compared with the happiness which brought it on! She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had learnt, in
the last ten minutes, more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) feelings towards Louisa, more of all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) feelings than she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) dared to think of; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) gave herself up to the
demands of the party, to the needful civilities of the moment, with
exquisite, though agitated sensations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) was in good humour with
all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) had received ideas which disposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) to be courteous and
kind to all, and to pity every one, as being less happy than herself.

<p/>The delightful emotions were a little subdued, when on stepping back
from the group, to be joined again by Captain Wentworth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) saw that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) was just in time to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) turn into the Concert
Room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was gone; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had disappeared, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) felt a moment's regret.
But <div class="bookquote">``they should meet again. He (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) would look for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) would find her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>)
out before the evening were over, and at present, perhaps, it was as
well to be asunder. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) was in need of a little interval for
recollection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Russell</b></font>)</div><p/>Upon Lady Russell's appearance soon afterwards, the whole party was
collected, and all that remained was to marshal themselves, and proceed
into the Concert Room; and be of all the consequence in their power,
draw as many eyes, excite as many whispers, and disturb as many people
as they could.

<p/>Very, very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in.
Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret, and looking on the broad back
of the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), had nothing to wish
for which did not seem within her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) reach; and Anne--but it would be an
insult to the nature of Anne's felicity, to draw any comparison between
it and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sister's; the origin of one all selfish vanity, of the other
all generous attachment.

<p/>Anne saw nothing, thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
happiness was from within. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes were bright and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) cheeks glowed;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew nothing about it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was thinking only of the last half
hour, and as they passed to their seats, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mind took a hasty range
over it. His (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) choice of subjects, his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) expressions, and still more his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
manner and look, had been such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could see in only one light. His (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
opinion of Louisa Musgrove's inferiority, an opinion which he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had
seemed solicitous to give, his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wonder at Captain Benwick, his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) feelings
as to a first, strong attachment; sentences begun which he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could not
finish, his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance,
all, all declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had a heart returning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) at least; that
anger, resentment, avoidance, were no more; and that they were
succeeded, not merely by friendship and regard, but by the tenderness
of the past. Yes, some share of the tenderness of the past. She (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) could
not contemplate the change as implying less. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) must love her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>).

<p/>These were thoughts, with their attendant visions, which occupied and
flurried her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) too much to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) any power of observation; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)
passed along the room without having a glimpse of him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), without even
trying to discern him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). When their places were determined on, and they
were all properly arranged, she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) looked round to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) should happen
to be in the same part of the room, but he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was not; her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) eye could not
reach him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>); and the concert being just opening, she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) must consent for a
time to be happy in a humbler way.

<p/>The party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches: Anne
was among those on the foremost, and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so well,
with the assistance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) friend Colonel Wallis, as to have a seat by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>). Miss Elliot, surrounded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) cousins, and the principal object
of Colonel Wallis's gallantry, was quite contented.

<p/>Anne's mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the
evening; it was just occupation enough: she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had feelings for the
tender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific, and patience
for the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better, at least
during the first act. Towards the close of it, in the interval
succeeding an Italian song, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) explained the words of the song to Mr
Elliot. They had a concert bill between them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the
words, for certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not be
talked of, but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give; for I do not
pretend to understand the language. I am a very poor Italian scholar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, I see you are. I see you know nothing of the matter. You
have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these
inverted, transposed, curtailed Italian lines, into clear,
comprehensible, elegant English. You need not say anything more of
your ignorance. Here is complete proof.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not oppose such kind politeness; but I should be sorry to be
examined by a real proficient.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot; and I do
regard her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) as one who is too modest for the world in general to be
aware of half her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) accomplishments, and too highly accomplished for
modesty to be natural in any other woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For shame! for shame! this is too much flattery. I forget what we are
to have next,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>turning to the bill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Mr Elliot, speaking low, <div class="bookquote">``I have had a longer
acquaintance with your character than you are aware of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! How so? You can have been acquainted with it only since I
came to Bath, excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my
own family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew you by report long before you came to Bath. I had heard you
described by those who knew you intimately. I have been acquainted
with you by character many years. Your person, your disposition,
accomplishments, manner; they were all present to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) hoped to raise. No
one can withstand the charm of such a mystery. To have been described
long ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people, is irresistible;
and Anne was all curiosity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wondered, and questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) eagerly;
but in vain. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) delighted in being asked, but he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) would not tell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, some time or other, perhaps, but not now. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) would mention no
names now; but such, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) could assure her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), had been the fact. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had
many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot as had
inspired him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) with the highest idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) merit, and excited the
warmest curiosity to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford, Captain Wentworth's
brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) might have been in Mr Elliot's company, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had not
courage to ask the question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The name of Anne Elliot,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``has long had an interesting sound
to me. Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I
dared, I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Such, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) believed, were his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) words; but scarcely had she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) received their
sound, than her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), which rendered every thing else trivial. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father and Lady
Dalrymple were speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A well-looking man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Sir Walter, <div class="bookquote">``a very well-looking man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A very fine young man indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Dalrymple</b></font>)</div>said Lady Dalrymple. <div class="bookquote">``More air than
one often sees in Bath. Irish, I dare say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I just know his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name. A bowing acquaintance. Wentworth; Captain
Wentworth of the navy. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) sister married my tenant in Somersetshire,
the Croft, who rents Kellynch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Before Sir Walter had reached this point, Anne's eyes had caught the
right direction, and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing among a
cluster of men at a little distance. As her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes fell on him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
seemed to be withdrawn from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). It had that appearance. It seemed as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been one moment too late; and as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) dared observe,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) did not look again: but the performance was recommencing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
was forced to seem to restore her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) attention to the orchestra and look
straight forward.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could give another glance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had moved away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) could not
have come nearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) would; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was so surrounded and shut in:
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would rather have caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) eye.

<p/>Mr Elliot's speech, too, distressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had no longer any
inclination to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) not so near her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/>The first act was over. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hoped for some beneficial change; and,
after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party, some of them did
decide on going in quest of tea. Anne was one of the few who did not
choose to move. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) remained in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) seat, and so did Lady Russell; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not mean,
whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) might feel on Lady Russell's account, to shrink from
conversation with Captain Wentworth, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) the opportunity.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was persuaded by Lady Russell's countenance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) did not come however. Anne sometimes fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) discerned him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) at a
distance, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) never came. The anxious interval wore away
unproductively. The others returned, the room filled again, benches
were reclaimed and repossessed, and another hour of pleasure or of
penance was to be sat out, another hour of music was to give delight or
the gapes, as real or affected taste for it prevailed. To Anne, it
chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not quit
that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth once more, without
the interchange of one friendly look.

<p/>In re-settling themselves there were now many changes, the result of
which was favourable for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Colonel Wallis declined sitting down
again, and Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret, in a
manner not to be refused, to sit between them; and by some other
removals, and a little scheming of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carteret</b></font>) own, Anne was enabled to place
herself much nearer the end of the bench than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been before, much
more within reach of a passer-by. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not do so, without
comparing herself with Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles; but
still she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did it, and not with much happier effect; though by what
seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) next
neighbours, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found herself at the very end of the bench before the
concert closed.

<p/>Such was her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) situation, with a vacant space at hand, when Captain
Wentworth was again in sight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) not far off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
too; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow
degrees came at last near enough to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt that
something must be the matter. The change was indubitable. The
difference between his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) present air and what it had been in the Octagon
Room was strikingly great. Why was it? She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father, of
Lady Russell. Could there have been any unpleasant glances? He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) began
by speaking of the concert gravely, more like the Captain Wentworth of
Uppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing; and in
short, must confess that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) should not be sorry when it was over. Anne
replied, and spoke in defence of the performance so well, and yet in
allowance for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) feelings so pleasantly, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) countenance
improved, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) replied again with almost a smile. They talked for a
few minutes more; the improvement held; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) even looked down towards the
bench, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) saw a place on it well worth occupying; when at that
moment a touch on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) shoulder obliged Anne to turn round. It came
from Mr Elliot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) pardon, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must be applied to, to
explain Italian again. Miss Carteret was very anxious to have a
general idea of what was next to be sung. Anne could not refuse; but
never had she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit.

<p/>A few minutes, though as few as possible, were inevitably consumed; and
when her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own mistress again, when able to turn and look as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had done
before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth, in a reserved
yet hurried sort of farewell. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Kellynch</b></font>) must wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) good night; he (<font color='blue'><b>Kellynch</b></font>) was
going; he (<font color='blue'><b>Kellynch</b></font>) should get home as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Kellynch</b></font>) could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is not this song worth staying for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Anne, suddenly struck by an
idea which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) yet more anxious to be encouraging.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) replied impressively, <div class="bookquote">``there is nothing worth my staying for;''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was gone directly.

<p/>Jealousy of Mr Elliot! It was the only intelligible motive. Captain
Wentworth jealous of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) affection! Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) have believed it a week
ago; three hours ago! For a moment the gratification was exquisite.
But, alas! there were very different thoughts to succeed. How was such
jealousy to be quieted? How was the truth to reach him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)? How, in all
the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations, would he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
ever learn of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) real sentiments? It was misery to think of Mr
Elliot's attentions. Their evil was incalculable.



<p/>Chapter 21


<p/>Anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) promise of going to
Mrs Smith, meaning that it should engage her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) from home at the time when
Mr Elliot would be most likely to call; for to avoid Mr Elliot was
almost a first object.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt a great deal of good-will towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>). In spite of the
mischief of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) attentions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) owed him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) gratitude and regard, perhaps
compassion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not help thinking much of the extraordinary
circumstances attending their acquaintance, of the right which he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
seemed to have to interest her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), by everything in situation, by his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) own
sentiments, by his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) early prepossession. It was altogether very
extraordinary; flattering, but painful. There was much to regret. How
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case,
was not worth enquiry; for there was a Captain Wentworth; and be the
conclusion of the present suspense good or bad, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) affection would be
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) for ever. Their union, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) believed, could not divide her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) more
from other men, than their final separation.

<p/>Prettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy, could
never have passed along the streets of Bath, than Anne was sporting
with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings. It was almost enough to
spread purification and perfume all the way.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was sure of a pleasant reception; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend seemed this
morning particularly obliged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) for coming, seemed hardly to have
expected her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), though it had been an appointment.

<p/>An account of the concert was immediately claimed; and Anne's
recollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
features and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) rejoice to talk of it. All that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could tell
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) told most gladly, but the all was little for one who had been
there, and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith, who had
already heard, through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter,
rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than Anne
could relate, and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the
company. Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath was well
know by name to Mrs Smith.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The little Durands were there, I conclude,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``with their
mouths open to catch the music, like unfledged sparrows ready to be
fed. They never miss a concert.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I did not see them myself, but I heard Mr Elliot say they were in
the room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Ibbotsons, were they there? and the two new beauties, with the
tall Irish officer, who is talked of for one of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know. I do not think they were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Old Lady Mary Maclean? I need not ask after her (<font color='blue'><b>Maclean</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maclean</b></font>) never misses, I
know; and you must have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Maclean</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maclean</b></font>) must have been in your own
circle; for as you went with Lady Dalrymple, you were in the seats of
grandeur, round the orchestra, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, that was what I dreaded. It would have been very unpleasant to me
in every respect. But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses to be
farther off; and we were exceedingly well placed, that is, for hearing;
I must not say for seeing, because I appear to have seen very little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! you saw enough for your own amusement. I can understand. There
is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd, and this
you had. You were a large party in yourselves, and you wanted nothing
beyond.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I ought to have looked about me more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Anne, conscious while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about, that
the object only had been deficient.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; you were better employed. You need not tell me that you had a
pleasant evening. I see it in your eye. I perfectly see how the hours
passed: that you had always something agreeable to listen to. In the
intervals of the concert it was conversation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne half smiled and said, <div class="bookquote">``Do you see that in my eye?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do. Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in
company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in
the world, the person who interests you at this present time more than
all the rest of the world put together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>A blush overspread Anne's cheeks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could say nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And such being the case,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs Smith, after a short pause, <div class="bookquote">``I
hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness in coming to
me this morning. It is really very good of you to come and sit with
me, when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne heard nothing of this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was still in the astonishment and
confusion excited by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend's penetration, unable to imagine how
any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). After another
short silence--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Smith, <div class="bookquote">``is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with
me? Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) know that I am in Bath?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Elliot!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>repeated Anne, looking up surprised. A moment's
reflection shewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) the mistake she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been under. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) caught it
instantaneously; and recovering her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) courage with the feeling of safety,
soon added, more composedly, <div class="bookquote">``Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been a good deal acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs Smith,
gravely, <div class="bookquote">``but it seems worn out now. It is a great while since we met.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not at all aware of this. You never mentioned it before. Had I
known it, I would have had the pleasure of talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) about you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To confess the truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Smith, assuming her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) usual air of
cheerfulness, <div class="bookquote">``that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have. I want
you to talk about me to Mr Elliot. I want your interest with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
can be of essential service to me; and if you would have the goodness,
my dear Miss Elliot, to make it an object to yourself, of course it is
done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be extremely happy; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness to
be of even the slightest use to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>replied Anne; <div class="bookquote">``but I suspect that
you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot, a greater
right to influence him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), than is really the case. I am sure you have,
somehow or other, imbibed such a notion. You must consider me only as
Mr Elliot's relation. If in that light there is anything which you
suppose his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) cousin might fairly ask of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), I beg you would not
hesitate to employ me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs Smith gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) a penetrating glance, and then, smiling, said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been a little premature, I perceive; I beg your pardon. I
ought to have waited for official information. But now, my dear Miss
Elliot, as an old friend, do give me a hint as to when I may speak.
Next week? To be sure by next week I may be allowed to think it all
settled, and build my own selfish schemes on Mr Elliot's good fortune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>replied Anne, <div class="bookquote">``nor next week, nor next, nor next. I assure you
that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week.
I am not going to marry Mr Elliot. I should like to know why you
imagine I am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs Smith looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) again, looked earnestly, smiled, shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
head, and exclaimed--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, how I do wish I understood you! How I do wish I knew what you
were at! I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel, when
the right moment occurs. Till it does come, you know, we women never
mean to have anybody. It is a thing of course among us, that every man
is refused, till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) offers. But why should you be cruel? Let me plead
for my--present friend I cannot call him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), but for my former friend.
Where can you look for a more suitable match? Where could you expect a
more gentlemanlike, agreeable man? Let me recommend Mr Elliot. I am
sure you hear nothing but good of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) from Colonel Wallis; and who can
know him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) better than Colonel Wallis?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Mrs Smith, Mr Elliot's wife has not been dead much above half
a year. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) ought not to be supposed to be paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) addresses to any
one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! if these are your only objections,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Smith, archly, <div class="bookquote">``Mr
Elliot is safe, and I shall give myself no more trouble about him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>). Do
not forget me when you are married, that's all. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) know me to be
a friend of yours, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) will think little of the trouble
required, which it is very natural for him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) now, with so many affairs
and engagements of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) own, to avoid and get rid of as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) can; very
natural, perhaps. Ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same. Of
course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) cannot be aware of the importance to me. Well, my dear Miss
Elliot, I hope and trust you will be very happy. Mr Elliot has sense
to understand the value of such a woman. Your peace will not be
shipwrecked as mine has been. You are safe in all worldly matters, and
safe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) character. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) will not be led astray; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) will not be
misled by others to his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) ruin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Anne, <div class="bookquote">``I can readily believe all that of my cousin. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
seems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open to dangerous
impressions. I consider him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) with great respect. I have no reason,
from any thing that has fallen within my observation, to do otherwise.
But I have not known him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) long; and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is not a man, I think, to be
known intimately soon. Will not this manner of speaking of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Mrs
Smith, convince you that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is nothing to me? Surely this must be calm
enough. And, upon my word, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is nothing to me. Should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ever
propose to me -LRB-which I have very little reason to imagine he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has any
thought of doing-RRB-, I shall not accept him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I assure you I shall not.
I assure you, Mr Elliot had not the share which you have been
supposing, in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford:
not Mr Elliot; it is not Mr Elliot that--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) stopped, regretting with a deep blush that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had implied so much;
but less would hardly have been sufficient. Mrs Smith would hardly
have believed so soon in Mr Elliot's failure, but from the perception
of there being a somebody else. As it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) instantly submitted,
and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and Anne, eager to
escape farther notice, was impatient to know why Mrs Smith should have
fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was to marry Mr Elliot; where she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could have received the
idea, or from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could have heard it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do tell me how it first came into your head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It first came into my head,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs Smith, <div class="bookquote">``upon finding how much
you were together, and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the
world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you; and you
may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in
the same way. But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And has it indeed been spoken of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called
yesterday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Was not it Mrs Speed, as usual, or the maid? I observed no one
in particular.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was my friend Mrs Rooke; Nurse Rooke; who, by-the-bye, had a great
curiosity to see you, and was delighted to be in the way to let you in.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Rooke</b></font>) came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rooke</b></font>) it was
who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rooke</b></font>) had had it from Mrs
Wallis herself, which did not seem bad authority. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) sat an hour with
me on Monday evening, and gave me the whole history.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The whole
history,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>repeated Anne, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) could not make a very long
history, I think, of one such little article of unfounded news.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs Smith said nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>continued Anne, presently, <div class="bookquote">``though there is no truth in my
having this claim on Mr Elliot, I should be extremely happy to be of
use to you in any way that I could. Shall I mention to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) your being
in Bath? Shall I take any message?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I thank you: no, certainly not. In the warmth of the moment, and
under a mistaken impression, I might, perhaps, have endeavoured to
interest you in some circumstances; but not now. No, I thank you, I
have nothing to trouble you with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not before he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was married, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was not married when I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And--were you much acquainted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Intimately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! Then do tell me what he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was at that time of life. I have a
great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
at all such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) appears now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>was Mrs Smith's answer,
given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther;
and Anne felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity.
They were both silent: Mrs Smith very thoughtful. At last--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, my dear Miss Elliot,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) cried, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) natural
tone of cordiality, <div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon for the short answers I have
been giving you, but I have been uncertain what I ought to do. I have
been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you. There
were many things to be taken into the account. One hates to be
officious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief. Even the
smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving, though there may
be nothing durable beneath. However, I have determined; I think I am
right; I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr Elliot's real
character. Though I fully believe that, at present, you have not the
smallest intention of accepting him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), there is no saying what may
happen. You might, some time or other, be differently affected towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>). Hear the truth, therefore, now, while you are unprejudiced. Mr
Elliot is a man without heart or conscience; a designing, wary,
cold-blooded being, who thinks only of himself; whom for his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) own
interest or ease, would be guilty of any cruelty, or any treachery,
that could be perpetrated without risk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) general character. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
has no feeling for others. Those whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) has been the chief cause of
leading into ruin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) can neglect and desert without the smallest
compunction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of
justice or compassion. Oh! he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is black at heart, hollow and black!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne's astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) pause, and
in a calmer manner, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) added,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My expressions startle you. You must allow for an injured, angry
woman. But I will try to command myself. I will not abuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>). I
will only tell you what I have found him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>). Facts shall speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was
the intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), and
thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) as good as himself. The intimacy had been formed before
our marriage. I found them most intimate friends; and I, too, became
excessively pleased with Mr Elliot, and entertained the highest opinion
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>). At nineteen, you know, one does not think very seriously; but
Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others, and much more
agreeable than most others, and we were almost always together. We
were principally in town, living in very good style. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was then the
inferior in circumstances; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was then the poor one; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had chambers in
the Temple, and it was as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) could do to support the appearance
of a gentleman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had always a home with us whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) chose it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
was always welcome; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was like a brother. My poor Charles, who had
the finest, most generous spirit in the world, would have divided his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
last farthing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>); and I know that his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) purse was open to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>); I
know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) often assisted him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot's life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>said
Anne, <div class="bookquote">``which has always excited my particular curiosity. It must have
been about the same time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) became known to my father and sister.
I never knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) myself; I only heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>); but there was a something
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) conduct then, with regard to my father and sister, and
afterwards in the circumstances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) marriage, which I never could
quite reconcile with present times. It seemed to announce a different
sort of man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it all, I know it all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Smith. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been
introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speak of them for ever. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was invited and
encouraged, and I know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not choose to go. I can satisfy you,
perhaps, on points which you would little expect; and as to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
marriage, I knew all about it at the time. I was privy to all the fors
and againsts; I was the friend to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) confided his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hopes and plans;
and though I did not know his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife previously, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) inferior situation
in society, indeed, rendered that impossible, yet I knew her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
life afterwards, or at least till within the last two years of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
life, and can answer any question you may wish to put.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Anne, <div class="bookquote">``I have no particular enquiry to make about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). I
have always understood they were not a happy couple. But I should like
to know why, at that time of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) life, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should slight my father's
acquaintance as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did. My father was certainly disposed to take very
kind and proper notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Why did Mr Elliot draw back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Elliot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs Smith, <div class="bookquote">``at that period of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) life, had one
object in view: to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) fortune, and by a rather quicker process
than the law. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was determined to make it by marriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was
determined, at least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage; and I
know it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) belief -LRB-whether justly or not, of course I cannot
decide-RRB-, that your father and sister, in their civilities and
invitations, were designing a match between the heir and the young
lady, and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
ideas of wealth and independence. That was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) motive for drawing
back, I can assure you. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told me the whole story. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had no
concealments with me. It was curious, that having just left you behind
me in Bath, my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be
your cousin; and that, through him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), I should be continually hearing of
your father and sister. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) described one Miss Elliot, and I thought
very affectionately of the other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>cried Anne, struck by a sudden idea, <div class="bookquote">``you sometimes spoke of
me to Mr Elliot?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure I did; very often. I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot,
and vouch for your being a very different creature from--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) checked herself just in time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>cried
Anne. <div class="bookquote">``This explains it. I found he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had been used to hear of me. I
could not comprehend how. What wild imaginations one forms where dear
self is concerned! How sure to be mistaken! But I beg your pardon; I
have interrupted you. Mr Elliot married then completely for money?
The circumstances, probably, which first opened your eyes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs Smith hesitated a little here. ``Oh! those things are too common.
When one lives in the world, a man or woman's marrying for money is too
common to strike one as it ought. I was very young, and associated
only with the young, and we were a thoughtless, gay set, without any
strict rules of conduct. We lived for enjoyment. I think differently
now; time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions; but at
that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what Mr Elliot
was doing. ``To do the best for himself,<div class="bookquote">'' passed as a duty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But was not she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a very low woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; which I objected to, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) would not regard. Money, money, was
all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) wanted. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father was a grazier, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grandfather had been
a butcher, but that was all nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a fine woman, had had a
decent education, was brought forward by some cousins, thrown by chance
into Mr Elliot's company, and fell in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>); and not a
difficulty or a scruple was there on his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) side, with respect to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
birth. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) caution was spent in being secured of the real amount
of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fortune, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) committed himself. Depend upon it, whatever
esteem Mr Elliot may have for his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) own situation in life now, as a young
man he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had not the smallest value for it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) chance for the Kellynch
estate was something, but all the honour of the family he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) held as cheap
as dirt. I have often heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) declare, that if baronetcies were
saleable, anybody should have his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) for fifty pounds, arms and motto,
name and livery included; but I will not pretend to repeat half that I
used to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) say on that subject. It would not be fair; and yet
you ought to have proof, for what is all this but assertion, and you
shall have proof.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, my dear Mrs Smith, I want none,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>cried Anne. <div class="bookquote">``You have
asserted nothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some
years ago. This is all in confirmation, rather, of what we used to
hear and believe. I am more curious to know why he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) should be so
different now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring for
Mary; stay: I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of
going yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box
which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was
desired. The box was brought and placed before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and Mrs Smith,
sighing over it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) unlocked it, said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is full of papers belonging to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), to my husband; a small
portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>). The letter I
am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) before our marriage,
and happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was
careless and immethodical, like other men, about those things; and when
I came to examine his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) papers, I found it with others still more
trivial, from different people scattered here and there, while many
letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed. Here it
is; I would not burn it, because being even then very little satisfied
with Mr Elliot, I was determined to preserve every document of former
intimacy. I have now another motive for being glad that I can produce
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This was the letter, directed to <div class="bookquote">``Charles Smith, Esq.. Tunbridge Wells,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and dated from London, as far back as July, 1803:--

<p/>``Dear Smith,--I have received yours. Your kindness almost overpowers
me. I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common, but I
have lived three-and-twenty years in the world, and have seen none like
it. At present, believe me, I have no need of your services, being in
cash again. Give me joy: I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss.. They
are gone back to Kellynch, and almost made me swear to visit them this
summer; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor, to tell
me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer. The baronet,
nevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again; he (<font color='blue'><b>Kellynch</b></font>) is quite fool enough.
If he (<font color='blue'><b>Kellynch</b></font>) does, however, they will leave me in peace, which may be a decent
equivalent for the reversion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kellynch</b></font>) is worse than last year.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I had any name but Elliot. I am sick of it. The name of
Walter I can drop, thank God! and I desire you will never insult me
with my second W. again, meaning, for the rest of my life, to be only
yours truly,--Wm. Elliot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow; and Mrs
Smith, observing the high colour in her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) face, said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The language, I know, is highly disrespectful. Though I have forgot
the exact terms, I have a perfect impression of the general meaning.
But it shows you the man. Mark his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) professions to my poor husband.
Can any thing be stronger?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of
finding such words applied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was obliged to recollect
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour, that
no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies, that no
private correspondence could bear the eye of others, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could
recover calmness enough to return the letter which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been
meditating over, and say--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. This is full proof undoubtedly; proof of every thing you
were saying. But why be acquainted with us now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can explain this too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Smith, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you really?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was a dozen years ago, and I
will shew him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is now. I cannot produce written proof again, but
I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is
now wanting, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is now doing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is no hypocrite now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
truly wants to marry you. His (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) present attentions to your family are
very sincere: quite from the heart. I will give you my authority: his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
friend Colonel Wallis.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Colonel Wallis! you are acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that; it
takes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence. The stream is as good
as at first; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily
moved away. Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
views on you, which said Colonel Wallis, I imagine to be, in himself, a
sensible, careful, discerning sort of character; but Colonel Wallis has
a very pretty silly wife, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) tells things which he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had better
not, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) repeats it all to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) in the overflowing spirits of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) recovery, repeats it all to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) nurse; and the nurse knowing my
acquaintance with you, very naturally brings it all to me. On Monday
evening, my good friend Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of
Marlborough Buildings. When I talked of a whole history, therefore,
you see I was not romancing so much as you supposed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Mrs Smith, your authority is deficient. This will not do. Mr
Elliot's having any views on me will not in the least account for the
efforts he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) made towards a reconciliation with my father. That was all
prior to my coming to Bath. I found them on the most friendly terms
when I arrived.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you did; I know it all perfectly, but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, Mrs Smith, we must not expect to get real information in such
a line. Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so
many, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another, can
hardly have much truth left.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only give me a hearing. You will soon be able to judge of the general
credit due, by listening to some particulars which you can yourself
immediately contradict or confirm. Nobody supposes that you were his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)
first inducement. He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) had seen you indeed, before he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) came to Bath, and
admired you, but without knowing it to be you. So says my historian,
at least. Is this true? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) see you last summer or autumn,
`somewhere down in the west,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>to use her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) own words, without knowing it
to be you?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) certainly did. So far it is very true. At Lyme. I happened to be
at Lyme.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs Smith, triumphantly, <div class="bookquote">``grant my friend the credit
due to the establishment of the first point asserted. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) saw you then
at Lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet
with you again in Camden Place, as Miss Anne Elliot, and from that
moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) visits there. But
there was another, and an earlier, which I will now explain. If there
is anything in my story which you know to be either false or
improbable, stop me. My account states, that your sister's friend, the
lady now staying with you, whom I have heard you mention, came to Bath
with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September -LRB-in short when
they first came themselves-RRB-, and has been staying there ever since;
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is a clever, insinuating, handsome woman, poor and plausible,
and altogether such in situation and manner, as to give a general idea,
among Sir Walter's acquaintance, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) meaning to be Lady Elliot, and
as general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently, blind to
the danger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Mrs Smith paused a moment; but Anne had not a word to say, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
continued--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family,
long before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) eye upon
your father enough to be sensible of it, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) did not then visit
in Camden Place; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) regard for Mr Elliot gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) an interest in
watching all that was going on there, and when Mr Elliot came to Bath
for a day or two, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) happened to do a little before Christmas,
Colonel Wallis made him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) acquainted with the appearance of things, and
the reports beginning to prevail. Now you are to understand, that time
had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot's opinions as to the
value of a baronetcy. Upon all points of blood and connexion he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is a
completely altered man. Having long had as much money as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) could
spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) has
been gradually learning to pin his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) happiness upon the consequence he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is
heir to. I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased, but it
is now a confirmed feeling. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) cannot bear the idea of not being Sir
William. You may guess, therefore, that the news he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) heard from his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
friend could not be very agreeable, and you may guess what it produced;
the resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of
fixing himself here for a time, with the view of renewing his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) former
acquaintance, and recovering such a footing in the family as might give
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) the means of ascertaining the degree of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) danger, and of
circumventing the lady if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) found it material. This was agreed upon
between the two friends as the only thing to be done; and Colonel
Wallis was to assist in every way that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) could. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was to be
introduced, and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced, and everybody was to
be introduced. Mr Elliot came back accordingly; and on application was
forgiven, as you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it
was his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) constant object, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) only object -LRB-till your arrival added
another motive-RRB-, to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) omitted no
opportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way, called at
all hours; but I need not be particular on this subject. You can
imagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide, perhaps, may
recollect what you have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Anne, <div class="bookquote">``you tell me nothing which does not accord with what
I have known, or could imagine. There is always something offensive in
the details of cunning. The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity
must ever be revolting, but I have heard nothing which really surprises
me. I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr
Elliot, who would have difficulty in believing it; but I have never
been satisfied. I have always wanted some other motive for his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) conduct
than appeared. I should like to know his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) present opinion, as to the
probability of the event he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) has been in dread of; whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) considers
the danger to be lessening or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lessening, I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs Smith. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) thinks Mrs Clay
afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) sees through her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>), and not daring to
proceed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) might do in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) absence. But since he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) must be absent
some time or other, I do not perceive how he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) can ever be secure while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) holds her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) present influence. Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea, as
nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles when
you and Mr Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay. A
scheme, worthy of Mrs Wallis's understanding, by all accounts; but my
sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it. ``Why, to be sure,
ma<div class="bookquote">``am,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), `it would not prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) marrying anybody else.<div class="bookquote">''
And, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) heart, is a
very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter's making a second match. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) must
be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know; and -LRB-since self
will intrude-RRB- who can say that she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) may not have some flying visions of
attending the next Lady Elliot, through Mrs Wallis's recommendation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>anybody</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad to know all this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Anne, after a little
thoughtfulness. <div class="bookquote">``It will be more painful to me in some respects to be
in company with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), but I shall know better what to do. My line of
conduct will be more direct. Mr Elliot is evidently a disingenuous,
artificial, worldly man, who has never had any better principle to
guide him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) than selfishness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mr Elliot was not done with. Mrs Smith had been carried away from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) first direction, and Anne had forgotten, in the interest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own
family concerns, how much had been originally implied against him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>); but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) listened to a recital which, if it did not perfectly justify
the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith, proved him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) to have been very
unfeeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) conduct towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>); very deficient both in justice
and compassion.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) learned that -LRB-the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr
Elliot's marriage-RRB- they had been as before always together, and Mr
Elliot had led his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) friend into expenses much beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) fortune. Mrs
Smith did not want to take blame to herself, and was most tender of
throwing any on her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) husband; but Anne could collect that their income
had never been equal to their style of living, and that from the first
there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance. From
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife's account of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could discern Mr Smith to have been a man
of warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong
understanding, much more amiable than his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) friend, and very unlike him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>),
led by him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), and probably despised by him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>). Mr Elliot, raised by his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
marriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification of
pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself,
-LRB-for with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) self-indulgence he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had become a prudent man-RRB-, and
beginning to be rich, just as his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) friend ought to have found himself to
be poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend's
probable finances, but, on the contrary, had been prompting and
encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the Smiths
accordingly had been ruined.

<p/>The husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of
it. They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the
friendship of their friends, and to prove that Mr Elliot's had better
not be tried; but it was not till his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) death that the wretched state of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) affairs was fully known. With a confidence in Mr Elliot's regard,
more creditable to his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) feelings than his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) judgement, Mr Smith had
appointed him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) the executor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) will; but Mr Elliot would not act,
and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>),
in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) situation, had been
such as could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to
without corresponding indignation.

<p/>Anne was shewn some letters of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) on the occasion, answers to urgent
applications from Mrs Smith, which all breathed the same stern
resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and, under a cold
civility, the same hard-hearted indifference to any of the evils it
might bring on her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>). It was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and
inhumanity; and Anne felt, at some moments, that no flagrant open crime
could have been worse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had a great deal to listen to; all the
particulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae of distress upon
distress, which in former conversations had been merely hinted at, were
dwelt on now with a natural indulgence. Anne could perfectly
comprehend the exquisite relief, and was only the more inclined to
wonder at the composure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend's usual state of mind.

<p/>There was one circumstance in the history of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) grievances of
particular irritation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had good reason to believe that some
property of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) husband in the West Indies, which had been for many
years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own
incumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures; and this
property, though not large, would be enough to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) comparatively
rich. But there was nobody to stir in it. Mr Elliot would do nothing,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could do nothing herself, equally disabled from personal
exertion by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) state of bodily weakness, and from employing others by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) want of money. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had no natural connexions to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) even
with their counsel, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not afford to purchase the assistance
of the law. This was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means.
To feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ought to be in better circumstances, that a little
trouble in the right place might do it, and to fear that delay might be
even weakening her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) claims, was hard to bear.

<p/>It was on this point that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had hoped to engage Anne's good offices
with Mr Elliot. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had previously, in the anticipation of their
marriage, been very apprehensive of losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend by it; but on
being assured that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could have made no attempt of that nature, since
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did not even know her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to be in Bath, it immediately occurred, that
something might be done in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) favour by the influence of the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
loved, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been hastily preparing to interest Anne's feelings,
as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot's character would allow,
when Anne's refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of
everything; and while it took from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) the new-formed hope of
succeeding in the object of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) first anxiety, left her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) at least the
comfort of telling the whole story her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own way.

<p/>After listening to this full description of Mr Elliot, Anne could not
but express some surprise at Mrs Smith's having spoken of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) so
favourably in the beginning of their conversation. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Rooke</b></font>) had seemed to
recommend and praise him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>was Mrs Smith's reply, <div class="bookquote">``there was nothing else to be done.
I considered your marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) as certain, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) might not yet have
made the offer, and I could no more speak the truth of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
had been your husband. My heart bled for you, as I talked of
happiness; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is sensible, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is agreeable, and with such a
woman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was very unkind to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) first wife. They were wretched together. But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was too ignorant
and giddy for respect, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had never loved her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). I was willing to
hope that you must fare better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having
been induced to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) shudder at the idea of the
misery which must have followed. It was just possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) might
have been persuaded by Lady Russell! And under such a supposition,
which would have been most miserable, when time had disclosed all, too
late?

<p/>It was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived;
and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference,
which carried them through the greater part of the morning, was, that
Anne had full liberty to communicate to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend everything relative
to Mrs Smith, in which his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) conduct was involved.



<p/>Chapter 22


<p/>Anne went home to think over all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had heard. In one point, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot. There was no
longer anything of tenderness due to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) stood as opposed to
Captain Wentworth, in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) own unwelcome obtrusiveness; and the evil
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) attentions last night, the irremediable mischief he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) might have
done, was considered with sensations unqualified, unperplexed. Pity
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was all over. But this was the only point of relief. In every
other respect, in looking around her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), or penetrating forward, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw
more to distrust and to apprehend. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was concerned for the
disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling; for the
mortifications which must be hanging over her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) father and sister, and
had all the distress of foreseeing many evils, without knowing how to
avert any one of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was most thankful for her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) own knowledge of
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not
slighting an old friend like Mrs Smith, but here was a reward indeed
springing from it! Mrs Smith had been able to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) what no one
else could have done. Could the knowledge have been extended through
her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) family? But this was a vain idea. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) must talk to Lady Russell,
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>), consult with her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>), and having done her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) best, wait the event
with as much composure as possible; and after all, her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) greatest want of
composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be
opened to Lady Russell; in that flow of anxieties and fears which must
be all to herself.


<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) found, on reaching home, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) intended, escaped
seeing Mr Elliot; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had called and paid them a long morning
visit; but hardly had she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) congratulated herself, and felt safe, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was coming again in the evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had not the smallest intention of asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, with
affected carelessness, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) gave so many hints; so Mrs Clay says, at
least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, I do say it. I never saw anybody in my life spell harder for
an invitation. Poor man! I was really in pain for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); for your
hard-hearted sister, Miss Anne, seems bent on cruelty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``I have been rather too much used to the game to
be soon overcome by a gentleman's hints. However, when I found how
excessively he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was regretting that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) should miss my father this
morning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit an
opportunity of bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) and Sir Walter together. They appear to so
much advantage in company with each other. Each behaving so
pleasantly. Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite delightful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Clay</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Clay, not daring, however, to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>)
eyes towards Anne. <div class="bookquote">``Exactly like father and son! Dear Miss Elliot,
may I not say father and son?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I lay no embargo on any body's words. If you will have such
ideas! But, upon my word, I am scarcely sensible of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) attentions
being beyond those of other men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Miss Elliot!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Clay</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs Clay, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) hands and eyes,
and sinking all the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) astonishment in a convenient silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear Penelope, you need not be so alarmed about him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). I did
invite him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), you know. I sent him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) away with smiles. When I found he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
was really going to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day
to-morrow, I had compassion on him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew such
pleasure as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival of
the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
prime object. It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate the sight
of Mr Elliot; and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) could assume a most obliging, placid look,
and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting
herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) would have done
otherwise.

<p/>To Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the
room; and quite painful to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) approach and speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had
been used before to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) could not be always quite sincere, but
now she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw insincerity in everything. His (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) attentive deference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
father, contrasted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) former language, was odious; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could hardly bear
the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) present smiles and mildness, or the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
artificial good sentiments.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a
remonstrance on his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) side. It was a great object to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) to escape all
enquiry or eclat; but it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) intention to be as decidedly cool to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) as might be compatible with their relationship; and to retrace, as
quietly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had
been gradually led along. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was accordingly more guarded, and more
cool, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had been the night before.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) wanted to animate her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) curiosity again as to how and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) could
have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) formerly praised; wanted very much to be gratified by
more solicitation; but the charm was broken: he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) found that the heat and
animation of a public room was necessary to kindle his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) modest cousin's
vanity; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) found, at least, that it was not to be done now, by any of
those attempts which he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) could hazard among the too-commanding claims of
the others. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) little surmised that it was a subject acting now
exactly against his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) interest, bringing immediately to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) thoughts all
those parts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) conduct which were least excusable.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had some satisfaction in finding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was really going out of
Bath the next morning, going early, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) would be gone the
greater part of two days. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was invited again to Camden Place the
very evening of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) return; but from Thursday to Saturday evening his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
absence was certain. It was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be
always before her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>); but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their
party, seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort. It
was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) father and Elizabeth; to consider the various sources of
mortification preparing for them! Mrs Clay's selfishness was not so
complicate nor so revolting as his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); and Anne would have compounded for
the marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of Mr Elliot's
subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it.

<p/>On Friday morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) meant to go very early to Lady Russell, and
accomplish the necessary communication; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) would have gone
directly after breakfast, but that Mrs Clay was also going out on some
obliging purpose of saving her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) sister trouble, which determined her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) to
wait till she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) might be safe from such a companion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) saw Mrs Clay
fairly off, therefore, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) began to talk of spending the morning
in Rivers Street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``I have nothing to send but my love. Oh!
you may as well take back that tiresome book she (<font color='blue'><b>Penelope</b></font>) would lend me, and
pretend I have read it through. I really cannot be plaguing myself for
ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out.
Lady Russell quite bores one with her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) new publications. You need not
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) so, but I thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) dress hideous the other night. I used
to think she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had some taste in dress, but I was ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) at the
concert. Something so formal and _arrangé_ in her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) air! and she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) sits so
upright! My best love, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div>added Sir Walter. <div class="bookquote">``Kindest regards. And you may say, that
I mean to call upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) soon. Make a civil message; but I shall only
leave my card. Morning visits are never fair by women at her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) time of
life, who make themselves up so little. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) would only wear rouge
she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) would not be afraid of being seen; but last time I called, I
observed the blinds were let down immediately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>While her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father spoke, there was a knock at the door. Who could it
be? Anne, remembering the preconcerted visits, at all hours, of Mr
Elliot, would have expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), but for his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) known engagement seven
miles off. After the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds of
approach were heard, and <div class="bookquote">``Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were ushered
into the room.

<p/>Surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance; but Anne
was really glad to see them; and the others were not so sorry but that
they could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon as it became
clear that these, their nearest relations, were not arrived with any
views of accommodation in that house, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were
able to rise in cordiality, and do the honours of it very well. They
were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove, and were at the
White Hart. So much was pretty soon understood; but till Sir Walter
and Elizabeth were walking Mary into the other drawing-room, and
regaling themselves with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) admiration, Anne could not draw upon
Charles's brain for a regular history of their coming, or an
explanation of some smiling hints of particular business, which had
been ostentatiously dropped by Mary, as well as of some apparent
confusion as to whom their party consisted of.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove, Henrietta, and
Captain Harville, beside their two selves. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) a very plain,
intelligible account of the whole; a narration in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) saw a great
deal of most characteristic proceeding. The scheme had received its
first impulse by Captain Harville's wanting to come to Bath on
business. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had begun to talk of it a week ago; and by way of doing
something, as shooting was over, Charles had proposed coming with him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>),
and Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it very much, as an
advantage to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) husband; but Mary could not bear to be left, and had
made herself so unhappy about it, that for a day or two everything
seemed to be in suspense, or at an end. But then, it had been taken up
by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) father and mother. His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother had some old friends in Bath whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wanted to see; it was thought a good opportunity for Henrietta to
come and buy wedding-clothes for herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) sister; and, in short,
it ended in being his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother's party, that everything might be
comfortable and easy to Captain Harville; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) and Mary were included
in it by way of general convenience. They had arrived late the night
before. Mrs Harville, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) children, and Captain Benwick, remained with
Mr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross.

<p/>Anne's only surprise was, that affairs should be in forwardness enough
for Henrietta's wedding-clothes to be talked of. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) had imagined such
difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage
from being near at hand; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) learned from Charles that, very
recently, -LRB-since Mary's last letter to herself-RRB-, Charles Hayter had
been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not
possibly claim it under many years; and that on the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>)
present income, with almost a certainty of something more permanent
long before the term in question, the two families had consented to the
young people's wishes, and that their marriage was likely to take place
in a few months, quite as soon as Louisa's. <div class="bookquote">``And a very good living it
was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>Charles added: <div class="bookquote">``only five-and-twenty miles from Uppercross, and
in a very fine country: fine part of Dorsetshire. In the centre of
some of the best preserves in the kingdom, surrounded by three great
proprietors, each more careful and jealous than the other; and to two
of the three at least, Charles Hayter might get a special
recommendation. Not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) will value it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) ought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) observed,
<div class="bookquote">``Charles is too cool about sporting. That's the worst of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am extremely glad, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>cried Anne, <div class="bookquote">``particularly glad that this
should happen; and that of two sisters, who both deserve equally well,
and who have always been such good friends, the pleasant prospect of
one should not be dimming those of the other--that they should be so
equal in their prosperity and comfort. I hope your father and mother
are quite happy with regard to both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes. My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were
richer, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has no other fault to find. Money, you know, coming
down with money--two daughters at once--it cannot be a very agreeable
operation, and it streightens him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as to many things. However, I do not
mean to say they have not a right to it. It is very fit they should
have daughters' shares; and I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has always been a very kind,
liberal father to me. Mary does not above half like Henrietta's match.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) never did, you know. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) does not do him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) justice, nor think
enough about Winthrop. I cannot make her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) attend to the value of the
property. It is a very fair match, as times go; and I have liked
Charles Hayter all my life, and I shall not leave off now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Anne,
<div class="bookquote">``should be happy in their children's marriages. They do everything to
confer happiness, I am sure. What a blessing to young people to be in
such hands! Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those
ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery,
both in young and old. I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered
now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) answered rather hesitatingly, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I believe I do; very much
recovered; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) is altered; there is no running or jumping about, no
laughing or dancing; it is quite different. If one happens only to
shut the door a little hard, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) starts and wriggles like a young
dab-chick in the water; and Benwick sits at her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) elbow, reading verses,
or whispering to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>), all day long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne could not help laughing. <div class="bookquote">``That cannot be much to your taste, I
know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but I do believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) to be an excellent young man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) is. Nobody doubts it; and I hope you do not think I am
so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and
pleasures as myself. I have a great value for Benwick; and when one
can but get him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to talk, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has plenty to say. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reading has done
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no harm, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has fought as well as read. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a brave fellow.
I got more acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last Monday than ever I did before. We
had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in my father's great
barns; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) played his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) part so well that I have liked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) the better
ever since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div><p/>Here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles's
following the others to admire mirrors and china; but Anne had heard
enough to understand the present state of Uppercross, and rejoice in
its happiness; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sighed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) rejoiced, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sigh had none
of the ill-will of envy in it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would certainly have risen to their
blessings if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not want to lessen theirs.

<p/>The visit passed off altogether in high good humour. Mary was in
excellent spirits, enjoying the gaiety and the change, and so well
satisfied with the journey in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mother-in-law's carriage with four
horses, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own complete independence of Camden Place, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ought, and
enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house, as they
were detailed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had no demands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father or sister, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) consequence was just enough increased by their handsome
drawing-rooms.

<p/>Elizabeth was, for a short time, suffering a good deal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt that
Mrs Musgrove and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) party ought to be asked to dine with them; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) could not bear to have the difference of style, the reduction of
servants, which a dinner must betray, witnessed by those who had been
always so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch. It was a struggle
between propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better, and then
Elizabeth was happy again. These were her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) internal persuasions: <div class="bookquote">``Old
fashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess to give
dinners; few people in Bath do; Lady Alicia never does; did not even
ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) own sister's family, though they were here a month: and I dare
say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove; put her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) quite out of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) way. I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) would rather not come; she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) cannot feel easy
with us. I will ask them all for an evening; that will be much better;
that will be a novelty and a treat. They have not seen two such
drawing rooms before. They will be delighted to come to-morrow
evening. It shall be a regular party, small, but most elegant.''  (<font color='red'><b>These persuasions</b></font>)</div>And
this satisfied Elizabeth: and when the invitation was given to the two
present, and promised for the absent, Mary was as completely satisfied.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was particularly asked to meet Mr Elliot, and be introduced to Lady
Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, who were fortunately already engaged to
come; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carteret</b></font>) could not have received a more gratifying attention.
Miss Elliot was to have the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the
course of the morning; and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary, to go
and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and Henrietta directly.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present.
They all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes; but
Anne convinced herself that a day's delay of the intended communication
could be of no consequence, and hastened forward to the White Hart, to
see again the friends and companions of the last autumn, with an
eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form.

<p/>They found Mrs Musgrove and her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) daughter within, and by themselves, and
Anne had the kindest welcome from each. Henrietta was exactly in that
state of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness, which made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) full of regard and interest for everybody she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) had ever liked before
at all; and Mrs Musgrove's real affection had been won by her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)
usefulness when they were in distress. It was a heartiness, and a
warmth, and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more, from the sad
want of such blessings at home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was entreated to give them as much
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) time as possible, invited for every day and all day long, or
rather claimed as part of the family; and, in return, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) naturally
fell into all her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wonted ways of attention and assistance, and on
Charles's leaving them together, was listening to Mrs Musgrove's
history of Louisa, and to Henrietta's of herself, giving opinions on
business, and recommendations to shops; with intervals of every help
which Mary required, from altering her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ribbon to settling her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) accounts;
from finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) keys, and assorting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) trinkets, to trying to
convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not ill-used by anybody; which Mary, well
amused as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) generally was, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) station at a window overlooking the
entrance to the Pump Room, could not but have her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) moments of imagining.

<p/>A morning of thorough confusion was to be expected. A large party in
an hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene. One five minutes
brought a note, the next a parcel; and Anne had not been there half an
hour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was, seemed more than half
filled: a party of steady old friends were seated around Mrs Musgrove,
and Charles came back with Captains Harville and Wentworth. The
appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the
moment. It was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to have forgotten to feel that this
arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together
again. Their last meeting had been most important in opening his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)
feelings; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had derived from it a delightful conviction; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
feared from his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which had
hastened him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) away from the Concert Room, still governed. He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) did not
seem to want to be near enough for conversation.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course, and tried
to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:--<div class="bookquote">``Surely, if
there be constant attachment on each side, our hearts must understand
each other ere long. We are not boy and girl, to be captiously
irritable, misled by every moment's inadvertence, and wantonly playing
with our own happiness.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>And yet, a few minutes afterwards, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) felt
as if their being in company with each other, under their present
circumstances, could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and
misconstructions of the most mischievous kind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>cried Mary, still at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) window, <div class="bookquote">``there is Mrs Clay, I am sure,
standing under the colonnade, and a gentleman with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>). I saw them
turn the corner from Bath Street just now. They seemed deep in talk.
Who is it? Come, and tell me. Good heavens! I recollect. It is Mr
Elliot himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>cried Anne, quickly, <div class="bookquote">``it cannot be Mr Elliot, I assure you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
was to leave Bath at nine this morning, and does not come back till
to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) spoke, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), the
consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) regret
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had said so much, simple as it was.

<p/>Mary, resenting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should be supposed not to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own cousin,
began talking very warmly about the family features, and protesting
still more positively that it was Mr Elliot, calling again upon Anne to
come and look for herself, but Anne did not mean to stir, and tried to
be cool and unconcerned. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) distress returned, however, on perceiving
smiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the lady
visitors, as if they believed themselves quite in the secret. It was
evident that the report concerning her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had spread, and a short pause
succeeded, which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do come, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>cried Mary, <div class="bookquote">``come and look yourself. You will be too
late if you do not make haste. They are parting; they are shaking
hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is turning away. Not know Mr Elliot, indeed! You seem to
have forgot all about Lyme.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div><p/>To pacify Mary, and perhaps screen her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own embarrassment, Anne did move
quietly to the window. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was just in time to ascertain that it
really was Mr Elliot, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had never believed, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
disappeared on one side, as Mrs Clay walked quickly off on the other;
and checking the surprise which she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) could not but feel at such an
appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally
opposite interest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) calmly said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is Mr Elliot, certainly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) has changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) hour of going, I suppose, that is all, or I may be
mistaken, I might not attend;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and walked back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) chair,
recomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself
well.

<p/>The visitors took their leave; and Charles, having civilly seen them
off, and then made a face at them, and abused them for coming, began
with--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, mother, I have done something for you that you will like. I
have been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night. A'n't
I a good boy? I know you love a play; and there is room for us all.
It holds nine. I have engaged Captain Wentworth. Anne will not be
sorry to join us, I am sure. We all like a play. Have not I done
well, mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) perfect
readiness for the play, if Henrietta and all the others liked it, when
Mary eagerly interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) by exclaiming--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens, Charles! how can you think of such a thing? Take a box
for to-morrow night! Have you forgot that we are engaged to Camden
Place to-morrow night? and that we were most particularly asked to meet
Lady Dalrymple and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) daughter, and Mr Elliot, and all the principal
family connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them? How can you be
so forgetful?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Phoo! phoo!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>replied Charles, <div class="bookquote">``what's an evening party? Never worth
remembering. Your father might have asked us to dinner, I think, if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
had wanted to see us. You may do as you like, but I shall go to the
play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Charles, I declare it will be too abominable if you do, when you
promised to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No, I did not promise. I only smirked and bowed, and said the word
``happy.<div class="bookquote">'' There was no promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must go, Charles. It would be unpardonable to fail. We were
asked on purpose to be introduced. There was always such a great
connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves. Nothing ever happened
on either side that was not announced immediately. We are quite near
relations, you know; and Mr Elliot too, whom you ought so particularly
to be acquainted with! Every attention is due to Mr Elliot. Consider,
my father's heir: the future representative of the family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk to me about heirs and representatives,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>cried Charles. <div class="bookquote">``I
am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising
sun. If I would not go for the sake of your father, I should think it
scandalous to go for the sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heir. What is Mr Elliot to me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>The careless expression was life to Anne, who saw that Captain
Wentworth was all attention, looking and listening with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) whole soul;
and that the last words brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) enquiring eyes from Charles to
herself.

<p/>Charles and Mary still talked on in the same style; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), half serious
and half jesting, maintaining the scheme for the play, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>),
invariably serious, most warmly opposing it, and not omitting to make
it known that, however determined to go to Camden Place herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
should not think herself very well used, if they went to the play
without her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). Mrs Musgrove interposed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We had better put it off. Charles, you had much better go back and
change the box for Tuesday. It would be a pity to be divided, and we
should be losing Miss Anne, too, if there is a party at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father's;
and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play,
if Miss Anne could not be with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne felt truly obliged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) for such kindness; and quite as much so
for the opportunity it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) of decidedly saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it depended only on my inclination, ma'am, the party at home
-LRB-excepting on Mary's account-RRB- would not be the smallest impediment. I
have no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy to
change it for a play, and with you. But, it had better not be
attempted, perhaps.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had spoken it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) trembled when it was
done, conscious that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) words were listened to, and daring not even to
try to observe their effect.

<p/>It was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day; Charles
only reserving the advantage of still teasing his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wife, by persisting
that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would.

<p/>Captain Wentworth left his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) seat, and walked to the fire-place; probably
for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards, and taking a
station, with less bare-faced design, by Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not been long enough in Bath,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``to enjoy the evening
parties of the place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no. The usual character of them has nothing for me. I am no
card-player.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were not formerly, I know. You did not use to like cards; but
time makes many changes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not yet so much changed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>cried Anne, and stopped, fearing she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
hardly knew what misconstruction. After waiting a few moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said,
and as if it were the result of immediate feeling, <div class="bookquote">``It is a period,
indeed! Eight years and a half is a period.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) would have proceeded farther was left to Anne's imagination
to ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
had uttered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was startled to other subjects by Henrietta, eager to
make use of the present leisure for getting out, and calling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)
companions to lose no time, lest somebody else should come in.

<p/>They were obliged to move. Anne talked of being perfectly ready, and
tried to look it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt that could Henrietta have known the
regret and reluctance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) heart in quitting that chair, in preparing
to quit the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) would have found, in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) own sensations for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) cousin, in the very security of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) affection, wherewith to pity
her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>).

<p/>Their preparations, however, were stopped short. Alarming sounds were
heard; other visitors approached, and the door was thrown open for Sir
Walter and Miss Elliot, whose entrance seemed to give a general chill.
Anne felt an instant oppression, and wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) looked saw symptoms
of the same. The comfort, the freedom, the gaiety of the room was
over, hushed into cold composure, determined silence, or insipid talk,
to meet the heartless elegance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father and sister. How
mortifying to feel that it was so!

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) jealous eye was satisfied in one particular. Captain Wentworth was
acknowledged again by each, by Elizabeth more graciously than before.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) even addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) once, and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) more than once.
Elizabeth was, in fact, revolving a great measure. The sequel
explained it. After the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper
nothings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) began to give the invitation which was to comprise all
the remaining dues of the Musgroves. <div class="bookquote">``To-morrow evening, to meet a few
friends: no formal party.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was all said very gracefully, and the
cards with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had provided herself, the <div class="bookquote">``Miss Elliot at home,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>were laid on the table, with a courteous, comprehensive smile to all,
and one smile and one card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth. The
truth was, that Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand
the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The past
was nothing. The present was that Captain Wentworth would move about
well in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) drawing-room. The card was pointedly given, and Sir Walter
and Elizabeth arose and disappeared.

<p/>The interruption had been short, though severe, and ease and animation
returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out, but not
to Anne. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could think only of the invitation she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had with such
astonishment witnessed, and of the manner in which it had been
received; a manner of doubtful meaning, of surprise rather than
gratification, of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw disdain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) eye, and could not venture to believe
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had determined to accept such an offering, as an atonement for
all the insolence of the past. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) spirits sank. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) held the card in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) hand after they were gone, as if deeply considering it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only think of Elizabeth's including everybody!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>whispered Mary very
audibly. <div class="bookquote">``I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted! You see he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
cannot put the card out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) eye, saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) cheeks glow, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) mouth form itself
into a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
might neither see nor hear more to vex her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/>The party separated. The gentlemen had their own pursuits, the ladies
proceeded on their own business, and they met no more while Anne
belonged to them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was earnestly begged to return and dine, and
give them all the rest of the day, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) spirits had been so long
exerted that at present she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt unequal to more, and fit only for
home, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) might be sure of being as silent as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) chose.

<p/>Promising to be with them the whole of the following morning,
therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to
Camden Place, there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the
busy arrangements of Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow's party, the
frequent enumeration of the persons invited, and the continually
improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the
most completely elegant of its kind in Bath, while harassing herself
with the never-ending question, of whether Captain Wentworth would come
or not? They were reckoning him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) as certain, but with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) it was a
gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
generally thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) would come, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) generally thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
ought; but it was a case which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not so shape into any positive
act of duty or discretion, as inevitably to defy the suggestions of
very opposite feelings.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation,
to let Mrs Clay know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) had been seen with Mr Elliot three hours
after his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) being supposed to be out of Bath, for having watched in vain
for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
determined to mention it, and it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) there was guilt in Mrs
Clay's face as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) listened. It was transient: cleared away in an
instant; but Anne could imagine she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) read there the consciousness of
having, by some complication of mutual trick, or some overbearing
authority of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), been obliged to attend -LRB-perhaps for half an hour-RRB- to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) lectures and restrictions on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) designs on Sir Walter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
exclaimed, however, with a very tolerable imitation of nature:--

<p/>``Oh! dear! very true. Only think, Miss Elliot, to my great surprise I
met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street. I was never more astonished. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had been prevented
setting off for Thornberry, but I really forget by what; for I was in a
hurry, and could not much attend, and I can only answer for his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) being
determined not to be delayed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) return. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) wanted to know how
early he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) might be admitted to-morrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was full of ``to-morrow,<div class="bookquote">'' and
it is very evident that I have been full of it too, ever since I
entered the house, and learnt the extension of your plan and all that
had happened, or my seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) could never have gone so entirely out of
my head.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 23


<p/>One day only had passed since Anne's conversation with Mrs Smith; but a
keener interest had succeeded, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was now so little touched by Mr
Elliot's conduct, except by its effects in one quarter, that it became
a matter of course the next morning, still to defer her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) explanatory
visit in Rivers Street. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had promised to be with the Musgroves from
breakfast to dinner. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) faith was plighted, and Mr Elliot's
character, like the Sultaness Scheherazade's head, must live another
day.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could not keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) appointment punctually, however; the weather was
unfavourable, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had grieved over the rain on her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) friends'
account, and felt it very much on her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) own, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was able to
attempt the walk. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) reached the White Hart, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) way to
the proper apartment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) found herself neither arriving quite in time,
nor the first to arrive. The party before her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) were, Mrs Musgrove,
talking to Mrs Croft, and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) immediately heard that Mary and Henrietta, too impatient to wait,
had gone out the moment it had cleared, but would be back again soon,
and that the strictest injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to
keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) there till they returned. She (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had only to submit, sit down,
be outwardly composed, and feel herself plunged at once in all the
agitations which she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had merely laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) account of tasting a little
before the morning closed. There was no delay, no waste of time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)
was deep in the happiness of such misery, or the misery of such
happiness, instantly. Two minutes after her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) entering the room, Captain
Wentworth said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will write the letter we were talking of, Harville, now, if you
will give me materials.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wentworth/Mr Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Materials were at hand, on a separate table; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) went to it, and nearly
turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) back to them all, was engrossed by writing.

<p/>Mrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) eldest daughter's
engagement, and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was
perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper. Anne felt that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not belong to the conversation, and yet, as Captain Harville
seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) could not avoid hearing
many undesirable particulars; such as, <div class="bookquote">``how Mr Musgrove and my brother
Hayter had met again and again to talk it over; what my brother Hayter
had said one day, and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next, and what
had occurred to my sister Hayter, and what the young people had wished,
and what I said at first I never could consent to, but was afterwards
persuaded to think might do very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and a great deal in the same
style of open-hearted communication: minutiae which, even with every
advantage of taste and delicacy, which good Mrs Musgrove could not
give, could be properly interesting only to the principals. Mrs Croft
was attending with great good-humour, and whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) spoke at all, it
was very sensibly. Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too much
self-occupied to hear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so, ma'am, all these thing considered,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Musgrove, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)
powerful whisper, <div class="bookquote">``though we could have wished it different, yet,
altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer, for
Charles Hayter was quite wild about it, and Henrietta was pretty near
as bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once, and make the
best of it, as many others have done before them. At any rate, said I,
it will be better than a long engagement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is precisely what I was going to observe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Croft/Croft</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Croft. <div class="bookquote">``I
would rather have young people settle on a small income at once, and
have to struggle with a few difficulties together, than be involved in
a long engagement. I always think that no mutual--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! dear Mrs Croft,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Musgrove, unable to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) finish her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)
speech, <div class="bookquote">``there is nothing I so abominate for young people as a long
engagement. It is what I always protested against for my children. It
is all very well, I used to say, for young people to be engaged, if
there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months, or
even in twelve; but a long engagement--''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Croft/Croft</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Croft, <div class="bookquote">``or an uncertain engagement, an
engagement which may be long. To begin without knowing that at such a
time there will be the means of marrying, I hold to be very unsafe and
unwise, and what I think all parents should prevent as far as they can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Croft/Croft</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne found an unexpected interest here. She (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) felt its application to
herself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>); and at the same
moment that her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table,
Captain Wentworth's pen ceased to move, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) head was raised, pausing,
listening, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) turned round the next instant to give a look, one
quick, conscious look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>).

<p/>The two ladies continued to talk, to re-urge the same admitted truths,
and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary
practice as had fallen within their observation, but Anne heard nothing
distinctly; it was only a buzz of words in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ear, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mind was in
confusion.

<p/>Captain Harville, who had in truth been hearing none of it, now left
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) seat, and moved to a window, and Anne seeming to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), though
it was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
was inviting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) stood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) with a
smile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed, <div class="bookquote">``Come to me, I
have something to say;''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and the unaffected, easy kindness of manner
which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) really was,
strongly enforced the invitation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) roused herself and went to him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>).
The window at which he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) stood was at the other end of the room from
where the two ladies were sitting, and though nearer to Captain
Wentworth's table, not very near. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) joined him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), Captain
Harville's countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful expression
which seemed its natural character.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), unfolding a parcel in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) hand, and displaying a
small miniature painting, <div class="bookquote">``do you know who that is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly: Captain Benwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and you may guess who it is for. But,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-in a deep tone,-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``it was
not done for her (<font color='blue'><b>parents</b></font>). Miss Elliot, do you remember our walking together at
Lyme, and grieving for him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)? I little thought then--but no matter.
This was drawn at the Cape. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) met with a clever young German artist
at the Cape, and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister, sat to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), and was bringing it home for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>); and I have now the charge of
getting it properly set for another! It was a commission to me! But
who else was there to employ? I hope I can allow for him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). I am not
sorry, indeed, to make it over to another. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) undertakes it;''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>-LRB-looking
towards Captain Wentworth,-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) is writing about it now.''  (<font color='red'><b>Wentworth/Mr Wentworth</b></font>)</div>And with a
quivering lip he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) wound up the whole by adding, <div class="bookquote">``Poor Fanny! she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would
not have forgotten him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) so soon!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>replied Anne, in a low, feeling voice. <div class="bookquote">``That I can easily
believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) nature. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) doted on him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>Captain Harville smiled, as much as to say, <div class="bookquote">``Do you claim that for your
sex?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harville/Mrs Harville</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) answered the question, smiling also, <div class="bookquote">``Yes. We certainly
do not forget you as soon as you forget us. It is, perhaps, our fate
rather than our merit. We cannot help ourselves. We live at home,
quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us. You are forced on
exertion. You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some
sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and
continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men
-LRB-which, however, I do not think I shall grant-RRB-, it does not apply to
Benwick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) has not been forced upon any exertion. The peace turned
him (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) on shore at the very moment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>) has been living with us, in our
little family circle, ever since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Anne, <div class="bookquote">``very true; I did not recollect; but what shall we
say now, Captain Harville? If the change be not from outward
circumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature, man's nature,
which has done the business for Captain Benwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, it is not man's nature. I will not allow it to be more man's
nature than woman's to be inconstant and forget those they do love, or
have loved. I believe the reverse. I believe in a true analogy
between our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies are
the strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough
usage, and riding out the heaviest weather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your feelings may be the strongest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>replied Anne, <div class="bookquote">``but the same
spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most
tender. Man is more robust than woman, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) is not longer lived;
which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments.
Nay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise. You have
difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with. You
are always labouring and toiling, exposed to every risk and hardship.
Your home, country, friends, all quitted. Neither time, nor health,
nor life, to be called your own. It would be hard, indeed''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>-LRB-with a
faltering voice-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``if woman's feelings were to be added to all this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall never agree upon this question,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>Captain Harville was
beginning to say, when a slight noise called their attention to Captain
Wentworth's hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room. It was
nothing more than that his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) pen had fallen down; but Anne was startled
at finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) nearer than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had supposed, and half inclined to
suspect that the pen had only fallen because he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had been occupied by
them, striving to catch sounds, which yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) could
have caught.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you finished your letter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain Harville.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not quite, a few lines more. I shall have done in five minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no hurry on my side. I am only ready whenever you are. I am
in very good anchorage here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>-LRB-smiling at Anne,-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``well supplied, and
want for nothing. No hurry for a signal at all. Well, Miss Elliot,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>-LRB-lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) voice,-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``as I was saying we shall never agree, I suppose,
upon this point. No man and woman, would, probably. But let me
observe that all histories are against you--all stories, prose and
verse. If I had such a memory as Benwick, I could bring you fifty
quotations in a moment on my side the argument, and I do not think I
ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon
woman's inconstancy. Songs and proverbs, all talk of woman's
fickleness. But perhaps you will say, these were all written by men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I shall. Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples in
books. Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story.
Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been
in their hands. I will not allow books to prove anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how shall we prove anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We never shall. We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a
point. It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof.
We each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex; and
upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has
occurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances -LRB-perhaps
those very cases which strike us the most-RRB- may be precisely such as
cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence, or in some
respect saying what should not be said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>cried Captain Harville, in a tone of strong feeling, ``if I could
but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) takes a last look at
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife and children, and watches the boat that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has sent them off
in, as long as it is in sight, and then turns away and says, ``God knows
whether we ever meet again!'' And then, if I could convey to you the
glow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) soul when he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) does see them again; when, coming back after a
twelvemonth's absence, perhaps, and obliged to put into another port,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) calculates how soon it be possible to get them there, pretending to
deceive himself, and saying, ``They cannot be here till such a day,<div class="bookquote">'' but
all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them
arrive at last, as if Heaven had given them wings, by many hours sooner
still! If I could explain to you all this, and all that a man can bear
and do, and glories to do, for the sake of these treasures of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
existence! I speak, you know, only of such men as have hearts!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own with emotion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>cried Anne eagerly, <div class="bookquote">``I hope I do justice to all that is felt by
you, and by those who resemble you. God forbid that I should
undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my
fellow-creatures! I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to
suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman.
No, I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married
lives. I believe you equal to every important exertion, and to every
domestic forbearance, so long as--if I may be allowed the
expression--so long as you have an object. I mean while the woman you
love lives, and lives for you. All the privilege I claim for my own
sex -LRB-it is not a very enviable one; you need not covet it-RRB-, is that of
loving longest, when existence or when hope is gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heart was
too full, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) breath too much oppressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a good soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>cried Captain Harville, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>)
arm, quite affectionately. <div class="bookquote">``There is no quarrelling with you. And
when I think of Benwick, my tongue is tied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div><p/>Their attention was called towards the others. Mrs Croft was taking
leave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, Frederick, you and I part company, I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am
going home, and you have an engagement with your friend. To-night we
may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>-LRB-turning to
Anne.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``We had your sister's card yesterday, and I understood
Frederick had a card too, though I did not see it; and you are
disengaged, Frederick, are you not, as well as ourselves?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>Captain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste, and either
could not or would not answer fully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``very true; here we separate, but Harville and I shall
soon be after you; that is, Harville, if you are ready, I am in half a
minute. I know you will not be sorry to be off. I shall be at your
service in half a minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs Croft left them, and Captain Wentworth, having sealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) letter
with great rapidity, was indeed ready, and had even a hurried, agitated
air, which shewed impatience to be gone. Anne knew not how to
understand it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had the kindest <div class="bookquote">``Good morning, God bless you!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>from
Captain Harville, but from him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) not a word, nor a look! He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had passed
out of the room without a look!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) had only time, however, to move closer to the table where he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had
been writing, when footsteps were heard returning; the door opened, it
was himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) begged their pardon, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) gloves,
and instantly crossing the room to the writing table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) drew out a
letter from under the scattered paper, placed it before Anne with eyes
of glowing entreaty fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) for a time, and hastily collecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
gloves, was again out of the room, almost before Mrs Musgrove was aware
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) being in it: the work of an instant!

<p/>The revolution which one instant had made in Anne, was almost beyond
expression. The letter, with a direction hardly legible, to <div class="bookquote">``Miss A.
E.--,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was evidently the one which he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had been folding so hastily.
While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had been also
addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)! On the contents of that letter depended all which this
world could do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Anything was possible, anything might be
defied rather than suspense. Mrs Musgrove had little arrangements of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) own at her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) own table; to their protection she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) must trust, and
sinking into the chair which he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had occupied, succeeding to the very
spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had leaned and written, her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) eyes devoured the following
words:


<p/>``I can listen no longer in silence. I must speak to you by such means
as are within my reach. You pierce my soul. I am half agony, half
hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are
gone for ever. I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your
own than when you almost broke it, eight years and a half ago. Dare
not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love has an
earlier death. I have loved none but you. Unjust I may have been,
weak and resentful I have been, but never inconstant. You alone have
brought me to Bath. For you alone, I think and plan. Have you not
seen this? Can you fail to have understood my wishes? I had not
waited even these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think
you must have penetrated mine. I can hardly write. I am every instant
hearing something which overpowers me. You sink your voice, but I can
distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others.
Too good, too excellent creature! You do us justice, indeed. You do
believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men. Believe
it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in F. W.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I shall return hither, or follow
your party, as soon as possible. A word, a look, will be enough to
decide whether I enter your father's house this evening or never.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Such a letter was not to be soon recovered from. Half an hour's
solitude and reflection might have tranquillized her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>); but the ten
minutes only which now passed before she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) was interrupted, with all the
restraints of her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) situation, could do nothing towards tranquillity.
Every moment rather brought fresh agitation. It was overpowering
happiness. And before she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) was beyond the first stage of full
sensation, Charles, Mary, and Henrietta all came in.

<p/>The absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an
immediate struggle; but after a while she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) could do no more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) began
not to understand a word they said, and was obliged to plead
indisposition and excuse herself. They could then see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) looked
very ill, were shocked and concerned, and would not stir without her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)
for the world. This was dreadful. Would they only have gone away, and
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) in the quiet possession of that room it would have been her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)
cure; but to have them all standing or waiting around her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) was
distracting, and in desperation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) would go home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By all means, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Musgrove, <div class="bookquote">``go home directly, and
take care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening. I wish
Sarah was here to doctor you, but I am no doctor myself. Charles, ring
and order a chair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) must not walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div><p/>But the chair would never do. Worse than all! To lose the possibility
of speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) quiet,
solitary progress up the town -LRB-and she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) felt almost certain of meeting
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)-RRB- could not be borne. The chair was earnestly protested against,
and Mrs Musgrove, who thought only of one sort of illness, having
assured herself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall in the
case; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down, and got a blow
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was perfectly convinced of having had no fall;
could part with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) cheerfully, and depend on finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) better at
night.

<p/>Anxious to omit no possible precaution, Anne struggled, and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid, ma'am, that it is not perfectly understood. Pray be so
good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your
whole party this evening. I am afraid there had been some mistake; and
I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain
Wentworth, that we hope to see them both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! my dear, it is quite understood, I give you my word. Captain
Harville has no thought but of going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think so? But I am afraid; and I should be so very sorry.
Will you promise me to mention it, when you see them again? You will
see them both this morning, I dare say. Do promise me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure I will, if you wish it. Charles, if you see Captain
Harville anywhere, remember to give Miss Anne's message. But indeed,
my dear, you need not be uneasy. Captain Harville holds himself quite
engaged, I'll answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, I dare
say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne could do no more; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heart prophesied some mischance to damp
the perfection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felicity. It could not be very lasting, however.
Even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not come to Camden Place himself, it would be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
power to send an intelligible sentence by Captain Harville. Another
momentary vexation occurred. Charles, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) real concern and good
nature, would go home with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); there was no preventing him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). This was
almost cruel. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could not be long ungrateful; he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was sacrificing
an engagement at a gunsmith's, to be of use to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) set off
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), with no feeling but gratitude apparent.

<p/>They were on Union Street, when a quicker step behind, a something of
familiar sound, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) two moments' preparation for the sight of
Captain Wentworth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) joined them; but, as if irresolute whether to
join or to pass on, said nothing, only looked. Anne could command
herself enough to receive that look, and not repulsively. The cheeks
which had been pale now glowed, and the movements which had hesitated
were decided. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) walked by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) side. Presently, struck by a sudden
thought, Charles said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain Wentworth, which way are you going? Only to Gay Street, or
farther up the town?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Mrs Musgrove/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hardly know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>replied Captain Wentworth, surprised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going as high as Belmont? Are you going near Camden Place?
Because, if you are, I shall have no scruple in asking you to take my
place, and give Anne your arm to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father's door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) is rather done
for this morning, and must not go so far without help, and I ought to
be at that fellow's in the Market Place. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) promised me the sight of a
capital gun he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is just going to send off; said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would keep it
unpacked to the last possible moment, that I might see it; and if I do
not turn back now, I have no chance. By his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) description, a good deal
like the second size double-barrel of mine, which you shot with one day
round Winthrop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There could not be an objection. There could be only the most proper
alacrity, a most obliging compliance for public view; and smiles reined
in and spirits dancing in private rapture. In half a minute Charles
was at the bottom of Union Street again, and the other two proceeding
together: and soon words enough had passed between them to decide
their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel
walk, where the power of conversation would make the present hour a
blessing indeed, and prepare it for all the immortality which the
happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow. There
they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once
before seemed to secure everything, but which had been followed by so
many, many years of division and estrangement. There they returned
again into the past, more exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their
re-union, than when it had been first projected; more tender, more
tried, more fixed in a knowledge of each other's character, truth, and
attachment; more equal to act, more justified in acting. And there, as
they slowly paced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group around
them, seeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers,
flirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge in
those retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in those
explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment, which
were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest. All the little
variations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday and
today there could scarcely be an end.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had not mistaken him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>). Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been the retarding
weight, the doubt, the torment. That had begun to operate in the very
hour of first meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) in Bath; that had returned, after a short
suspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) in
everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had said and done, or omitted to say and do, in the last
four-and-twenty hours. It had been gradually yielding to the better
hopes which her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) looks, or words, or actions occasionally encouraged; it
had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which
had reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) talked with Captain Harville; and under the
irresistible governance of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had seized a sheet of paper, and
poured out his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) feelings.

<p/>Of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) persisted in having loved none but her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had never been
supplanted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) never even believed himself to see her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) equal. Thus
much indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was obliged to acknowledge: that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had been constant
unconsciously, nay unintentionally; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had meant to forget her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>),
and believed it to be done. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had imagined himself indifferent, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had only been angry; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had been unjust to her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) merits, because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had been a sufferer from them. Her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) character was now fixed on his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
mind as perfection itself, maintaining the loveliest medium of
fortitude and gentleness; but he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was obliged to acknowledge that only
at Uppercross had he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) learnt to do her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) justice, and only at Lyme had he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
begun to understand himself. At Lyme, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had received lessons of more
than one sort. The passing admiration of Mr Elliot had at least roused
him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), and the scenes on the Cobb and at Captain Harville's had fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>)
superiority.

<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove -LRB-the
attempts of angry pride-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) protested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had for ever felt it to
be impossible; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had not cared, could not care, for Louisa;
though till that day, till the leisure for reflection which followed
it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which
Louisa's could so ill bear a comparison, or the perfect unrivalled hold
it possessed over his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) own. There, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had learnt to distinguish between
the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self-will, between the
darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind. There
he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had seen everything to exalt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) estimation the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had
lost; and there begun to deplore the pride, the folly, the madness of
resentment, which had kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) from trying to regain her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) when thrown in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) way.

<p/>From that period his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) penance had become severe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had no sooner been
free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of
Louisa's accident, no sooner begun to feel himself alive again, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
had begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I found,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that I was considered by Harville an engaged man!
That neither Harville nor his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife entertained a doubt of our mutual
attachment. I was startled and shocked. To a degree, I could
contradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect that others
might have felt the same--her (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) own family, nay, perhaps herself--I was
no longer at my own disposal. I was hers in honour if she (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) wished it.
I had been unguarded. I had not thought seriously on this subject
before. I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its
danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that I had no right to be
trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls, at the
risk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other ill
effects. I had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) found too late, in short, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had entangled himself; and that
precisely as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) became fully satisfied of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) not caring for Louisa at
all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) must regard himself as bound to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>), if her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) sentiments for him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
were what the Harvilles supposed. It determined him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) to leave Lyme, and
await her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) complete recovery elsewhere. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) would gladly weaken, by any
fair means, whatever feelings or speculations concerning him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) might
exist; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) went, therefore, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) brother's, meaning after a while
to return to Kellynch, and act as circumstances might require.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was six weeks with Edward,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) happy. I could
have no other pleasure. I deserved none. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) enquired after you very
particularly; asked even if you were personally altered, little
suspecting that to my eye you could never alter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne smiled, and let it pass. It was too pleasing a blunder for a
reproach. It is something for a woman to be assured, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
eight-and-twentieth year, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has not lost one charm of earlier
youth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to
Anne, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be the
result, not the cause of a revival of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) warm attachment.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had remained in Shropshire, lamenting the blindness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) own
pride, and the blunders of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) own calculations, till at once released
from Louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>)
engagement with Benwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Benwick</b></font>), ``ended the worst of my state; for now I could at least
put myself in the way of happiness; I could exert myself; I could do
something. But to be waiting so long in inaction, and waiting only for
evil, had been dreadful. Within the first five minutes I said, ``I will
be at Bath on Wednesday,'' and I was. Was it unpardonable to think it
worth my while to come? and to arrive with some degree of hope? You
were single. It was possible that you might retain the feelings of the
past, as I did; and one encouragement happened to be mine. I could
never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others, but I knew to
a certainty that you had refused one man, at least, of better
pretensions than myself; and I could not help often saying, <div class="bookquote">``Was this
for me?'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Their first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said, but the
concert still more. That evening seemed to be made up of exquisite
moments. The moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) stepping forward in the Octagon Room to
speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): the moment of Mr Elliot's appearing and tearing her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
away, and one or two subsequent moments, marked by returning hope or
increasing despondency, were dwelt on with energy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``in the midst of those who could not be my
well-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling,
and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match!
To consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to
influence you! Even if your own feelings were reluctant or
indifferent, to consider what powerful supports would be his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)! Was it
not enough to make the fool of me which I appeared? How could I look
on without agony? Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind
you, was not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
influence, the indelible, immoveable impression of what persuasion had
once done--was it not all against me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should have distinguished,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>replied Anne. <div class="bookquote">``You should not have
suspected me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different.
If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that it was to
persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk. When I yielded,
I thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called in aid here. In
marrying a man indifferent to me, all risk would have been incurred,
and all duty violated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``but I could not.
I could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired of
your character. I could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed,
buried, lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under
year after year. I could think of you only as one who had yielded, who
had given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than by me.
I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of
misery. I had no reason to believe her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) of less authority now. The
force of habit was to be added.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Anne, <div class="bookquote">``that my manner to yourself might
have spared you much or all of this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to
another man would give. I left you in this belief; and yet, I was
determined to see you again. My spirits rallied with the morning, and
I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>At last Anne was at home again, and happier than any one in that house
could have conceived. All the surprise and suspense, and every other
painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some
momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last. An interval
of meditation, serious and grateful, was the best corrective of
everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
room, and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
enjoyment.

<p/>The evening came, the drawing-rooms were lighted up, the company
assembled. It was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those who
had never met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace
business, too numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but Anne
had never found an evening shorter. Glowing and lovely in sensibility
and happiness, and more generally admired than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thought about or
cared for, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature
around her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Mr Elliot was there; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) avoided, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>).
The Wallises, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had amusement in understanding them. Lady Dalrymple
and Miss Carteret--they would soon be innoxious cousins to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>)
cared not for Mrs Clay, and had nothing to blush for in the public
manners of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) father and sister. With the Musgroves, there was the
happy chat of perfect ease; with Captain Harville, the kind-hearted
intercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Russell, attempts at
conversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short; with Admiral
and Mrs Croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest,
which the same consciousness sought to conceal; and with Captain
Wentworth, some moments of communications continually occurring, and
always the hope of more, and always the knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) being there.

<p/>It was in one of these short meetings, each apparently occupied in
admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially to judge of
the right and wrong, I mean with regard to myself; and I must believe
that I was right, much as I suffered from it, that I was perfectly
right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you
do now. To me, she (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>) was in the place of a parent. Do not mistake me,
however. I am not saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>) did not err in her (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>) advice. It was,
perhaps, one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the
event decides; and for myself, I certainly never should, in any
circumstance of tolerable similarity, give such advice. But I mean,
that I was right in submitting to her (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>), and that if I had done
otherwise, I should have suffered more in continuing the engagement
than I did even in giving it up, because I should have suffered in my
conscience. I have now, as far as such a sentiment is allowable in
human nature, nothing to reproach myself with; and if I mistake not, a
strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman's portion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>), looked at Lady Russell, and looking again at her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>),
replied, as if in cool deliberation--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet. But there are hopes of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) being forgiven in time. I trust
to being in charity with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soon. But I too have been thinking over
the past, and a question has suggested itself, whether there may not
have been one person more my enemy even than that lady? My own self.
Tell me if, when I returned to England in the year eight, with a few
thousand pounds, and was posted into the Laconia, if I had then written
to you, would you have answered my letter? Would you, in short, have
renewed the engagement then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would I!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was all her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) answer; but the accent was decisive enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``you would! It is not that I did not think of
it, or desire it, as what could alone crown all my other success; but I
was proud, too proud to ask again. I did not understand you. I shut
my eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice. This is a
recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than
myself. Six years of separation and suffering might have been spared.
It is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me. I have been used to the
gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that I
enjoyed. I have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards.
Like other great men under reverses,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) added, with a smile. <div class="bookquote">``I must
endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune. I must learn to brook being
happier than I deserve.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 24


<p/>Who can be in doubt of what followed? When any two young people take
it into their heads to marry, they are pretty sure by perseverance to
carry their point, be they ever so poor, or ever so imprudent, or ever
so little likely to be necessary to each other's ultimate comfort.
This may be bad morality to conclude with, but I believe it to be
truth; and if such parties succeed, how should a Captain Wentworth and
an Anne Elliot, with the advantage of maturity of mind, consciousness
of right, and one independent fortune between them, fail of bearing
down every opposition? They might in fact, have borne down a great
deal more than they met with, for there was little to distress them
beyond the want of graciousness and warmth. Sir Walter made no
objection, and Elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold and
unconcerned. Captain Wentworth, with five-and-twenty thousand pounds,
and as high in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) profession as merit and activity could place him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>),
was no longer nobody. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was now esteemed quite worthy to address the
daughter of a foolish, spendthrift baronet, who had not had principle
or sense enough to maintain himself in the situation in which
Providence had placed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), and who could give his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) daughter at present
but a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers
hereafter.

<p/>Sir Walter, indeed, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had no affection for Anne, and no vanity
flattered, to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) really happy on the occasion, was very far from
thinking it a bad match for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). On the contrary, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) saw more of
Captain Wentworth, saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) repeatedly by daylight, and eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) well,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was very much struck by his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) personal claims, and felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) well-sounding name,
enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) pen, with a very good grace,
for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour.

<p/>The only one among them, whose opposition of feeling could excite any
serious anxiety was Lady Russell. Anne knew that Lady Russell must be
suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot, and
be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with, and do
justice to Captain Wentworth. This however was what Lady Russell had
now to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) must learn to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had been mistaken with
regard to both; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had been unfairly influenced by appearances in
each; that because Captain Wentworth's manners had not suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) own
ideas, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a
character of dangerous impetuosity; and that because Mr Elliot's
manners had precisely pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) in their propriety and correctness,
their general politeness and suavity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had been too quick in
receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and
well-regulated mind. There was nothing less for Lady Russell to do,
than to admit that she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had been pretty completely wrong, and to take up
a new set of opinions and of hopes.

<p/>There is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernment
of character, a natural penetration, in short, which no experience in
others can equal, and Lady Russell had been less gifted in this part of
understanding than her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) young friend. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was a very good woman,
and if her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) second object was to be sensible and well-judging, her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) first
was to see Anne happy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) loved Anne better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own
abilities; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over, found
little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was
securing the happiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) other child.

<p/>Of all the family, Mary was probably the one most immediately gratified
by the circumstance. It was creditable to have a sister married, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the
connexion, by keeping Anne with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in the autumn; and as her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own
sister must be better than her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) husband's sisters, it was very agreeable
that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than either Captain
Benwick or Charles Hayter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had something to suffer, perhaps, when
they came into contact again, in seeing Anne restored to the rights of
seniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had a
future to look forward to, of powerful consolation. Anne had no
Uppercross Hall before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), no landed estate, no headship of a family;
and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth from being made a baronet,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would not change situations with Anne.

<p/>It would be well for the eldest sister if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) were equally satisfied
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) situation, for a change is not very probable there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had
soon the mortification of seeing Mr Elliot withdraw, and no one of
proper condition has since presented himself to raise even the
unfounded hopes which sunk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>).

<p/>The news of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) cousin Anne's engagement burst on Mr Elliot most
unexpectedly. It deranged his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) best plan of domestic happiness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
best hope of keeping Sir Walter single by the watchfulness which a
son-in-law's rights would have given. But, though discomfited and
disappointed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) could still do something for his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) own interest and his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
own enjoyment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) soon quitted Bath; and on Mrs Clay's quitting it
soon afterwards, and being next heard of as established under his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
protection in London, it was evident how double a game he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had been
playing, and how determined he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was to save himself from being cut out
by one artful woman, at least.

<p/>Mrs Clay's affections had overpowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) interest, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) had
sacrificed, for the young man's sake, the possibility of scheming
longer for Sir Walter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) has abilities, however, as well as
affections; and it is now a doubtful point whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) cunning, or
hers, may finally carry the day; whether, after preventing her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) from
being the wife of Sir Walter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) may not be wheedled and caressed at
last into making her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) the wife of Sir William.

<p/>It cannot be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked and
mortified by the loss of their companion, and the discovery of their
deception in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). They had their great cousins, to be sure, to resort
to for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter and follow
others, without being flattered and followed in turn, is but a state of
half enjoyment.

<p/>Anne, satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell's meaning to
love Captain Wentworth as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ought, had no other alloy to the
happiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) prospects than what arose from the consciousness of
having no relations to bestow on him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) which a man of sense could value.
There she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own inferiority very keenly. The disproportion in
their fortune was nothing; it did not give her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) a moment's regret; but
to have no family to receive and estimate him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) properly, nothing of
respectability, of harmony, of good will to offer in return for all the
worth and all the prompt welcome which met her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brothers and
sisters, was a source of as lively pain as her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mind could well be
sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had
but two friends in the world to add to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) list, Lady Russell and Mrs
Smith. To those, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very well disposed to attach himself.
Lady Russell, in spite of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) former transgressions, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could now
value from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart. While he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not obliged to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) to have been right in originally dividing them, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was ready to say
almost everything else in her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) favour, and as for Mrs Smith, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had
claims of various kinds to recommend her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) quickly and permanently.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves, and
their marriage, instead of depriving her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) of one friend, secured her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
two. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was their earliest visitor in their settled life; and Captain
Wentworth, by putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) in the way of recovering her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) husband's
property in the West Indies, by writing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), acting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), and
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) through all the petty difficulties of the case with the
activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend, fully
requited the services which she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had rendered, or ever meant to render,
to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife.

<p/>Mrs Smith's enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income,
with some improvement of health, and the acquisition of such friends to
be often with, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not fail
her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>); and while these prime supplies of good remained, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) might have
bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy, and yet be
happy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) spring of felicity was in the glow of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) spirits, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
friend Anne's was in the warmth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heart. Anne was tenderness
itself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had the full worth of it in Captain Wentworth's
affection. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) profession was all that could ever make her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friends
wish that tenderness less, the dread of a future war all that could dim
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sunshine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) gloried in being a sailor's wife, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must pay
the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is, if
possible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its
national importance.
