<p/>Chapter I

<p/>HIRAM``S HOSPITAL


<p/>The Rev. Septimus Harding was, a few years since, a beneficed
clergyman residing in the cathedral town of --; let us call it
Barchester. Were we to name Wells or Salisbury, Exeter, Hereford, or
Gloucester, it might be presumed that something personal was intended;
and as this tale will refer mainly to the cathedral dignitaries of the
town in question, we are anxious that no personality may be suspected.
Let us presume that Barchester is a quiet town in the West of England,
more remarkable for the beauty of its cathedral and the antiquity of
its monuments than for any commercial prosperity; that the west end
of Barchester is the cathedral close, and that the aristocracy of
Barchester are the bishop, dean, and canons, with their respective
wives and daughters.

<p/>Early in life Mr Harding found himself located at Barchester. A fine
voice and a taste for sacred music had decided the position in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was to exercise his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) calling, and for many years he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) performed the
easy but not highly paid duties of a minor canon. At the age of forty
a small living in the close vicinity of the town increased both his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
work and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) income, and at the age of fifty he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) became precentor of
the cathedral.

<p/>Mr Harding had married early in life, and was the father of two
daughters. The eldest, Susan, was born soon after his (<font color='blue'><b>eldest</b></font>) marriage; the
other, Eleanor, not till ten years later.

<p/>At the time at which we introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>eldest</b></font>) to our readers he (<font color='blue'><b>eldest</b></font>) was living as
precentor at Barchester with his (<font color='blue'><b>eldest</b></font>) youngest daughter, then twenty-four
years of age; having been many years a widower, and having married his (<font color='blue'><b>widower</b></font>)
eldest daughter to a son of the bishop a very short time before his (<font color='blue'><b>widower</b></font>)
installation to the office of precentor.

<p/>Scandal at Barchester affirmed that had it not been for the beauty of
his (<font color='blue'><b>widower</b></font>) daughter, Mr Harding would have remained a minor canon; but here
probably Scandal lied, as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) so often does; for even as a minor canon
no one had been more popular among his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) reverend brethren in the close
than Mr Harding; and Scandal, before she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had reprobated Mr Harding for
being made precentor by his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) friend the bishop, had loudly blamed the
bishop for having so long omitted to do something for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) friend Mr
Harding. Be this as it may, Susan Harding, some twelve years since,
had married the Rev. Dr Theophilus Grantly, son of the bishop,
archdeacon of Barchester, and rector of Plumstead Episcopi, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)
father became, a few months later, precentor of Barchester Cathedral,
that office being, as is not unusual, in the bishop's gift.

<p/>Now there are peculiar circumstances connected with the precentorship
which must be explained. In the year 1434 there died at Barchester
one John Hiram, who had made money in the town as a wool-stapler, and
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) will he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) left the house in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) died and certain meadows and
closes near the town, still called Hiram's Butts, and Hiram's Patch,
for the support of twelve superannuated wool-carders, all of whom
should have been born and bred and spent their days in Barchester; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>)
also appointed that an alms-house should be built for their abode,
with a fitting residence for a warden, which warden was also to
receive a certain sum annually out of the rents of the said butts and
patches. He (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>), moreover, willed, having had a soul alive to harmony,
that the precentor of the cathedral should have the option of being
also warden of the almshouses, if the bishop in each case approved.

<p/>From that day to this the charity had gone on and prospered--at least,
the charity had gone on, and the estates had prospered. Wool-carding
in Barchester there was no longer any; so the bishop, dean, and
warden, who took it in turn to put in the old men, generally
appointed some hangers-on of their own; worn-out gardeners, decrepit
grave-diggers, or octogenarian sextons, who thankfully received a
comfortable lodging and one shilling and fourpence a day, such being
the stipend to which, under the will of John Hiram, they were declared
to be entitled. Formerly, indeed,--that is, till within some fifty
years of the present time,--they received but sixpence a day, and
their breakfast and dinner was found them at a common table by the
warden, such an arrangement being in stricter conformity with the
absolute wording of old Hiram's will: but this was thought to be
inconvenient, and to suit the tastes of neither warden nor bedesmen,
and the daily one shilling and fourpence was substituted with the
common consent of all parties, including the bishop and the
corporation of Barchester.

<p/>Such was the condition of Hiram's twelve old men when Mr Harding was
appointed warden; but if they may be considered as well-to-do in the
world according to their condition, the happy warden was much more so.
The patches and butts which, in John Hiram's time, produced hay or fed
cows, were now covered with rows of houses; the value of the property
had gradually increased from year to year and century to century, and
was now presumed by those who knew anything about it, to bring in
a very nice income; and by some who knew nothing about it, to have
increased to an almost fabulous extent.

<p/>The property was farmed by a gentleman in Barchester, who also acted
as the bishop's steward,--a man whose father and grandfather had been
stewards to the bishops of Barchester, and farmers of John Hiram's
estate. The Chadwicks had earned a good name in Barchester; they
had lived respected by bishops, deans, canons, and precentors; they
had been buried in the precincts of the cathedral; they had never
been known as griping, hard men, but had always lived comfortably,
maintained a good house, and held a high position in Barchester
society. The present Mr Chadwick was a worthy scion of a worthy
stock, and the tenants living on the butts and patches, as well as
those on the wide episcopal domains of the see, were well pleased to
have to do with so worthy and liberal a steward.

<p/>For many, many years,--records hardly tell how many, probably from
the time when Hiram's wishes had been first fully carried out,--the
proceeds of the estate had been paid by the steward or farmer to the
warden, and by him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) divided among the bedesmen; after which division
he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) paid himself such sums as became his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) due. Times had been when the
poor warden got nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) bare house, for the patches had been
subject to floods, and the land of Barchester butts was said to be
unproductive; and in these hard times the warden was hardly able to
make out the daily dole for his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) twelve dependents. But by degrees
things mended; the patches were drained, and cottages began to
rise upon the butts, and the wardens, with fairness enough, repaid
themselves for the evil days gone by. In bad times the poor men had
had their due, and therefore in good times they could expect no more.
In this manner the income of the warden had increased; the picturesque
house attached to the hospital had been enlarged and adorned, and
the office had become one of the most coveted of the snug clerical
sinecures attached to our church. It was now wholly in the bishop's
gift, and though the dean and chapter, in former days, made a stand
on the subject, they had thought it more conducive to their honour
to have a rich precentor appointed by the bishop, than a poor one
appointed by themselves. The stipend of the precentor of Barchester
was eighty pounds a year. The income arising from the wardenship of
the hospital was eight hundred, besides the value of the house.

<p/>Murmurs, very slight murmurs, had been heard in Barchester,--few
indeed, and far between,--that the proceeds of John Hiram's property
had not been fairly divided: but they can hardly be said to have been
of such a nature as to have caused uneasiness to anyone: still the
thing had been whispered, and Mr Harding had heard it. Such was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
character in Barchester, so universal was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) popularity, that the
very fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) appointment would have quieted louder whispers
than those which had been heard; but Mr Harding was an open-handed,
just-minded man, and feeling that there might be truth in what had
been said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) instalment, declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) intention of adding
twopence a day to each man's pittance, making a sum of sixty-two
pounds eleven shillings and fourpence, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was to pay out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) own pocket. In doing so, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) distinctly and repeatedly
observed to the men, that though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) promised for himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) could not
promise for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) successors, and that the extra twopence could only
be looked on as a gift from himself, and not from the trust. The
bedesmen, however, were most of them older than Mr Harding, and were
quite satisfied with the security on which their extra income was
based.

<p/>This munificence on the part of Mr Harding had not been unopposed.
Mr Chadwick had mildly but seriously dissuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) from it; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>)
strong-minded son-in-law, the archdeacon, the man of whom alone Mr
Harding stood in awe, had urgently, nay, vehemently, opposed so
impolitic a concession: but the warden had made known his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) intention
to the hospital before the archdeacon had been able to interfere,
and the deed was done.

<p/>Hiram's Hospital, as the retreat is called, is a picturesque building
enough, and shows the correct taste with which the ecclesiastical
architects of those days were imbued. It stands on the banks of the
little river, which flows nearly round the cathedral close, being on
the side furthest from the town. The London road crosses the river
by a pretty one-arched bridge, and, looking from this bridge, the
stranger will see the windows of the old men's rooms, each pair of
windows separated by a small buttress. A broad gravel walk runs
between the building and the river, which is always trim and cared
for; and at the end of the walk, under the parapet of the approach to
the bridge, is a large and well-worn seat, on which, in mild weather,
three or four of Hiram's bedesmen are sure to be seen seated. Beyond
this row of buttresses, and further from the bridge, and also further
from the water which here suddenly bends, are the pretty oriel windows
of Mr Harding's house, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) well-mown lawn. The entrance to the
hospital is from the London road, and is made through a ponderous
gateway under a heavy stone arch, unnecessary, one would suppose, at
any time, for the protection of twelve old men, but greatly conducive
to the good appearance of Hiram's charity. On passing through this
portal, never closed to anyone from 6 A.M. till 10 P.M., and never
open afterwards, except on application to a huge, intricately hung
mediæval bell, the handle of which no uninitiated intruder can
possibly find, the six doors of the old men's abodes are seen, and
beyond them is a slight iron screen, through which the more happy
portion of the Barchester elite pass into the Elysium of Mr Harding's
dwelling.

<p/>Mr Harding is a small man, now verging on sixty years, but bearing few
of the signs of age; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) hair is rather grizzled, though not gray;
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) eye is very mild, but clear and bright, though the double glasses
which are held swinging from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) hand, unless when fixed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
nose, show that time has told upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) sight; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) hands are delicately
white, and both hands and feet are small; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) always wears a black
frock coat, black knee-breeches, and black gaiters, and somewhat
scandalises some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) more hyperclerical brethren by a black
neck-handkerchief.

<p/>Mr Harding's warmest admirers cannot say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was ever an
industrious man; the circumstances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) life have not called on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) to be so; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) can hardly be called an idler. Since his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
appointment to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) precentorship, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) has published, with all possible
additions of vellum, typography, and gilding, a collection of our
ancient church music, with some correct dissertations on Purcell,
Crotch, and Nares. He (<font color='blue'><b>Purcell</b></font>) has greatly improved the choir of Barchester,
which, under his (<font color='blue'><b>Purcell</b></font>) dominion, now rivals that of any cathedral in
England. He (<font color='blue'><b>Purcell</b></font>) has taken something more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Purcell</b></font>) fair share in the
cathedral services, and has played the violoncello daily to such
audiences as he (<font color='blue'><b>Purcell</b></font>) could collect, or, _faute de mieux_, to no audience
at all.

<p/>We must mention one other peculiarity of Mr Harding. As we have
before stated, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) has an income of eight hundred a year, and has no
family but his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) one daughter; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) is never quite at ease in
money matters. The vellum and gilding of <div class="bookquote">``Harding's Church Music''
 (<font color='red'><b>the author publisher</b></font>)</div>cost more than any one knows, except the author, the publisher, and
the Rev. Theophilus Grantly, who allows none of his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) father-in-law's
extravagances to escape him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) is generous to his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) daughter, for
whose service he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) keeps a small carriage and pair of ponies. He (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) is,
indeed, generous to all, but especially to the twelve old men who are
in a peculiar manner under his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) care. No doubt with such an income Mr
Harding should be above the world, as the saying is; but, at any rate,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) is not above Archdeacon Theophilus Grantly, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) is always more
or less in debt to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) son-in-law, who has, to a certain extent,
assumed the arrangement of the precentor's pecuniary affairs.




<p/>Chapter II

<p/>THE BARCHESTER REFORMER


<p/>Mr Harding has been now precentor of Barchester for ten years; and,
alas, the murmurs respecting the proceeds of Hiram's estate are again
becoming audible. It is not that any one begrudges to Mr Harding
the income which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) enjoys, and the comfortable place which so well
becomes him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>); but such matters have begun to be talked of in various
parts of England. Eager pushing politicians have asserted in the
House of Commons, with very telling indignation, that the grasping
priests of the Church of England are gorged with the wealth which the
charity of former times has left for the solace of the aged, or the
education of the young. The well-known case of the Hospital of St
Cross has even come before the law courts of the country, and the
struggles of Mr Whiston, at Rochester, have met with sympathy and
support. Men are beginning to say that these things must be looked
into.

<p/>Mr Harding, whose conscience in the matter is clear, and who has never
felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had received a pound from Hiram's will to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) was
not entitled, has naturally taken the part of the church in talking
over these matters with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) friend, the bishop, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) son-in-law,
the archdeacon. The archdeacon, indeed, Dr Grantly, has been somewhat
loud in the matter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) is a personal friend of the dignitaries of the
Rochester Chapter, and has written letters in the public press on the
subject of that turbulent Dr Whiston, which, his (<font color='blue'><b>Whiston</b></font>) admirers think, must
well nigh set the question at rest. It is also known at Oxford that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Whiston</b></font>) is the author of the pamphlet signed <div class="bookquote">``Sacerdos''  (<font color='red'><b>the author</b></font>)</div>on the subject of
the Earl of Guildford and St Cross, in which it is so clearly argued
that the manners of the present times do not admit of a literal
adhesion to the very words of the founder's will, but that the
interests of the church for which the founder was so deeply concerned
are best consulted in enabling its bishops to reward those shining
lights whose services have been most signally serviceable to
Christianity. In answer to this, it is asserted that Henry de Blois,
founder of St Cross, was not greatly interested in the welfare of the
reformed church, and that the masters of St Cross, for many years
past, cannot be called shining lights in the service of Christianity;
it is, however, stoutly maintained, and no doubt felt, by all the
archdeacon's friends, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) logic is conclusive, and has not, in
fact, been answered.

<p/>With such a tower of strength to back both his (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) arguments and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>)
conscience, it may be imagined that Mr Harding has never felt any
compunction as to receiving his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) quarterly sum of two hundred pounds.
Indeed, the subject has never presented itself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) mind in that
shape. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) has talked not unfrequently, and heard very much about the
wills of old founders and the incomes arising from their estates,
during the last year or two; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) did even, at one moment, feel a
doubt -LRB-since expelled by his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) son-in-law's logic-RRB- as to whether Lord
Guildford was clearly entitled to receive so enormous an income
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) does from the revenues of St Cross; but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) himself was
overpaid with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) modest eight hundred pounds,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) who, out of that,
voluntarily gave up sixty-two pounds eleven shillings and fourpence a
year to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) twelve old neighbours,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) who, for the money, does his (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>)
precentor's work as no precentor has done it before, since Barchester
Cathedral was built,--such an idea has never sullied his (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) quiet, or
disturbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) conscience.

<p/>Nevertheless, Mr Harding is becoming uneasy at the rumour which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
knows to prevail in Barchester on the subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) is aware that, at
any rate, two of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) old men have been heard to say, that if everyone
had his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) own, they might each have their hundred pounds a year, and
live like gentlemen, instead of a beggarly one shilling and sixpence
a day; and that they had slender cause to be thankful for a miserable
dole of twopence, when Mr Harding and Mr Chadwick, between them, ran
away with thousands of pounds which good old John Hiram never intended
for the like of them. It is the ingratitude of this which stings Mr
Harding. One of this discontented pair, Abel Handy, was put into the
hospital by himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Handy</b></font>) had been a stone-mason in Barchester, and had
broken his (<font color='blue'><b>Handy</b></font>) thigh by a fall from a scaffolding, while employed about
the cathedral; and Mr Harding had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) the first vacancy in the
hospital after the occurrence, although Dr Grantly had been very
anxious to put into it an insufferable clerk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) at Plumstead
Episcopi, who had lost all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) teeth, and whom the archdeacon hardly
knew how to get rid of by other means. Dr Grantly has not forgotten
to remind Mr Harding how well satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) one-and-sixpence a
day old Joe Mutters would have been, and how injudicious it was on the
part of Mr Harding to allow a radical from the town to get into the
concern. Probably Dr Grantly forgot, at the moment, that the charity
was intended for broken-down journeymen of Barchester.

<p/>There is living at Barchester, a young man, a surgeon, named John
Bold, and both Mr Harding and Dr Grantly are well aware that to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
is owing the pestilent rebellious feeling which has shown itself in
the hospital; yes, and the renewal, too, of that disagreeable talk
about Hiram's estates which is now again prevalent in Barchester.
Nevertheless, Mr Harding and Mr Bold are acquainted with each other;
we may say, are friends, considering the great disparity in their
years. Dr Grantly, however, has a holy horror of the impious
demagogue, as on one occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>demagogue</b></font>) called Bold, when speaking of him (<font color='blue'><b>demagogue</b></font>)
to the precentor; and being a more prudent far-seeing man than Mr
Harding, and possessed of a stronger head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) already perceives that
this John Bold will work great trouble in Barchester. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) considers
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) is to be regarded as an enemy, and thinks that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) should not
be admitted into the camp on anything like friendly terms. As John
Bold will occupy much of our attention, we must endeavour to explain
who he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) is, and why he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) takes the part of John Hiram's bedesmen.

<p/>John Bold is a young surgeon, who passed many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) boyish years at
Barchester. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) father was a physician in the city of London, where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) made a moderate fortune, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) invested in houses in that city.
The Dragon of Wantly inn and posting-house belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>), also four
shops in the High Street, and a moiety of the new row of genteel
villas -LRB-so called in the advertisements-RRB-, built outside the town just
beyond Hiram's Hospital. To one of these Dr Bold retired to spend
the evening of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) life, and to die; and here his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) son John spent his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
holidays, and afterwards his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) Christmas vacation when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) went from
school to study surgery in the London hospitals. Just as John Bold
was entitled to write himself surgeon and apothecary, old Dr Bold
died, leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) Barchester property to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) son, and a certain sum in
the three per cents. to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) daughter Mary, who is some four or five
years older than her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) brother.

<p/>John Bold determined to settle himself at Barchester, and look after
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) own property, as well as the bones and bodies of such of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>)
neighbours as would call upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) for assistance in their troubles.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) therefore put up a large brass plate with <div class="bookquote">``John Bold, Surgeon''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>on
it, to the great disgust of the nine practitioners who were already
trying to get a living out of the bishop, dean, and canons; and began
house-keeping with the aid of his (<font color='blue'><b>dean</b></font>) sister. At this time he (<font color='blue'><b>dean</b></font>) was not
more than twenty-four years old; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>dean</b></font>) has now been three
years in Barchester, we have not heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>dean</b></font>) has done much harm to
the nine worthy practitioners. Indeed, their dread of him (<font color='blue'><b>dean</b></font>) has died
away; for in three years he (<font color='blue'><b>dean</b></font>) has not taken three fees.

<p/>Nevertheless, John Bold is a clever man, and would, with practice,
be a clever surgeon; but he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) has got quite into another line of life.
Having enough to live on, he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) has not been forced to work for bread;
he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) has declined to subject himself to what he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) calls the drudgery of
the profession, by which, I believe, he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) means the general work of a
practising surgeon; and has found other employment. He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) frequently
binds up the bruises and sets the limbs of such of the poorer classes
as profess his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) way of thinking,--but this he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) does for love. Now I
will not say that the archdeacon is strictly correct in stigmatising
John Bold as a demagogue, for I hardly know how extreme must be a
man's opinions before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can be justly so called; but Bold is a strong
reformer. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passion is the reform of all abuses; state abuses,
church abuses, corporation abuses -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has got himself elected a town
councillor of Barchester, and has so worried three consecutive mayors,
that it became somewhat difficult to find a fourth-RRB-, abuses in
medical practice, and general abuses in the world at large. Bold is
thoroughly sincere in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) patriotic endeavours to mend mankind, and
there is something to be admired in the energy with which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) devotes
himself to remedying evil and stopping injustice; but I fear that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is too much imbued with the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a special mission
for reforming. It would be well if one so young had a little
more diffidence himself, and more trust in the honest purposes of
others,--if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could be brought to believe that old customs need not
necessarily be evil, and that changes may possibly be dangerous; but
no, Bold has all the ardour and all the self-assurance of a Danton,
and hurls his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) anathemas against time-honoured practices with the
violence of a French Jacobin.

<p/>No wonder that Dr Grantly should regard Bold as a firebrand, falling,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>firebrand</b></font>) has done, almost in the centre of the quiet ancient close of
Barchester Cathedral. Dr Grantly would have him (<font color='blue'><b>firebrand</b></font>) avoided as the
plague; but the old Doctor and Mr Harding were fast friends. Young
Johnny Bold used to play as a boy on Mr Harding's lawn; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) has many a
time won the precentor's heart by listening with rapt attention to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
sacred strains; and since those days, to tell the truth at once, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
has nearly won another heart within the same walls.

<p/>Eleanor Harding has not plighted her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) troth to John Bold, nor has she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>),
perhaps, owned to herself how dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) the young reformer is; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) cannot endure that anyone should speak harshly of him (<font color='blue'><b>reformer</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) does
not dare to defend him (<font color='blue'><b>reformer</b></font>) when her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) brother-in-law is so loud against him (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>);
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), like her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) father, is somewhat afraid of Dr Grantly; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) is
beginning greatly to dislike the archdeacon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) persuades her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) father
that it would be both unjust and injudicious to banish his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) young
friend because of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) politics; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) cares little to go to houses where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) will not meet him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and, in fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) is in love.

<p/>Nor is there any good reason why Eleanor Harding should not love John
Bold. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) has all those qualities which are likely to touch a girl's
heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) is brave, eager, and amusing; well-made and good-looking;
young and enterprising; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) character is in all respects good; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) has
sufficient income to support a wife; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) is her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father's friend; and,
above all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) is in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>): then why should not Eleanor Harding
be attached to John Bold?

<p/>Dr Grantly, who has as many eyes as Argus, and has long seen how the
wind blows in that direction, thinks there are various strong reasons
why this should not be so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) has not thought it wise as yet to
speak to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) father-in-law on the subject, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) knows how foolishly
indulgent is Mr Harding in everything that concerns his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) daughter; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) has discussed the matter with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) all-trusted helpmate, within
that sacred recess formed by the clerical bed-curtains at Plumstead
Episcopi.

<p/>How much sweet solace, how much valued counsel has our archdeacon
received within that sainted enclosure! ``Tis there alone that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>)
unbends, and comes down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) high church pedestal to the level of
a mortal man. In the world Dr Grantly never lays aside that demeanour
which so well becomes him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) has all the dignity of an ancient saint
with the sleekness of a modern bishop; he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) is always the same; he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) is
always the archdeacon; unlike Homer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) never nods. Even with his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>)
father-in-law, even with the bishop and dean, he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) maintains that
sonorous tone and lofty deportment which strikes awe into the
young hearts of Barchester, and absolutely cows the whole parish of
Plumstead Episcopi. ``Tis only when he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) has exchanged that ever-new
shovel hat for a tasselled nightcap, and those shining black
habiliments for his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) accustomed _robe de nuit_, that Dr Grantly talks,
and looks, and thinks like an ordinary man.

<p/>Many of us have often thought how severe a trial of faith must this
be to the wives of our great church dignitaries. To us these men are
personifications of St Paul; their very gait is a speaking sermon;
their clean and sombre apparel exacts from us faith and submission,
and the cardinal virtues seem to hover round their sacred hats.
A dean or archbishop, in the garb of his (<font color='blue'><b>dean</b></font>) order, is sure of our
reverence, and a well-got-up bishop fills our very souls with awe.
But how can this feeling be perpetuated in the bosoms of those who see
the bishops without their aprons, and the archdeacons even in a lower
state of dishabille?

<p/>Do we not all know some reverend, all but sacred, personage before
whom our tongue ceases to be loud and our step to be elastic? But
were we once to see him (<font color='blue'><b>reverend</b></font>) stretch himself beneath the bed-clothes, yawn
widely, and bury his (<font color='blue'><b>reverend</b></font>) face upon his (<font color='blue'><b>reverend</b></font>) pillow, we could chatter before
him (<font color='blue'><b>reverend</b></font>) as glibly as before a doctor or a lawyer. From some such cause,
doubtless, it arose that our archdeacon listened to the counsels of
his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) wife, though he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) considered himself entitled to give counsel to
every other being whom he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) met.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) adjusted the copious folds of his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) nightcap,
<div class="bookquote">``there was that John Bold at your father's again to-day. I must say
your father is very imprudent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is imprudent;--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Grantly</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs Grantly, speaking from
under the comfortable bed-clothes. <div class="bookquote">``There's nothing new in that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear, there's nothing new;--I know that; but, at the present

with Eleanor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will, whether papa takes care or no; and why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not!''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>almost screamed the archdeacon, giving so rough a pull at
his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) nightcap as almost to bring it over his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) nose; <div class="bookquote">``why not!--that
pestilent, interfering upstart, John Bold;--the most vulgar young
person I ever met! Do you know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) is meddling with your father's
affairs in a most uncalled-for--most--''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>And being at a loss for an
epithet sufficiently injurious, he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) finished his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) expressions of horror
by muttering, <div class="bookquote">``Good heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in a manner that had been found very
efficacious in clerical meetings of the diocese. He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) must for the
moment have forgotten where he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) vulgarity, archdeacon''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Grantly</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Mrs Grantly had never assumed a
more familiar term than this in addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>) husband-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``I don't
agree with you. Not that I like Mr Bold;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) is a great deal too
conceited for me; but then Eleanor does, and it would be the best
thing in the world for papa if they were to marry. Bold would never
trouble himself about Hiram's Hospital if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) were papa's son-in-law.''
 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>And the lady turned herself round under the bed-clothes, in a manner
to which the doctor was well accustomed, and which told him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), as
plainly as words, that as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>) was concerned the subject was
over for that night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>murmured the doctor again;--he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was evidently much put
beside himself.

<p/>Dr Grantly is by no means a bad man; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is exactly the man which such
an education as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was most likely to form; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intellect being
sufficient for such a place in the world, but not sufficient to put
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in advance of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) performs with a rigid constancy such of the
duties of a parish clergyman as are, to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thinking, above the sphere
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) curate, but it is as an archdeacon that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shines.

<p/>We believe, as a general rule, that either a bishop or his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) archdeacons
have sinecures: where a bishop works, archdeacons have but little to
do, and _vice versa_. In the diocese of Barchester the Archdeacon
of Barchester does the work. In that capacity he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) is diligent,
authoritative, and, as his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) friends particularly boast, judicious. His (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
great fault is an overbearing assurance of the virtues and claims of
his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) order, and his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) great foible is an equally strong confidence in the
dignity of his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) own manner and the eloquence of his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) own words. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) is a
moral man, believing the precepts which he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) teaches, and believing also
that he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) acts up to them; though we cannot say that he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) would give his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
coat to the man who took his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) cloak, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) is prepared to forgive
his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) brother even seven times. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) is severe enough in exacting his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
dues, considering that any laxity in this respect would endanger the
security of the church; and, could he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) have his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) way, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) would consign
to darkness and perdition, not only every individual reformer, but
every committee and every commission that would even dare to ask a
question respecting the appropriation of church revenues.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are church revenues: the laity admit it. Surely the church is
able to administer her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) own revenues.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Twas thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) was accustomed to
argue, when the sacrilegious doings of Lord John Russell and others
were discussed either at Barchester or at Oxford.

<p/>It was no wonder that Dr Grantly did not like John Bold, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>)
wife's suggestion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) should become closely connected with such a
man dismayed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). To give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) due, the archdeacon never wanted
courage; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was quite willing to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enemy on any field and with
any weapon. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had that belief in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own arguments that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt sure
of success, could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only be sure of a fair fight on the part of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
adversary. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no idea that John Bold could really prove that the
income of the hospital was malappropriated; why, then, should peace be
sought for on such base terms? What! bribe an unbelieving enemy of
the church with the sister-in-law of one dignitary and the daughter
of another--with a young lady whose connections with the diocese and
chapter of Barchester were so close as to give her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) an undeniable claim
to a husband endowed with some of its sacred wealth! When Dr Grantly
talks of unbelieving enemies, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) does not mean to imply want of belief
in the doctrines of the church, but an equally dangerous scepticism as
to its purity in money matters.

<p/>Mrs Grantly is not usually deaf to the claims of the high order to
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>) belongs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>) husband rarely disagree as to the tone
with which the church should be defended; how singular, then, that in
such a case as this she (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>) should be willing to succumb! The archdeacon
again murmurs <div class="bookquote">``Good heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>The archdeacon</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) lays himself beside her (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
does so in a voice audible only to himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) repeats it till
sleep relieves him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) from deep thought.

<p/>Mr Harding himself has seen no reason why his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) daughter should not love
John Bold. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) has not been unobservant of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) feelings, and perhaps
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) deepest regret at the part which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) fears Bold is about to take
regarding the hospital arises from the dread that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) may be separated
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) daughter, or that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) may be separated from the man she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
loves. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) has never spoken to Eleanor about her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) lover; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) is the
last man in the world to allude to such a subject unconsulted, even
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) own daughter; and had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) considered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had ground to
disapprove of Bold, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) would have removed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), or forbidden him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
house; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) saw no such ground. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) would probably have preferred a
second clerical son-in-law, for Mr Harding, also, is attached to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
order; and, failing in that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) would at any rate have wished that
so near a connection should have thought alike with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) on church
matters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) would not, however, reject the man his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) daughter loved
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) differed on such subjects with himself.

<p/>Hitherto Bold had taken no steps in the matter in any way annoying
to Mr Harding personally. Some months since, after a severe battle,
which cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) not a little money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) gained a victory over a certain
old turnpike woman in the neighbourhood, of whose charges another old
woman had complained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) got the Act of Parliament relating
to the trust, found that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) _protégée_ had been wrongly taxed,
rode through the gate himself, paying the toll, then brought an
action against the gate-keeper, and proved that all people coming
up a certain by-lane, and going down a certain other by-lane, were
toll-free. The fame of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) success spread widely abroad, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
began to be looked on as the upholder of the rights of the poor of
Barchester. Not long after this success, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) heard from different
quarters that Hiram's bedesmen were treated as paupers, whereas the
property to which they were, in effect, heirs was very large; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
was instigated by the lawyer whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had employed in the case of the
turnpike to call upon Mr Chadwick for a statement as to the funds of
the estate.

<p/>Bold had often expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) indignation at the malappropriation of
church funds in general, in the hearing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) friend the precentor;
but the conversation had never referred to anything at Barchester; and
when Finney, the attorney, induced him (<font color='blue'><b>Finney</b></font>) to interfere with the affairs
of the hospital, it was against Mr Chadwick that his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) efforts were to
be directed. Bold soon found that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) interfered with Mr Chadwick
as steward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) must also interfere with Mr Harding as warden; and
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) regretted the situation in which this would place him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
was not the man to flinch from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) undertaking from personal motives.

<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had determined to take the matter in hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) set
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) work with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) usual energy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) got a copy of John Hiram's
will, of the wording of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) made himself perfectly master. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>)
ascertained the extent of the property, and as nearly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) could the
value of it; and made out a schedule of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) was informed was the
present distribution of its income. Armed with these particulars,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) called on Mr Chadwick, having given that gentleman notice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>)
visit; and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) for a statement of the income and expenditure of
the hospital for the last twenty-five years.

<p/>This was of course refused, Mr Chadwick alleging that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) had no
authority for making public the concerns of a property in managing
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) was only a paid servant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And who is competent to give you that authority, Mr Chadwick?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked
Bold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only those who employ me, Mr Bold,''  (<font color='red'><b>the steward</b></font>)</div>said the steward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And who are those, Mr Chadwick?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>demanded Bold.

<p/>Mr Chadwick begged to say that if these inquiries were made merely
out of curiosity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) must decline answering them: if Mr Bold had any
ulterior proceeding in view, perhaps it would be desirable that any
necessary information should be sought for in a professional way by
a professional man. Mr Chadwick's attorneys were Messrs Cox and
Cummins, of Lincoln's Inn. Mr Bold took down the address of Cox and
Cummins, remarked that the weather was cold for the time of the year,
and wished Mr Chadwick good-morning. Mr Chadwick said it was cold
for June, and bowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) out.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) at once went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) lawyer, Finney. Now, Bold was not very fond
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) attorney, but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) merely wanted a man who knew the
forms of law, and who would do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) was told for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>)
had no idea of putting himself in the hands of a lawyer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) wanted
law from a lawyer as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) did a coat from a tailor, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) could
not make it so well himself; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) thought Finney the fittest man
in Barchester for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) purpose. In one respect, at any rate, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
right: Finney was humility itself.

<p/>Finney advised an instant letter to Cox and Cummins, mindful of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cummins</b></font>) six-and-eightpence. <div class="bookquote">``Slap at them at once, Mr Bold. Demand
categorically and explicitly a full statement of the affairs of the
hospital.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose I were to see Mr Harding first,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>suggested Bold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, by all means,''  (<font color='red'><b>Finney/Mr Finney</b></font>)</div>said the acquiescing Finney; <div class="bookquote">``though,
perhaps, as Mr Harding is no man of business, it may lead--lead
to some little difficulties; but perhaps you're right. Mr Bold, I
don't think seeing Mr Harding can do any harm.''  (<font color='red'><b>Finney/Mr Finney</b></font>)</div>Finney saw from the
expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Finney</b></font>) client's face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Finney</b></font>) intended to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Finney</b></font>) own way.




<p/>Chapter III

<p/>THE BISHOP OF BARCHESTER


<p/>Bold at once repaired to the hospital. The day was now far advanced,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Finney</b></font>) knew that Mr Harding dined in the summer at four, that Eleanor
was accustomed to drive in the evening, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) might therefore
probably find Mr Harding alone. It was between seven and eight when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) reached the slight iron gate leading into the precentor's garden,
and though, as Mr Chadwick observed, the day had been cold for June,
the evening was mild, and soft, and sweet. The little gate was open.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) raised the latch he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) heard the notes of Mr Harding's violoncello
from the far end of the garden, and, advancing before the house
and across the lawn, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) playing;--and not without an
audience. The musician was seated in a garden-chair just within the
summer-house, so as to allow the violoncello which he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) held between his (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>)
knees to rest upon the dry stone flooring; before him (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) stood a rough
music desk, on which was open a page of that dear sacred book, that
much-laboured and much-loved volume of church music, which had cost so
many guineas; and around sat, and lay, and stood, and leaned, ten of
the twelve old men who dwelt with him (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) beneath old John Hiram's roof.
The two reformers were not there. I will not say that in their hearts
they were conscious of any wrong done or to be done to their mild
warden, but latterly they had kept aloof from him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) music was
no longer to their taste.

<p/>It was amusing to see the positions, and eager listening faces of
these well-to-do old men. I will not say that they all appreciated
the music which they heard, but they were intent on appearing to
do so; pleased at being where they were, they were determined, as
far as in them lay, to give pleasure in return; and they were not
unsuccessful. It gladdened the precentor's heart to think that the
old bedesmen whom he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) loved so well admired the strains which were to
him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) so full of almost ecstatic joy; and he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) used to boast that such was
the air of the hospital, as to make it a precinct specially fit for
the worship of St Cecilia.

<p/>Immediately before him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>), on the extreme corner of the bench which
ran round the summer-house, sat one old man, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) handkerchief
smoothly lain upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees, who did enjoy the moment, or acted
enjoyment well. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was one on whose large frame many years, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was over eighty, had made small havoc;--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was still an upright,
burly, handsome figure, with an open, ponderous brow, round which
clung a few, though very few, thin gray locks. The coarse black gown
of the hospital, the breeches, and buckled shoes became him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) well; and
as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands folded on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) staff, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chin resting on
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was such a listener as most musicians would be glad to
welcome.

<p/>This man was certainly the pride of the hospital. It had always been
the custom that one should be selected as being to some extent in
authority over the others; and though Mr Bunce, for such was his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) name,
and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) was always designated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) inferior brethren, had no
greater emoluments than they, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) had assumed, and well knew how to
maintain, the dignity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) elevation. The precentor delighted to
call him (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) sub-warden, and was not ashamed, occasionally, when no
other guest was there, to bid him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) sit down by the same parlour fire,
and drink the full glass of port which was placed near him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>). Bunce
never went without the second glass, but no entreaty ever made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>)
take a third.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, Mr Harding; you're too good, much too good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>)'d always
say, as the second glass was filled; but when that was drunk, and the
half hour over, Bunce stood erect, and with a benediction which his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>)
patron valued, retired to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) own abode. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) knew the world too well
to risk the comfort of such halcyon moments, by prolonging them till
they were disagreeable.

<p/>Mr Bunce, as may be imagined, was most strongly opposed to innovation.
Not even Dr Grantly had a more holy horror of those who would
interfere in the affairs of the hospital; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) was every inch a
churchman, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) was not very fond of Dr Grantly personally,
that arose from there not being room in the hospital for two people
so much alike as the doctor and himself, rather than from any
dissimilarity in feeling. Mr Bunce was inclined to think that
the warden and himself could manage the hospital without further
assistance; and that, though the bishop was the constitutional
visitor, and as such entitled to special reverence from all connected
with John Hiram's will, John Hiram never intended that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) affairs
should be interfered with by an archdeacon.

<p/>At the present moment, however, these cares were off his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) mind, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>)
was looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) warden, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) thought the music heavenly,
and the musician hardly less so.

<p/>As Bold walked silently over the lawn, Mr Harding did not at first
perceive him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), and continued to draw his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) bow slowly across the
plaintive wires; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) soon found from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) audience that some
stranger was there, and looking up, began to welcome his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) young friend
with frank hospitality.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, Mr Harding--pray don't let me disturb you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bold; <div class="bookquote">``you
know how fond I am of sacred music.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! it's nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>the precentor</b></font>)</div>said the precentor, shutting up the book and then
opening it again as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) saw the delightfully imploring look of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) old
friend Bunce. Oh, Bunce, Bunce, Bunce, I fear that after all thou art
but a flatterer. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll just finish it then; it's a favourite
little bit of Bishop's; and then, Mr Bold, we'll have a stroll and
a chat till Eleanor comes in and gives us tea.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And so Bold sat
down on the soft turf to listen, or rather to think how, after such
sweet harmony, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) might best introduce a theme of so much discord, to
disturb the peace of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) who was so ready to welcome him (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) kindly.

<p/>Bold thought that the performance was soon over, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) felt that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) had a somewhat difficult task, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) almost regretted the final
leave-taking of the last of the old men, slow as they were in going
through their adieux.

<p/>Bold's heart was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) mouth, as the precentor made some ordinary but
kind remark as to the friendliness of the visit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One evening call,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``is worth ten in the morning. It's all
formality in the morning; real social talk never begins till after
dinner. That's why I dine early, so as to get as much as I can of
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite true, Mr Harding,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div>said the other; <div class="bookquote">``but I fear I've reversed
the order of things, and I owe you much apology for troubling you on
business at such an hour; but it is on business that I have called
just now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Harding looked blank and annoyed; there was something in the
tone of the young man's voice which told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) that the interview was
intended to be disagreeable, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) shrank back at finding his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) kindly
greeting so repulsed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to speak to you about the hospital,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued Bold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, anything I can tell you I shall be most happy--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's about the accounts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, my dear fellow, I can tell you nothing, for I'm as ignorant
as a child. All I know is, that they pay me #800 a year. Go to
Chadwick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) knows all about the accounts; and now tell me, will poor
Mary Jones ever get the use of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) limb again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) will, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'s careful; but, Mr Harding, I hope
you won't object to discuss with me what I have to say about the
hospital.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Harding gave a deep, long-drawn sigh. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) did object, very strongly
object, to discuss any such subject with John Bold; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) had not the
business tact of Mr Chadwick, and did not know how to relieve himself
from the coming evil; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) sighed sadly, but made no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have the greatest regard for you, Mr Harding,''  (<font color='red'><b>the precentor</b></font>)</div>continued Bold; <div class="bookquote">``the
truest respect, the most sincere--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the precentor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank ye, thank ye, Mr Bold,''  (<font color='red'><b>the precentor</b></font>)</div>interjaculated the precentor somewhat
impatiently; <div class="bookquote">``I'm much obliged, but never mind that; I'm as likely to
be in the wrong as another man,--quite as likely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the precentor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Mr Harding, I must express what I feel, lest you should think
there is personal enmity in what I'm going to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Personal enmity! Going to do! Why, you're not going to cut my
throat, nor put me into the Ecclesiastical Court!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Bold tried to laugh, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) couldn't. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) was quite in earnest, and
determined in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) course, and couldn't make a joke of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) walked
on awhile in silence before he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) recommenced his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) attack, during which
Mr Harding, who had still the bow in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) hand, played rapidly on an
imaginary violoncello. <div class="bookquote">``I fear there is reason to think that John
Hiram's will is not carried out to the letter, Mr Harding,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the
young man at last; <div class="bookquote">``and I have been asked to see into it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, I've no objection on earth; and now we need not say
another word about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only one word more, Mr Harding. Chadwick has referred me to Cox and
Cummins, and I think it my duty to apply to them for some statement
about the hospital. In what I do I may appear to be interfering with
you, and I hope you will forgive me for doing so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Bold,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other, stopping, and speaking with some solemnity,
<div class="bookquote">``if you act justly, say nothing in this matter but the truth, and use
no unfair weapons in carrying out your purposes, I shall have nothing
to forgive. I presume you think I am not entitled to the income
I receive from the hospital, and that others are entitled to it.
Whatever some may do, I shall never attribute to you base motives
because you hold an opinion opposed to my own and adverse to my
interests: pray do what you consider to be your duty; I can give
you no assistance, neither will I offer you any obstacle. Let me,
however, suggest to you, that you can in no wise forward your views
nor I mine, by any discussion between us. Here comes Eleanor and the
ponies, and we'll go in to tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Bold, however, felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not sit down at ease with Mr Harding
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) daughter after what had passed, and therefore excused himself
with much awkward apology; and merely raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) hat and bowing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
passed Eleanor and the pony chair, left her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) in disappointed amazement
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) departure.

<p/>Mr Harding's demeanour certainly impressed Bold with a full conviction
that the warden felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) stood on strong grounds, and almost made
him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) think that he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) was about to interfere without due warrant in the
private affairs of a just and honourable man; but Mr Harding himself
was anything but satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) own view of the case.

<p/>In the first place, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) wished for Eleanor's sake to think well of
Bold and to like him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) could not but feel disgusted at the
arrogance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) conduct. What right had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) to say that John Hiram's
will was not fairly carried out? But then the question would arise
within his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) heart,--Was that will fairly acted on? Did John Hiram mean
that the warden of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) hospital should receive considerably more out
of the legacy than all the twelve old men together for whose behoof
the hospital was built? Could it be possible that John Bold was
right, and that the reverend warden of the hospital had been for the
last ten years and more the unjust recipient of an income legally and
equitably belonging to others? What if it should be proved before
the light of day that he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>), whose life had been so happy, so quiet,
so respected, had absorbed eight thousand pounds to which he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had no
title, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) could never repay? I do not say that he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) feared
that such was really the case; but the first shade of doubt now fell
across his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) mind, and from this evening, for many a long, long day,
our good, kind loving warden was neither happy nor at ease.

<p/>Thoughts of this kind, these first moments of much misery, oppressed
Mr Harding as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) sat sipping his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) tea, absent and ill at ease. Poor
Eleanor felt that all was not right, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) ideas as to the cause of
the evening's discomfort did not go beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) lover, and his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) sudden
and uncivil departure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) thought there must have been some quarrel
between Bold and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was half angry with both, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) did not attempt to explain to herself why she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was so.

<p/>Mr Harding thought long and deeply over these things, both before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
went to bed and after it, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) lay awake, questioning within himself
the validity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) claim to the income which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) enjoyed. It seemed
clear at any rate that, however unfortunate he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) might be at having been
placed in such a position, no one could say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) ought either to
have refused the appointment first, or to have rejected the income
afterwards. All the world,--meaning the ecclesiastical world as
confined to the English church,--knew that the wardenship of the
Barchester Hospital was a snug sinecure, but no one had ever been
blamed for accepting it. To how much blame, however, would he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) have
been open had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) rejected it! How mad would he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) have been thought had
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) declared, when the situation was vacant and offered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
had scruples as to receiving #800 a year from John Hiram's property,
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) had rather some stranger should possess it! How would Dr
Grantly have shaken his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) wise head, and have consulted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) friends
in the close as to some decent retreat for the coming insanity of the
poor minor canon! If he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) was right in accepting the place, it was
clear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) also that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) would be wrong in rejecting any part of the
income attached to it. The patronage was a valuable appanage of the
bishopric; and surely it would not be his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) duty to lessen the value
of that preferment which had been bestowed on himself; surely he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) was
bound to stand by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) order.

<p/>But somehow these arguments, though they seemed logical, were not
satisfactory. Was John Hiram's will fairly carried out? that was the
true question: and if not, was it not his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) especial duty to see that
this was done,--his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) especial duty, whatever injury it might do to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) order,--however ill such duty might be received by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) patron and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) friends? At the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) friends, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) mind turned unhappily
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) son-in-law. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) knew well how strongly he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) would be supported
by Dr Grantly, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) could bring himself to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) case into the
archdeacon's hands and to allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) to fight the battle; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) knew
also that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) would find no sympathy there for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) doubts, no friendly
feeling, no inward comfort. Dr Grantly would be ready enough to take
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) cudgel against all comers on behalf of the church militant,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) would do so on the distasteful ground of the church's
infallibility. Such a contest would give no comfort to Mr Harding's
doubts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was not so anxious to prove himself right, as to be so.

<p/>I have said before that Dr Grantly was the working man of the diocese,
and that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father the bishop was somewhat inclined to an idle life.
So it was; but the bishop, though he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) had never been an active man, was
one whose qualities had rendered him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) dear to all who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
was the very opposite to his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) son; he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was a bland and a kind old man,
opposed by every feeling to authoritative demonstrations and episcopal
ostentation. It was perhaps well for him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) situation, that his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
son had early in life been able to do that which he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) could not well do
when he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was younger, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) could not have done at all now that
he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was over seventy. The bishop knew how to entertain the clergy
of his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) diocese, to talk easy small-talk with the rectors' wives,
and put curates at their ease; but it required the strong hand of
the archdeacon to deal with such as were refractory either in their
doctrines or their lives.

<p/>The bishop and Mr Harding loved each other warmly. They had grown old
together, and had together spent many, many years in clerical pursuits
and clerical conversation. When one of them was a bishop and the
other only a minor canon they were even then much together; but since
their children had married, and Mr Harding had become warden and
precentor, they were all in all to each other. I will not say that
they managed the diocese between them, but they spent much time in
discussing the man who did, and in forming little plans to mitigate
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrath against church delinquents, and soften his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) aspirations for
church dominion.

<p/>Mr Harding determined to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) mind and confess his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) doubts to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) old friend; and to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) went on the morning after John Bold's
uncourteous visit.

<p/>Up to this period no rumour of these cruel proceedings against the
hospital had reached the bishop's ears. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) had doubtless heard that
men existed who questioned his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) right to present to a sinecure of #800
a year, as he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) had heard from time to time of some special immorality
or disgraceful disturbance in the usually decent and quiet city of
Barchester: but all he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) did, and all he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was called on to do, on such
occasions, was to shake his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) head, and to beg his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) son, the great
dictator, to see that no harm happened to the church.

<p/>It was a long story that Mr Harding had to tell before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) made the
bishop comprehend his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) own view of the case; but we need not follow
him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) through the tale. At first the bishop counselled but one step,
recommended but one remedy, had but one medicine in his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) whole
pharmacopoeia strong enough to touch so grave a disorder;--he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
prescribed the archdeacon. <div class="bookquote">``Refer him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to the archdeacon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
repeated, as Mr Harding spoke of Bold and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) visit. <div class="bookquote">``The archdeacon
will set you quite right about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) kindly said, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) friend
spoke with hesitation of the justness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) cause. <div class="bookquote">``No man has got
up all that so well as the archdeacon;''  (<font color='red'><b>the patient</b></font>)</div>but the dose, though large,
failed to quiet the patient; indeed it almost produced nausea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, bishop,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``did you ever read John Hiram's will?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The bishop thought probably he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) had, thirty-five years ago, when
first instituted to his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) see, but could not state positively: however,
he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) very well knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) had the absolute right to present to the
wardenship, and that the income of the warden had been regularly
settled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, bishop, the question is, who has the power to settle it?
If, as this young man says, the will provides that the proceeds of
the property are to be divided into shares, who has the power to
alter these provisions?''  (<font color='red'><b>The bishop</b></font>)</div>The bishop had an indistinct idea that
they altered themselves by the lapse of years; that a kind of
ecclesiastical statute of limitation barred the rights of the twelve
bedesmen to any increase of income arising from the increased value of
property. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) said something about tradition; more of the many learned
men who by their practice had confirmed the present arrangement;
then went at some length into the propriety of maintaining the due
difference in rank and income between a beneficed clergyman and
certain poor old men who were dependent on charity; and concluded his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
argument by another reference to the archdeacon.

<p/>The precentor sat thoughtfully gazing at the fire, and listening to
the good-natured reasoning of his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) friend. What the bishop said had a
sort of comfort in it, but it was not a sustaining comfort. It made
Mr Harding feel that many others,--indeed, all others of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) own
order,--would think him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) right; but it failed to prove to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
truly was so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bishop,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), at last, after both had sat silent for a while, <div class="bookquote">``I
should deceive you and myself too, if I did not tell you that I am
very unhappy about this. Suppose that I cannot bring myself to agree
with Dr Grantly!--that I find, after inquiry, that the young man is
right, and that I am wrong,--what then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The two old men were sitting near each other,--so near that the bishop
was able to lay his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) hand upon the other's knee, and he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) did so with a
gentle pressure. Mr Harding well knew what that pressure meant. The
bishop had no further argument to adduce; he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) could not fight for the
cause as his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) son would do; he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) could not prove all the precentor's
doubts to be groundless; but he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) could sympathise with his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) friend, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) did so; and Mr Harding felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had received that for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
came. There was another period of silence, after which the bishop
asked, with a degree of irritable energy, very unusual with him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>),
whether this <div class="bookquote">``pestilent intruder''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>-LRB-meaning John Bold-RRB- had any friends
in Barchester.

<p/>Mr Harding had fully made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) mind to tell the bishop everything;
to speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) daughter's love, as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) own troubles; to talk
of John Bold in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) double capacity of future son-in-law and present
enemy; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) felt it to be sufficiently disagreeable, now was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) time to do it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>intruder</b></font>) is very intimate at my own house, bishop.''  (<font color='red'><b>The bishop</b></font>)</div>The bishop stared. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
was not so far gone in orthodoxy and church militancy as his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) son, but
still he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) could not bring himself to understand how so declared an
enemy of the establishment could be admitted on terms of intimacy into
the house, not only of so firm a pillar as Mr Harding, but one so much
injured as the warden of the hospital.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, I like Mr Bold much, personally,''  (<font color='red'><b>the victim</b></font>)</div>continued the disinterested
victim; <div class="bookquote">``and to tell you the `truth,''' (<font color='red'><b>the victim</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) hesitated as he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) brought out
the dreadful tidings,--<div class="bookquote">``I have sometimes thought it not improbable
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) would be my second son-in-law.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The bishop did not whistle:
we believe that they lose the power of doing so on being consecrated;
and that in these days one might as easily meet a corrupt judge as a
whistling bishop; but he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) would have done so, but
for his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) apron.

<p/>What a brother-in-law for the archdeacon! what an alliance for
Barchester close! what a connection for even the episcopal palace!
The bishop, in his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) simple mind, felt no doubt that John Bold, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>)
so much power, would shut up all cathedrals, and probably all parish
churches; distribute all tithes among Methodists, Baptists, and other
savage tribes; utterly annihilate the sacred bench, and make shovel
hats and lawn sleeves as illegal as cowls, sandals, and sackcloth!
Here was a nice man to be initiated into the comfortable arcana of
ecclesiastical snuggeries; one who doubted the integrity of parsons,
and probably disbelieved the Trinity!

<p/>Mr Harding saw what an effect his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) communication had made, and almost
repented the openness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) disclosure; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), however, did what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
could to moderate the grief of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) friend and patron. <div class="bookquote">``I do not say
that there is any engagement between them. Had there been, Eleanor
would have told me; I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) well enough to be assured that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
would have done so; but I see that they are fond of each other; and
as a man and a father, I have had no objection to urge against their
intimacy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Mr Harding,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bishop</b></font>)</div>said the bishop, <div class="bookquote">``how are you to oppose him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
is your son-in-law?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the bishop</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean to oppose him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>); it is he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) who opposes me; if anything is
to be done in defence, I suppose Chadwick will do it. I suppose--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the archdeacon will see to that: were the young man twice his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
brother-in-law, the archdeacon will never be deterred from doing what
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feels to be right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Harding reminded the bishop that the archdeacon and the reformer
were not yet brothers, and very probably never would be; exacted from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) a promise that Eleanor's name should not be mentioned in any
discussion between the father bishop and son archdeacon respecting the
hospital; and then took his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) departure, leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) poor old friend
bewildered, amazed, and confounded.




<p/>Chapter IV

<p/>HIRAM``S BEDESMEN


<p/>The parties most interested in the movement which is about to set
Barchester by the ears were not the foremost to discuss the merit
of the question, as is often the case; but when the bishop, the
archdeacon, the warden, the steward, and Messrs Cox and Cummins,
were all busy with the matter, each in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cummins</b></font>) own way, it is not to be
supposed that Hiram's bedesmen themselves were altogether passive
spectators. Finney, the attorney, had been among them, asking sly
questions, and raising immoderate hopes, creating a party hostile
to the warden, and establishing a corps in the enemy's camp, as he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
figuratively calls it to himself. Poor old men: whoever may be
righted or wronged by this inquiry, they at any rate will assuredly
be only injured: to them it can only be an unmixed evil. How can
their lot be improved? all their wants are supplied; every comfort is
administered; they have warm houses, good clothes, plentiful diet,
and rest after a life of labour; and above all, that treasure so
inestimable in declining years, a true and kind friend to listen to
their sorrows, watch over their sickness, and administer comfort as
regards this world, and the world to come!

<p/>John Bold sometimes thinks of this, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) is talking loudly of the
rights of the bedesmen, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) has taken under his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) protection; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>)
quiets the suggestion within his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) breast with the high-sounding name
of justice: <div class="bookquote">''_Fiat justitia, ruat coelum_.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>These old men should,
by rights, have one hundred pounds a year instead of one shilling
and sixpence a day, and the warden should have two hundred or three
hundred pounds instead of eight hundred pounds. What is unjust must
be wrong; what is wrong should be righted; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) declined the
task, who else would do it?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Each one of you is clearly entitled to one hundred pounds a year by
common law'' (<font color='red'><b>Finney/Mr Finney</b></font>)</div>: such had been the important whisper made by Finney into
the ears of Abel Handy, and by him (<font color='blue'><b>Handy</b></font>) retailed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Handy</b></font>) eleven brethren.

<p/>Too much must not be expected from the flesh and blood even of John
Hiram's bedesmen, and the positive promise of one hundred a year to
each of the twelve old men had its way with most of them. The great
Bunce was not to be wiled away, and was upheld in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) orthodoxy by
two adherents. Abel Handy, who was the leader of the aspirants after
wealth, had, alas, a stronger following. No less than five of the
twelve soon believed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Handy</b></font>) views were just, making with their
leader a moiety of the hospital. The other three, volatile unstable
minds, vacillated between the two chieftains, now led away by the hope
of gold, now anxious to propitiate the powers that still existed.

<p/>It had been proposed to address a petition to the bishop as visitor,
praying his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) lordship to see justice done to the legal recipients of
John Hiram's Charity, and to send copies of this petition and of the
reply it would elicit to all the leading London papers, and thereby
to obtain notoriety for the subject. This it was thought would pave
the way for ulterior legal proceedings. It would have been a great
thing to have had the signatures and marks of all the twelve injured
legatees; but this was impossible: Bunce would have cut his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) hand off
sooner than have signed it. It was then suggested by Finney that
if even eleven could be induced to sanction the document, the one
obstinate recusant might have been represented as unfit to judge on
such a question,--in fact, as being _non compos mentis_,--and the
petition would have been taken as representing the feeling of the men.
But this could not be done: Bunce's friends were as firm as himself,
and as yet only six crosses adorned the document. It was the more
provoking, as Bunce himself could write his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) name legibly, and one of
those three doubting souls had for years boasted of like power, and
possessed, indeed, a Bible, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) was proud to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) name
written by himself some thirty years ago--<div class="bookquote">``Job Skulpit;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but it was
thought that Job Skulpit, having forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) scholarship, on that
account recoiled from the petition, and that the other doubters would
follow as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) led them. A petition signed by half the hospital would
have but a poor effect.

<p/>It was in Skulpit's room that the petition was now lying, waiting such
additional signatures as Abel Handy, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Handy</b></font>) eloquence, could obtain
for it. The six marks it bore were duly attested, thus:


<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Handy</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Handy</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Handy</b></font>)
Abel X Handy, Gregy X Moody, Mathew X Spriggs,
mark mark mark


<p/>&c., and places were duly designated in pencil for those brethren who
were now expected to join: for Skulpit alone was left a spot on which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mathew</b></font>) genuine signature might be written in fair clerk-like style.
Handy had brought in the document, and spread it out on the small deal
table, and was now standing by it persuasive and eager. Moody had
followed with an inkhorn, carefully left behind by Finney; and Spriggs
bore aloft, as though it were a sword, a well-worn ink-black pen,
which from time to time he (<font color='blue'><b>Spriggs</b></font>) endeavoured to thrust into Skulpit's
unwilling hand.

<p/>With the learned man were his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) two abettors in indecision, William Gazy
and Jonathan Crumple. If ever the petition were to be forwarded, now
was the time,--so said Mr Finney; and great was the anxiety on the
part of those whose one hundred pounds a year, as they believed,
mainly depended on the document in question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be kept out of all that money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Moody</b></font>)</div>as the avaricious Moody had
muttered to his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) friend Handy, <div class="bookquote">``by an old fool saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) can
write his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) own name like his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) betters!''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend Handy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Job,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Handy, trying to impart to his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) own sour,
ill-omened visage a smile of approbation, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) greatly
failed; <div class="bookquote">``so you're ready now, Mr Finney says; here's the
place, d'ye see;'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) huge brown finger down on
the dirty paper;--<div class="bookquote">``name or mark, it's all one. Come along,
old boy; if so be we're to have the spending of this money,
why the sooner the better,--that's my maxim.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Moody</b></font>)</div>said Moody. <div class="bookquote">``We a'n't none of us so young; we can't
stay waiting for old Catgut no longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>these miscreants</b></font>)</div><p/>It was thus these miscreants named our excellent friend. The nickname
he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) could easily have forgiven, but the allusion to the divine source
of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) melodious joy would have irritated even him (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>). Let us hope
he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) never knew the insult.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only think, old Billy Gazy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Spriggs</b></font>)</div>said Spriggs, who rejoiced in greater
youth than his (<font color='blue'><b>Spriggs</b></font>) brethren, but having fallen into a fire when drunk, had
had one eye burnt out, one cheek burnt through, and one arm nearly
burnt off, and who, therefore, in regard to personal appearance, was
not the most prepossessing of men, <div class="bookquote">``a hundred a year, and all to
spend; only think, old Billy Gazy;''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Spriggs</b></font>) gave a hideous grin that
showed off his (<font color='blue'><b>Spriggs</b></font>) misfortunes to their full extent.

<p/>Old Billy Gazy was not alive to much enthusiasm. Even these golden
prospects did not arouse him (<font color='blue'><b>Gazy</b></font>) to do more than rub his (<font color='blue'><b>Gazy</b></font>) poor old bleared
eyes with the cuff of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gazy</b></font>) bedesman's gown, and gently mutter: <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Gazy</b></font>)
didn't know, not he (<font color='blue'><b>Gazy</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Gazy</b></font>) didn't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you'd know, Jonathan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Spriggs</b></font>)</div>continued Spriggs, turning to the other
friend of Skulpit's, who was sitting on a stool by the table, gazing
vacantly at the petition. Jonathan Crumple was a meek, mild man, who
had known better days; his (<font color='blue'><b>Crumple</b></font>) means had been wasted by bad children,
who had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Crumple</b></font>) life wretched till he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumple</b></font>) had been received into the
hospital, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumple</b></font>) had not long been a member. Since that day he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumple</b></font>)
had known neither sorrow nor trouble, and this attempt to fill him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumple</b></font>)
with new hopes was, indeed, a cruelty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A hundred a year's a nice thing, for sartain, neighbour Spriggs,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumple</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I once had nigh to that myself, but it didn't do me no
good.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumple</b></font>) gave a low sigh, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumple</b></font>) thought of the children of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crumple</b></font>)
own loins who had robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumple</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And shall have again, Joe,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Handy; <div class="bookquote">``and will have someone to
keep it right and tight for you this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Crumple sighed again;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumple</b></font>) had learned the impotency of worldly wealth,
and would have been satisfied, if left untempted, to have remained
happy with one and sixpence a day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Skulpit,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeated Handy, getting impatient, <div class="bookquote">``you're not going
to go along with old Bunce in helping that parson to rob us all.
Take the pen, man, and right yourself. Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumple</b></font>) added, seeing that
Skulpit still doubted, <div class="bookquote">``to see a man as is afraid to stand by hisself
is, to my thinking, the meanest thing as is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Skulpit/Job Skulpit</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sink them all for parsons, says I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Moody</b></font>)</div>growled Moody; <div class="bookquote">``hungry beggars,
as never thinks their bellies full till they have robbed all and
everything!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Moody</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's to harm you, man?''  (<font color='red'><b>Spriggs</b></font>)</div>argued Spriggs. <div class="bookquote">``Let them look never so
black at you, they can't get you put out when you're once in;--no,
not old Catgut, with Calves to help him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I am sorry to say the
archdeacon himself was designated by this scurrilous allusion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Spriggs</b></font>)
nether person.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A hundred a year to win, and nothing to lose,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued Handy. <div class="bookquote">``My
eyes! Well, how a man's to doubt about sich a bit of cheese as that
passes me;--but some men is timorous;--some men is born with no pluck
in them;--some men is cowed at the very first sight of a gentleman's
coat and waistcoat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, Mr Harding, if you had but taken the archdeacon's advice in that
disputed case, when Joe Mutters was this ungrateful demagogue's rival
candidate!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Afraid of a parson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Moody</b></font>)</div>growled Moody, with a look of ineffable scorn.
<div class="bookquote">``I tell ye what I'd be afraid of--I'd be afraid of not getting nothing
from 'em but just what I could take by might and right;--that's the
most I'd be afraid on of any parson of 'em all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Skulpit/Job Skulpit</b></font>)</div>said Skulpit, apologetically, <div class="bookquote">``Mr Harding's not so bad;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) did
give us twopence a day, didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Skulpit/Job Skulpit</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Twopence a day!''  (<font color='red'><b>Spriggs</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Spriggs with scorn, opening awfully the
red cavern of his (<font color='blue'><b>Spriggs</b></font>) lost eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Twopence a day!''  (<font color='red'><b>Moody</b></font>)</div>muttered Moody with a curse; <div class="bookquote">``sink his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) twopence!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Moody</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Twopence a day!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Handy; <div class="bookquote">``and I'm to go, hat in hand, and
thank a chap for twopence a day, when he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) owes me a hundred pounds a
year; no, thank ye; that may do for you, but it won't for me. Come,
I say, Skulpit, are you a going to put your mark to this here paper,
or are you not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div><p/>Skulpit looked round in wretched indecision to his (<font color='blue'><b>Spriggs</b></font>) two friends. <div class="bookquote">``What
d'ye think, Bill Gazy?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Spriggs</b></font>).

<p/>But Bill Gazy couldn't think. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gazy</b></font>) made a noise like the bleating of an
old sheep, which was intended to express the agony of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gazy</b></font>) doubt, and
again muttered that <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Gazy</b></font>) didn't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take hold, you old cripple,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy Gazy/Billy</b></font>)</div>said Handy, thrusting the pen into poor
Billy's hand: <div class="bookquote">``there, so--ugh! you old fool, you've been and smeared
it all,--there,--that'll do for you;--that's as good as the best
name as ever was written'' (<font color='red'><b>Billy Gazy/Billy</b></font>)</div>: and a big blotch of ink was presumed to
represent Billy Gazy's acquiescence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Jonathan,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Handy, turning to Crumple.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A hundred a year's a nice thing, for sartain,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>again argued Crumple.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, neighbour Skulpit, how's it to be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, please yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Skulpit: <div class="bookquote">``please yourself, and you'll
please me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jonathan Crumple/Jonathan</b></font>)</div><p/>The pen was thrust into Crumple's hand, and a faint, wandering,
meaningless sign was made, betokening such sanction and authority as
Jonathan Crumple was able to convey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Job,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Handy, softened by success, <div class="bookquote">``don't let 'em have to
say that old Bunce has a man like you under his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) thumb,--a man that
always holds his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) head in the hospital as high as Bunce himself, though
you're never axed to drink wine, and sneak, and tell lies about your
betters as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Skulpit held the pen, and made little flourishes with it in the air,
but still hesitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And if you'll be said by me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued Handy, <div class="bookquote">``you'll not write your
name to it at all, but just put your mark like the others;'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--the cloud
began to clear from Skulpit's brow;--<div class="bookquote">``we all know you can do it if you
like, but maybe you wouldn't like to seem uppish, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, the mark would be best,''  (<font color='red'><b>Skulpit/Job Skulpit</b></font>)</div>said Skulpit. <div class="bookquote">``One name and the rest
marks wouldn't look well, would it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The worst in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>said Handy; <div class="bookquote">``there--there'' (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>: and stooping
over the petition, the learned clerk made a huge cross on the place
left for his (<font color='blue'><b>Crumple</b></font>) signature.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the game,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Handy, triumphantly pocketing the petition;
<div class="bookquote">``we're all in a boat now, that is, the nine of us; and as for old
Bunce, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) cronies, they may--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumple</b></font>) was hobbling off to the
door, with a crutch on one side and a stick on the other, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumple</b></font>) was met
by Bunce himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well Handy, and what may old Bunce do?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the gray-haired, upright
senior.

<p/>Handy muttered something, and was departing; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) was stopped in the
doorway by the huge frame of the newcomer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've been doing no good here, Abel Handy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">''`tis plain to
see that; and `tisn't much good, I'm thinking, you ever do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mind my own business, Master Bunce,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>muttered the other, <div class="bookquote">``and do
you do the same. It ain't nothing to you what I does;--and your
spying and poking here won't do no good nor yet no harm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose then, Job,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bunce/Mr Bunce</b></font>)</div>continued Bunce, not noticing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) opponent, <div class="bookquote">``if
the truth must out, you've stuck your name to that petition of theirs
at last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>opponent</b></font>)</div><p/>Skulpit looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) were about to sink into the ground with
shame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it to you what he (<font color='blue'><b>Handy</b></font>) signs?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Handy. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose if we all
wants to ax for our own, we needn't ax leave of you first, Mr Bunce,
big a man as you are; and as to your sneaking in here, into Job's room
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>)'s busy, and where you're not wanted--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bunce/Mr Bunce</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've knowed Job Skulpit, man and boy, sixty years,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bunce/Mr Bunce</b></font>)</div>said Bunce,
looking at the man of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) spoke, <div class="bookquote">``and that's ever since the day
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was born. I knowed the mother that bore him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and I were
little wee things, picking daisies together in the close yonder; and
I've lived under the same roof with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) more nor ten years; and after
that I may come into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) room without axing leave, and yet no sneaking
neither.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you can, Mr Bunce,''  (<font color='red'><b>Skulpit/Job Skulpit</b></font>)</div>said Skulpit; <div class="bookquote">``so you can, any hour, day or
night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Skulpit/Job Skulpit</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'm free also to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) my mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bunce/Mr Bunce</b></font>)</div>continued Bunce, looking at
the one man and addressing the other; <div class="bookquote">``and I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>)'s
done a foolish and a wrong thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>)'s turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) back upon one
who is his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) best friend; and is playing the game of others, who care
nothing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>), whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) be poor or rich, well or ill, alive or
dead. A hundred a year? Are the lot of you soft enough to think that
if a hundred a year be to be given, it's the likes of you that will
get it?'' (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) pointed to Billy Gazy, Spriggs, and Crumple. <div class="bookquote">``Did
any of us ever do anything worth half the money? Was it to make
gentlemen of us we were brought in here, when all the world turned
against us, and we couldn't longer earn our daily bread? A'n't you
all as rich in your ways as he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?'' (<font color='red'><b>the orator</b></font>)</div>--and the orator pointed to
the side on which the warden lived. <div class="bookquote">``A'n't you getting all you hoped
for, ay, and more than you hoped for? Wouldn't each of you have given
the dearest limb of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) body to secure that which now makes you so
unthankful?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We wants what John Hiram left us,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Handy. <div class="bookquote">``We wants what's ourn

be ourn, and by goles we'll have it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Law!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bunce/Mr Bunce</b></font>)</div>said Bunce, with all the scorn he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) knew how to command--<div class="bookquote">``law!
Did ye ever know a poor man yet was the better for law, or for a
lawyer? Will Mr Finney ever be as good to you, Job, as that man has
been? Will he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) see to you when you're sick, and comfort you when
you're wretched? Will he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, nor give you port wine, old boy, on cold winter nights! he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) won't
do that, will he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Handy; and laughing at the severity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>)
own wit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) colleagues retired, carrying with them, however,
the now powerful petition.

<p/>There is no help for spilt milk; and Mr Bunce could only retire to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) own room, disgusted at the frailty of human nature. Job Skulpit
scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) head;--Jonathan Crumple again remarked, that, <div class="bookquote">``for
sartain, sure a hundred a year was very nice;'' (<font color='red'><b>Jonathan Crumple/Jonathan</b></font>)</div>--and Billy Gazy again
rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gazy</b></font>) eyes, and lowly muttered that <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) didn't know.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Billy Gazy/Billy</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter V

<p/>DR GRANTLY VISITS THE HOSPITAL


<p/>Though doubt and hesitation disturbed the rest of our poor warden, no
such weakness perplexed the nobler breast of his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) son-in-law. As the
indomitable cock preparing for the combat sharpens his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) spurs, shakes
his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) feathers, and erects his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) comb, so did the archdeacon arrange his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
weapons for the coming war, without misgiving and without fear. That
he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) was fully confident of the justice of his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) cause let no one doubt.
Many a man can fight his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) battle with good courage, but with a doubting
conscience. Such was not the case with Dr Grantly. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not
believe in the Gospel with more assurance than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did in the sacred
justice of all ecclesiastical revenues. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder to
the wheel to defend the income of the present and future precentors
of Barchester, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was animated by as strong a sense of a holy cause,
as that which gives courage to a missionary in Africa, or enables a
sister of mercy to give up the pleasures of the world for the wards
of a hospital. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was about to defend the holy of holies from the
touch of the profane; to guard the citadel of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) church from the
most rampant of its enemies; to put on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) good armour in the best of
fights, and secure, if possible, the comforts of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) creed for coming
generations of ecclesiastical dignitaries. Such a work required no
ordinary vigour; and the archdeacon was, therefore, extraordinarily
vigorous. It demanded a buoyant courage, and a heart happy in its
toil; and the archdeacon's heart was happy, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) courage was
buoyant.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not be able to animate his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father-in-law
with feelings like his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own, but this did not much disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
preferred to bear the brunt of the battle alone, and did not doubt
that the warden would resign himself into his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) hands with passive
submission.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mr Chadwick,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) said, walking into the steward's office a day
or two after the signing of the petition as commemorated in the last
chapter: <div class="bookquote">``anything from Cox and Cummins this morning?''  (<font color='red'><b>the steward</b></font>)</div>Mr Chadwick
handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) a letter; which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) read, stroking the tight-gaitered calf
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) right leg as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) did so. Messrs Cox and Cummins merely said
that they had as yet received no notice from their adversaries;
that they could recommend no preliminary steps; but that should any
proceeding really be taken by the bedesmen, it would be expedient to
consult that very eminent Queen's Counsel, Sir Abraham Haphazard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite agree with them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr Grantly</b></font>)</div>said Dr Grantly, refolding the letter.
<div class="bookquote">``I perfectly agree with them. Haphazard is no doubt the best man; a
thorough churchman, a sound conservative, and in every respect the
best man we could get;--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s in the House, too, which is a great
thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Chadwick/Chadwick</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Chadwick quite agreed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You remember how completely he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put down that scoundrel Horseman about
the Bishop of Beverley's income; how completely he (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) set them all adrift
in the earl's case.''  (<font color='red'><b>St Cross</b></font>)</div>Since the question of St Cross had been mooted
by the public, one noble lord had become <div class="bookquote">``the earl,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>_par excellence_,
in the doctor's estimation. <div class="bookquote">``How he (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) silenced that fellow at
Rochester. Of course we must have Haphazard; and I'll tell you what,
Mr Chadwick, we must take care to be in time, or the other party will
forestall us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Abraham/Abraham Haphazard/ABRAHAM</b></font>)</div><p/>With all his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) admiration for Sir Abraham, the doctor seemed to think
it not impossible that that great man might be induced to lend his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
gigantic powers to the side of the church's enemies.

<p/>Having settled this point to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) satisfaction, the doctor stepped down
to the hospital, to learn how matters were going on there; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
walked across the hallowed close, and looked up at the ravens who
cawed with a peculiar reverence as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wended his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought with
increased acerbity of those whose impiety would venture to disturb the
goodly grace of cathedral institutions.

<p/>And who has not felt the same? We believe that Mr Horseman himself
would relent, and the spirit of Sir Benjamin Hall give way, were those
great reformers to allow themselves to stroll by moonlight round the
towers of some of our ancient churches. Who would not feel charity
for a prebendary when walking the quiet length of that long aisle at
Winchester, looking at those decent houses, that trim grass-plat, and
feeling, as one must, the solemn, orderly comfort of the spot! Who
could be hard upon a dean while wandering round the sweet close of
Hereford, and owning that in that precinct, tone and colour, design
and form, solemn tower and storied window, are all in unison, and all
perfect! Who could lie basking in the cloisters of Salisbury, and
gaze on Jewel's library and that unequalled spire, without feeling
that bishops should sometimes be rich!

<p/>The tone of our archdeacon's mind must not astonish us; it has been
the growth of centuries of church ascendancy; and though some fungi
now disfigure the tree, though there be much dead wood, for how much
good fruit have not we to be thankful? Who, without remorse, can
batter down the dead branches of an old oak, now useless, but, ah!
still so beautiful, or drag out the fragments of the ancient forest,
without feeling that they sheltered the younger plants, to which they
are now summoned to give way in a tone so peremptory and so harsh?

<p/>The archdeacon, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) virtues, was not a man of delicate
feeling; and after having made his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) morning salutations in the warden's
drawing-room, he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) did not scruple to commence an attack on <div class="bookquote">``pestilent''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>John Bold in the presence of Miss Harding, though he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) rightly guessed
that that lady was not indifferent to the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) enemy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nelly, my dear, fetch me my spectacles from the back room,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
father, anxious to save both her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) blushes and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) feelings.

<p/>Eleanor brought the spectacles, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father was trying, in
ambiguous phrases, to explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) too-practical brother-in-law that
it might be as well not to say anything about Bold before her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), and
then retreated. Nothing had been explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) about Bold and the
hospital; but, with a woman's instinct she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) knew that things were going
wrong.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must soon be doing something,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>commenced the archdeacon, wiping
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) brows with a large, bright-coloured handkerchief, for he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) had felt
busy, and had walked quick, and it was a broiling summer's day. <div class="bookquote">``Of
course you have heard of the petition?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Harding owned, somewhat unwillingly, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had heard of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!'' (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>--the archdeacon looked for some expressions of opinion, but
none coming, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) continued,--<div class="bookquote">``We must be doing something, you know; we
mustn't allow these people to cut the ground from under us while we
sit looking on.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The archdeacon, who was a practical man, allowed
himself the use of everyday expressive modes of speech when among his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
closest intimates, though no one could soar into a more intricate
labyrinth of refined phraseology when the church was the subject, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lower brethren were his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) auditors.

<p/>The warden still looked mutely in his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) face, making the slightest
possible passes with an imaginary fiddle bow, and stopping, as he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
did so, sundry imaginary strings with the fingers of his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) other hand.
``Twas his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) constant consolation in conversational troubles. While
these vexed him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) sorely, the passes would be short and slow, and the
upper hand would not be seen to work; nay, the strings on which it
operated would sometimes lie concealed in the musician's pocket, and
the instrument on which he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) played would be beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) chair;--but as
his (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) spirit warmed to the subject,--as his (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) trusting heart looking to
the bottom of that which vexed him (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>), would see its clear way out,--he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>)
would rise to a higher melody, sweep the unseen strings with a bolder
hand, and swiftly fingering the cords from his (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) neck, down along his (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>)
waistcoat, and up again to his (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) very ear, create an ecstatic strain of
perfect music, audible to himself and to St Cecilia, and not without
effect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite agree with Cox and Cummins,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>continued the archdeacon.
<div class="bookquote">``They say we must secure Sir Abraham Haphazard. I shall not have
the slightest fear in leaving the case in Sir Abraham's hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The warden</b></font>)</div><p/>The warden played the slowest and saddest of tunes. It was but a
dirge on one string.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think Sir Abraham will not be long in letting Master Bold know what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>)'s about. I fancy I hear Sir Abraham cross-questioning him (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) at the
Common Pleas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>warden</b></font>)</div><p/>The warden thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) income being thus discussed, his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) modest
life, his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) daily habits, and his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) easy work; and nothing issued from
that single cord, but a low wail of sorrow. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose they've sent
this petition up to my father.''  (<font color='red'><b>The warden</b></font>)</div>The warden didn't know; he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) imagined
they would do so this very day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I can't understand is, how you let them do it, with such a
command as you have in the place, or should have with such a man as
Bunce. I cannot understand why you let them do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do what?''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>asked the warden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, listen to this fellow Bold, and that other low pettifogger,
Finney;--and get up this petition too. Why didn't you tell Bunce to
destroy the petition?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would have been hardly wise,''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>said the warden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wise;--yes, it would have been very wise if they'd done it among
themselves. I must go up to the palace and answer it now, I suppose.
It's a very short answer they'll get, I can tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why shouldn't they petition, doctor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't they!''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>responded the archdeacon, in a loud brazen
voice, as though all the men in the hospital were expected to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
through the walls; <div class="bookquote">``why shouldn't they? I'll let them know why they
shouldn't; by the bye, warden, I'd like to say a few words to them all
together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The warden's mind misgave him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>), and even for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) forgot to
play. He (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) by no means wished to delegate to his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) son-in-law his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) place
and authority of warden; he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had expressly determined not to interfere
in any step which the men might wish to take in the matter under
dispute; he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) was most anxious neither to accuse them nor to defend
himself. All these things he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) was aware the archdeacon would do in his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
behalf, and that not in the mildest manner; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) knew not how to
refuse the permission requested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd so much sooner remain quiet in the matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>), in an
apologetic voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quiet!''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>said the archdeacon, still speaking with his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) brazen trumpet;
<div class="bookquote">``do you wish to be ruined in quiet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, if I am to be ruined, certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, warden; I tell you something must be done;--we must act;
just let me ring the bell, and send the men word that I'll speak to
them in the quad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Harding knew not how to resist, and the disagreeable order was
given. The quad, as it was familiarly called, was a small quadrangle,
open on one side to the river, and surrounded on the others by the
high wall of Mr Harding's garden, by one gable end of Mr Harding's
house, and by the end of the row of buildings which formed the
residences of the bedesmen. It was flagged all round, and the centre
was stoned; small stone gutters ran from the four corners of the
square to a grating in the centre; and attached to the end of Mr
Harding's house was a conduit with four cocks covered over from the
weather, at which the old men got their water, and very generally
performed their morning toilet. It was a quiet, sombre place, shaded
over by the trees of the warden's garden. On the side towards the
river, there stood a row of stone seats, on which the old men would
sit and gaze at the little fish, as they flitted by in the running
stream. On the other side of the river was a rich, green meadow,
running up to and joining the deanery, and as little open to the
public as the garden of the dean itself. Nothing, therefore, could be
more private than the quad of the hospital; and it was there that the
archdeacon determined to convey to them his (<font color='blue'><b>dean</b></font>) sense of their refractory
proceedings.

<p/>The servant soon brought in word that the men were assembled in the
quad, and the archdeacon, big with his (<font color='blue'><b>dean</b></font>) purpose, rose to address them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, warden, of course you're coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>dean</b></font>), seeing that Mr
Harding did not prepare to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you'd excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div>said Mr Harding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For heaven's sake, don't let us have division in the camp,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>replied
the archdeacon: <div class="bookquote">``let us have a long pull and a strong pull, but above
all a pull all together; come, warden, come; don't be afraid of your
duty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Harding was afraid; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was afraid that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was being led to do that
which was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) duty; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was not, however, strong enough to resist,
so he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) got up and followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) son-in-law.

<p/>The old men were assembled in groups in the quadrangle--eleven of them
at least, for poor old Johnny Bell was bed-ridden, and couldn't come;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) had, however, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) mark to the petition, as one of Handy's
earliest followers. ``Tis true he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) could not move from the bed where
he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) lay; `tis true he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had no friend on earth, but those whom the
hospital contained; and of those the warden and his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) daughter were
the most constant and most appreciated; `tis true that everything was
administered to him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) which his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) failing body could require, or which his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
faint appetite could enjoy; but still his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) dull eye had glistened for a
moment at the idea of possessing a hundred pounds a year <div class="bookquote">``to his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) own
cheek,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>as Abel Handy had eloquently expressed it; and poor old Johnny
Bell had greedily put his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) mark to the petition.

<p/>When the two clergymen appeared, they all uncovered their heads.
Handy was slow to do it, and hesitated; but the black coat and
waistcoat of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) had spoken so irreverently in Skulpit's room,
had its effect even on him (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) too doffed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) hat. Bunce,
advancing before the others, bowed lowly to the archdeacon, and with
affectionate reverence expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) wish, that the warden and Miss
Eleanor were quite well; <div class="bookquote">``and the doctor's lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Eleanor</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) added, turning
to the archdeacon, <div class="bookquote">``and the children at Plumstead, and my lord;''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>and
having made his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) speech, he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) also retired among the others, and took
his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) place with the rest upon the stone benches.

<p/>As the archdeacon stood up to make his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) speech, erect in the middle of
that little square, he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) looked like an ecclesiastical statue placed
there, as a fitting impersonation of the church militant here on
earth; his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) shovel hat, large, new, and well-pronounced, a churchman's
hat in every inch, declared the profession as plainly as does the
Quaker's broad brim; his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) heavy eyebrows, large open eyes, and full
mouth and chin expressed the solidity of his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) order; the broad chest,
amply covered with fine cloth, told how well to do was its estate; one
hand ensconced within his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) pocket, evinced the practical hold which our
mother church keeps on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) temporal possessions; and the other, loose
for action, was ready to fight if need be in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) defence; and, below
these, the decorous breeches, and neat black gaiters showing so
admirably that well-turned leg, betokened the decency, the outward
beauty and grace of our church establishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, my men,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) began, when he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had settled himself well in his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
position, <div class="bookquote">``I want to say a few words to you. Your good friend, the
warden here, and myself, and my lord the bishop, on whose behalf I
wish to speak to you, would all be very sorry, very sorry indeed,
that you should have any just ground of complaint. Any just ground
of complaint on your part would be removed at once by the warden, or
by his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) lordship, or by me on his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) behalf, without the necessity of
any petition on your part.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here the orator stopped for a moment,
expecting that some little murmurs of applause would show that
the weakest of the men were beginning to give way; but no such
murmurs came. Bunce, himself, even sat with closed lips, mute and
unsatisfactory. <div class="bookquote">``Without the necessity of any petition at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>)
repeated. <div class="bookquote">``I'm told you have addressed a petition to my lord.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>)
paused for a reply from the men, and after a while, Handy plucked up
courage and said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, we has.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have addressed a petition to my lord, in which, as I am informed,
you express an opinion that you do not receive from Hiram's estate all
that is your due.''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>Here most of the men expressed their assent. <div class="bookquote">``Now
what is it you ask for? What is it you want that you hav'n't got
here? What is it--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Moody</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A hundred a year,''  (<font color='red'><b>Moody</b></font>)</div>muttered old Moody, with a voice as if it came out
of the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A hundred a year!''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>ejaculated the archdeacon militant, defying the
impudence of these claimants with one hand stretched out and closed,
while with the other he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) tightly grasped, and secured within his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>)
breeches pocket, that symbol of the church's wealth which his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) own
loose half-crowns not unaptly represented. <div class="bookquote">``A hundred a year!
Why, my men, you must be mad; and you talk about John Hiram's will!
When John Hiram built a hospital for worn-out old men, worn-out old
labouring men, infirm old men past their work, cripples, blind,
bed-ridden, and such like, do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) meant to make gentlemen of
them? Do you think John Hiram intended to give a hundred a year to
old single men, who earned perhaps two shillings or half-a-crown a day
for themselves and families in the best of their time? No, my men,
I'll tell you what John Hiram meant: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) meant that twelve poor old
worn-out labourers, men who could no longer support themselves, who
had no friends to support them, who must starve and perish miserably
if not protected by the hand of charity;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) meant that twelve such
men as these should come in here in their poverty and wretchedness,
and find within these walls shelter and food before their death, and a
little leisure to make their peace with God. That was what John Hiram
meant: you have not read John Hiram's will, and I doubt whether those
wicked men who are advising you have done so. I have; I know what his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>)
will was; and I tell you that that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) will, and that that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>)
intention.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div><p/>Not a sound came from the eleven bedesmen, as they sat listening to
what, according to the archdeacon, was their intended estate. They
grimly stared upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) burly figure, but did not then express, by word
or sign, the anger and disgust to which such language was sure to give
rise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now let me ask you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) continued: <div class="bookquote">``do you think you are worse off
than John Hiram intended to make you? Have you not shelter, and food,
and leisure? Have you not much more? Have you not every indulgence
which you are capable of enjoying? Have you not twice better food,
twice a better bed, ten times more money in your pocket than you were
ever able to earn for yourselves before you were lucky enough to get
into this place? And now you send a petition to the bishop, asking
for a hundred pounds a year! I tell you what, my friends; you are
deluded, and made fools of by wicked men who are acting for their
own ends. You will never get a hundred pence a year more than what
you have now: it is very possible that you may get less; it is very
possible that my lord the bishop, and your warden, may make changes--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div>interrupted Mr Harding, who had been listening with
indescribable misery to the tirade of his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) son-in-law; <div class="bookquote">``no, my friends.
I want no changes,--at least no changes that shall make you worse off
than you now are, as long as you and I live together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>son-in-law</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you, Mr Harding,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bunce/Mr Bunce</b></font>)</div>said Bunce; and <div class="bookquote">``God bless you, Mr
Harding, God bless you, sir: we know you was always our friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bunce/Mr Bunce</b></font>)</div>was
exclaimed by enough of the men to make it appear that the sentiment
was general.

<p/>The archdeacon had been interrupted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) speech before he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) had quite
finished it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) could not recommence with dignity
after this little ebullition, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) led the way back into the garden,
followed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) father-in-law.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>), as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) found himself within the cool retreat
of the warden's garden; <div class="bookquote">``I think I spoke to them plainly.''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>)
wiped the perspiration from his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) brow; for making a speech under a
broiling mid-day sun in summer, in a full suit of thick black cloth,
is warm work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you were plain enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>replied the warden, in a tone which did
not express approbation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And that's everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other, who was clearly well
satisfied with himself; <div class="bookquote">``that's everything: with those sort of people
one must be plain, or one will not be understood. Now, I think they
did understand me;--I think they knew what I meant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The warden</b></font>)</div><p/>The warden agreed. He (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) certainly thought they had understood to the
full what had been said to them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They know pretty well what they have to expect from us; they know how
we shall meet any refractory spirit on their part; they know that we
are not afraid of them. And now I'll just step into Chadwick's, and
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) what I've done; and then I'll go up to the palace, and answer
this petition of theirs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The warden</b></font>)</div><p/>The warden's mind was very full,--full nearly to overcharging itself;
and had it done so,--had he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) allowed himself to speak the thoughts
which were working within him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) would indeed have astonished the
archdeacon by the reprobation he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) would have expressed as to the
proceeding of which he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had been so unwilling a witness. But different
feelings kept him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) silent; he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) was as yet afraid of differing from his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
son-in-law;--he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) was anxious beyond measure to avoid even a semblance
of rupture with any of his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) order, and was painfully fearful of having
to come to an open quarrel with any person on any subject. His (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) life
had hitherto been so quiet, so free from strife; his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) little early
troubles had required nothing but passive fortitude; his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) subsequent
prosperity had never forced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) any active cares,--had never
brought him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) into disagreeable contact with anyone. He (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) felt that
he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) would give almost anything,--much more than he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) ought to
do,--to relieve himself from the storm which he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) feared was coming.
It was so hard that the pleasant waters of his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) little stream should be
disturbed and muddied by rough hands; that his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) quiet paths should be
made a battlefield; that the unobtrusive corner of the world which had
been allotted to him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>), as though by Providence, should be invaded and
desecrated, and all within it made miserable and unsound.

<p/>Money he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had none to give; the knack of putting guineas together
had never belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>); but how willingly, with what a foolish
easiness, with what happy alacrity, would he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) have abandoned the half
of his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) income for all time to come, could he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) by so doing have quietly
dispelled the clouds that were gathering over him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>),--could he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) have thus
compromised the matter between the reformer and the conservative,
between his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) possible son-in-law, Bold, and his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) positive son-in-law,
the archdeacon.

<p/>And this compromise would not have been made from any prudential
motive of saving what would yet remain, for Mr Harding still felt
little doubt but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) should be left for life in quiet possession of the
good things he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) chose to retain them. No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) would have
done so from the sheer love of quiet, and from a horror of being made
the subject of public talk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had very often been moved to pity.--to
that inward weeping of the heart for others' woes; but none had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
ever pitied more than that old lord, whose almost fabulous wealth,
drawn from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) church preferments, had become the subject of so much
opprobrium, of such public scorn; that wretched clerical octogenarian
Croesus, whom men would not allow to die in peace,--whom all the world
united to decry and to abhor.

<p/>Was he (<font color='blue'><b>octogenarian</b></font>) to suffer such a fate? Was his (<font color='blue'><b>octogenarian</b></font>) humble name to be bandied in
men's mouths, as the gormandiser of the resources of the poor, as
of one who had filched from the charity of other ages wealth which
had been intended to relieve the old and the infirm? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>octogenarian</b></font>) to be
gibbeted in the press, to become a byword for oppression, to be named
as an example of the greed of the English church? Should it ever
be said that he (<font color='blue'><b>octogenarian</b></font>) had robbed those old men, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>octogenarian</b></font>) so truly and so
tenderly loved in his (<font color='blue'><b>octogenarian</b></font>) heart of hearts? As he (<font color='blue'><b>octogenarian</b></font>) slowly paced, hour after
hour, under those noble lime-trees, turning these sad thoughts within
him (<font color='blue'><b>octogenarian</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>octogenarian</b></font>) became all but fixed in his (<font color='blue'><b>octogenarian</b></font>) resolve that some great step must
be taken to relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>octogenarian</b></font>) from the risk of so terrible a fate.

<p/>In the meanwhile, the archdeacon, with contented mind and unruffled
spirit, went about his (<font color='blue'><b>octogenarian</b></font>) business. He (<font color='blue'><b>octogenarian</b></font>) said a word or two to Mr
Chadwick, and then finding, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) expected, the petition lying in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>)
father's library, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) wrote a short answer to the men, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) told
them that they had no evils to redress, but rather great mercies for
which to be thankful; and having seen the bishop sign it, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) got into
his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) brougham and returned home to Mrs Grantly, and Plumstead Episcopi.




<p/>Chapter VI

<p/>THE WARDEN``S TEA PARTY


<p/>After much painful doubting, on one thing only could Mr Harding
resolve. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) determined that at any rate he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) would take no offence, and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) would make this question no cause of quarrel either with Bold
or with the bedesmen. In furtherance of this resolution, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) himself
wrote a note to Mr Bold, the same afternoon, inviting him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) to meet a
few friends and hear some music on an evening named in the next week.
Had not this little party been promised to Eleanor, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) present
state of mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) would probably have avoided such gaiety; but the
promise had been given, the invitations were to be written, and when
Eleanor consulted her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father on the subject, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was not ill pleased
to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) say, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I was thinking of Bold, so I took it into my
head to write to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) myself, but you must write to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary Bold was older than her (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) brother, and, at the time of our story,
was just over thirty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) was not an unattractive young woman, though
by no means beautiful. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) great merit was the kindliness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>)
disposition. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) was not very clever, nor very animated, nor had she (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>)
apparently the energy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) brother; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) was guided by a high
principle of right and wrong; her (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) temper was sweet, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) faults
were fewer in number than her (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) virtues. Those who casually met Mary
Bold thought little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>); but those who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) well loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>)
well, and the longer they knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) the more they loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>). Among
those who were fondest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) was Eleanor Harding; and though Eleanor
had never openly talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) brother, each understood the
other's feelings about him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). The brother and sister were sitting
together when the two notes were brought in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How odd,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Bold</b></font>)</div>said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``that they should send two notes. Well, if Mr
Harding becomes fashionable, the world is going to change.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Bold</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) brother understood immediately the nature and intention of the
peace-offering; but it was not so easy for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to behave well in the
matter, as it was for Mr Harding. It is much less difficult for the
sufferer to be generous than for the oppressor. John Bold felt that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) could not go to the warden's party: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) never loved Eleanor better
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) did now; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) had never so strongly felt how anxious he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) was
to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) wife as now, when so many obstacles to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) doing
so appeared in view. Yet here was her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father himself, as it were,
clearing away those very obstacles, and still he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) could
not go to the house any more as an open friend.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) sat thinking of these things with the note in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) hand, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>)
sister was waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) decision.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I suppose we must write separate answers, and both
say we shall be very happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll go, of course, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>); to which she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) readily assented.
<div class="bookquote">``I cannot,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) continued, looking serious and gloomy. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I
could, with all my heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why not, John?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had as yet heard nothing of the
new-found abuse which her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother was about to reform;--at least
nothing which connected it with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother's name.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sat thinking for a while till he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) determined that it would be best
to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) at once what it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was about: it must be done
sooner or later.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear I cannot go to Mr Harding's house any more as a friend, just
at present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, John! Why not? Ah, you've quarrelled with Eleanor!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I've no quarrel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) as yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, John?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) with an anxious, loving
face, for she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) knew well how much of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) heart was there in that house
which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could no longer enter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) at last, <div class="bookquote">``I've taken up the case of these twelve
old men of Hiram's Hospital, and of course that brings me into
contact with Mr Harding. I may have to oppose him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), interfere with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>),--perhaps injure him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) steadily for some time before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) committed
herself to reply, and then merely asked him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) meant to do
for the old men.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it's a long story, and I don't know that I can make you
understand it. John Hiram made a will, and left his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) property in
charity for certain poor old men, and the proceeds, instead of going
to the benefit of these men, go chiefly into the pocket of the warden
and the bishop's steward.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you mean to take away from Mr Harding his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) share of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what I mean yet. I mean to inquire about it. I mean to
see who is entitled to this property. I mean to see, if I can, that
justice be done to the poor of the city of Barchester generally, who
are, in fact, the legatees under the will. I mean, in short, to put
the matter right, if I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why are you to do this, John?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You might ask the same question of anybody else,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``and
according to that the duty of righting these poor men would belong to
nobody. If we are to act on that principle, the weak are never to be
protected, injustice is never to be opposed, and no one is to struggle
for the poor!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And Bold began to comfort himself in the warmth of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
own virtue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But is there no one to do this but you, who have known Mr Harding so
long? Surely, John, as a friend, as a young friend, so much younger
than Mr Harding--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's woman's logic, all over, Mary. What has age to do with it?
Another man might plead that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was too old; and as to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friendship,
if the thing itself be right, private motives should never be allowed
to interfere. Because I esteem Mr Harding, is that a reason that I
should neglect a duty which I owe to these old men? or should I give
up a work which my conscience tells me is a good one, because I regret
the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) society?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Eleanor, John?''  (<font color='red'><b>the sister</b></font>)</div>said the sister, looking timidly into her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
brother's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eleanor, that is, Miss Harding, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) thinks fit,--that is, if
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) father--or, rather, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)--or, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),--if they find it
necessary--but there is no necessity now to talk about Eleanor
Harding; but this I will say, that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) has the kind of spirit for
which I give her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) credit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) will not condemn me for doing what I
think to be a duty.''  (<font color='red'><b>a Roman</b></font>)</div>And Bold consoled himself with the consolation
of a Roman.

<p/>Mary sat silent for a while, till at last her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) brother reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
that the notes must be answered, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) got up, and placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) desk
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), took out her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pen and paper, wrote on it slowly:


<p/>PAKENHAM VILLAS
Tuesday morning
MY DEAR ELEANOR,

<p/>I--


<p/>and then stopped, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>ELEANOR</b></font>) brother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mary, why don't you write it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, John,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>ELEANOR</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``dear John, pray think better of this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Think better of what?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of this about the hospital,--of all this about Mr Harding,--of what
you say about those old men. Nothing can call upon you,--no duty can
require you to set yourself against your oldest, your best friend.
Oh, John, think of Eleanor. You'll break her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) heart, and your own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Mary; Miss Harding's heart is as safe as yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, pray, for my sake, John, give it up. You know how dearly you
love her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>ELEANOR</b></font>) came and knelt before him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) on the rug. <div class="bookquote">``Pray
give it up. You are going to make yourself, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) father
miserable: you are going to make us all miserable. And for what? For
a dream of justice. You will never make those twelve men happier than
they now are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't understand it, my dear girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), smoothing her (<font color='blue'><b>ELEANOR</b></font>) hair
with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do understand it, John. I understand that this is a chimera,--a
dream that you have got. I know well that no duty can require you to
do this mad--this suicidal thing. I know you love Eleanor Harding
with all your heart, and I tell you now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) loves you as well.
If there was a plain, a positive duty before you, I would be the last
to bid you neglect it for any woman's love; but this--; oh, think
again, before you do anything to make it necessary that you and Mr
Harding should be at variance.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did not answer, as she (<font color='blue'><b>ELEANOR</b></font>) knelt
there, leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knees, but by his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) face she (<font color='blue'><b>ELEANOR</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was
inclined to yield. <div class="bookquote">``At any rate let me say that you will go to this
party. At any rate do not break with them while your mind is in
doubt.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>ELEANOR</b></font>) got up, hoping to conclude her (<font color='blue'><b>ELEANOR</b></font>) note in the way she (<font color='blue'><b>ELEANOR</b></font>)
desired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My mind is not in doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>at last he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said, rising. <div class="bookquote">``I could never
respect myself again were I to give way now, because Eleanor Harding
is beautiful. I do love her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>): I would give a hand to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) tell
me what you have said, speaking on her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) behalf; but I cannot for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
sake go back from the task which I have commenced. I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) may
hereafter acknowledge and respect my motives, but I cannot now go as
a guest to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) father's house.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Barchester Brutus</b></font>)</div>And the Barchester Brutus went out
to fortify his (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) own resolution by meditations on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) own virtue.

<p/>Poor Mary Bold sat down, and sadly finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) note, saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>)
would herself attend the party, but that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) brother was unavoidably
prevented from doing so. I fear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) did not admire as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) should
have done the self-devotion of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) singular virtue.

<p/>The party went off as such parties do. There were fat old ladies, in
fine silk dresses, and slim young ladies, in gauzy muslin frocks; old
gentlemen stood up with their backs to the empty fire-place, looking
by no means so comfortable as they would have done in their own
arm-chairs at home; and young gentlemen, rather stiff about the neck,
clustered near the door, not as yet sufficiently in courage to attack
the muslin frocks, who awaited the battle, drawn up in a semicircular
array. The warden endeavoured to induce a charge, but failed
signally, not having the tact of a general; his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) daughter did what she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
could to comfort the forces under her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) command, who took in refreshing
rations of cake and tea, and patiently looked for the coming
engagement: but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) herself, Eleanor, had no spirit for the work; the
only enemy whose lance she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) cared to encounter was not there, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
and others were somewhat dull.

<p/>Loud above all voices was heard the clear sonorous tones of the
archdeacon as he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) dilated to brother parsons of the danger of the
church, of the fearful rumours of mad reforms even at Oxford, and of
the damnable heresies of Dr Whiston.

<p/>Soon, however, sweeter sounds began timidly to make themselves
audible. Little movements were made in a quarter notable for round
stools and music stands. Wax candles were arranged in sconces, big
books were brought from hidden recesses, and the work of the evening
commenced.

<p/>How often were those pegs twisted and re-twisted before our friend
found that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had twisted them enough; how many discordant scrapes
gave promise of the coming harmony. How much the muslin fluttered
and crumpled before Eleanor and another nymph were duly seated at the
piano; how closely did that tall Apollo pack himself against the wall,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) flute, long as himself, extending high over the heads of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
pretty neighbours; into how small a corner crept that round and florid
little minor canon, and there with skill amazing found room to tune
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) accustomed fiddle!

<p/>And now the crash begins: away they go in full flow of harmony
together,--up hill and down dale,--now louder and louder, then
lower and lower; now loud, as though stirring the battle; then low,
as though mourning the slain. In all, through all, and above all,
is heard the violoncello. Ah, not for nothing were those pegs so
twisted and re-twisted;--listen, listen! Now alone that saddest
of instruments tells its touching tale. Silent, and in awe, stand
fiddle, flute, and piano, to hear the sorrows of their wailing
brother. ``Tis but for a moment: before the melancholy of those low
notes has been fully realised, again comes the full force of all the
band;--down go the pedals, away rush twenty fingers scouring over the
bass notes with all the impetus of passion. Apollo blows till his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
stiff neckcloth is no better than a rope, and the minor canon works
with both arms till he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) falls in a syncope of exhaustion against the
wall.

<p/>How comes it that now, when all should be silent, when courtesy, if
not taste, should make men listen,--how is it at this moment the
black-coated corps leave their retreat and begin skirmishing? One by
one they creep forth, and fire off little guns timidly, and without
precision. Ah, my men, efforts such as these will take no cities,
even though the enemy should be never so open to assault. At length a
more deadly artillery is brought to bear; slowly, but with effect, the
advance is made; the muslin ranks are broken, and fall into confusion;
the formidable array of chairs gives way; the battle is no longer
between opposing regiments, but hand to hand, and foot to foot with
single combatants, as in the glorious days of old, when fighting was
really noble. In corners, and under the shadow of curtains, behind
sofas and half hidden by doors, in retiring windows, and sheltered
by hanging tapestry, are blows given and returned, fatal, incurable,
dealing death.

<p/>Apart from this another combat arises, more sober and more serious.
The archdeacon is engaged against two prebendaries, a pursy full-blown
rector assisting him (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>), in all the perils and all the enjoyments of
short whist. With solemn energy do they watch the shuffled pack, and,
all-expectant, eye the coming trump. With what anxious nicety do they
arrange their cards, jealous of each other's eyes! Why is that lean
doctor so slow,--cadaverous man with hollow jaw and sunken eye, ill
beseeming the richness of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) mother church! Ah, why so slow, thou
meagre doctor? See how the archdeacon, speechless in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) agony,
deposits on the board his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) cards, and looks to heaven or to the ceiling
for support. Hark, how he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) sighs, as with thumbs in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) waistcoat
pocket he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) seems to signify that the end of such torment is not yet
even nigh at hand! Vain is the hope, if hope there be, to disturb
that meagre doctor. With care precise he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) places every card,
weighs well the value of each mighty ace, each guarded king, and
comfort-giving queen; speculates on knave and ten, counts all his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)
suits, and sets his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) price upon the whole. At length a card is led,
and quick three others fall upon the board. The little doctor leads
again, while with lustrous eye his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) partner absorbs the trick. Now
thrice has this been done,--thrice has constant fortune favoured
the brace of prebendaries, ere the archdeacon rouses himself to the
battle; but at the fourth assault he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) pins to the earth a prostrate
king, laying low his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) crown and sceptre, bushy beard, and lowering
brow, with a poor deuce.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As David did Goliath,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>says the archdeacon, pushing over the four
cards to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) partner. And then a trump is led, then another trump;
then a king,--and then an ace,--and then a long ten, which brings
down from the meagre doctor his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) only remaining tower of strength--his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
cherished queen of trumps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, no second club?''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>says the archdeacon to his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) partner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only one club,''  (<font color='red'><b>the pursy rector a</b></font>)</div>mutters from his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) inmost stomach the pursy rector, who
sits there red-faced, silent, impervious, careful, a safe but not a
brilliant ally.

<p/>But the archdeacon cares not for many clubs, or for none. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) dashes
out his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) remaining cards with a speed most annoying to his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) antagonists,
pushes over to them some four cards as their allotted portion, shoves
the remainder across the table to the red-faced rector; calls out <div class="bookquote">``two
by cards and two by honours, and the odd trick last time,''  (<font color='red'><b>the rector</b></font>)</div>marks a
treble under the candle-stick, and has dealt round the second pack
before the meagre doctor has calculated his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) losses.

<p/>And so went off the warden's party, and men and women arranging shawls
and shoes declared how pleasant it had been; and Mrs Goodenough, the
red-faced rector's wife, pressing the warden's hand, declared she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) had
never enjoyed herself better; which showed how little pleasure she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>)
allowed herself in this world, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) had sat the whole evening
through in the same chair without occupation, not speaking, and
unspoken to. And Matilda Johnson, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) allowed young Dickson of
the bank to fasten her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) cloak round her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) neck, thought that two hundred
pounds a year and a little cottage would really do for happiness;
besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickson</b></font>) was sure to be manager some day. And Apollo, folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickson</b></font>)
flute into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickson</b></font>) pocket, felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickson</b></font>) had acquitted himself with honour;
and the archdeacon pleasantly jingled his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickson</b></font>) gains; but the meagre doctor
went off without much audible speech, muttering ever and anon as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
went, <div class="bookquote">``three and thirty points!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``three and thirty points!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div><p/>And so they all were gone, and Mr Harding was left alone with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
daughter.

<p/>What had passed between Eleanor Harding and Mary Bold need not
be told. It is indeed a matter of thankfulness that neither the
historian nor the novelist hears all that is said by their heroes
or heroines, or how would three volumes or twenty suffice! In the
present case so little of this sort have I overheard, that I live
in hopes of finishing my work within 300 pages, and of completing
that pleasant task--a novel in one volume; but something had passed
between them, and as the warden blew out the wax candles, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
instrument into its case, his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) daughter stood sad and thoughtful by the
empty fire-place, determined to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father, but irresolute as
to what she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Eleanor,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``are you for bed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), moving, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose so; but papa--Mr Bold was not here
tonight; do you know why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) was asked; I wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>said the warden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But do you know why he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) did not come, papa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Eleanor, I could guess; but it's no use guessing at such
things, my dear. What makes you look so earnest about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa, do tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) exclaimed, throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) arms round him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>),
and looking into his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) face; <div class="bookquote">``what is it he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is going to do? What is it
all about? Is there any--any--any--''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) didn't well know what word
to use--<div class="bookquote">``any danger?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Danger, my dear, what sort of danger?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Danger to you, danger of trouble, and of loss, and of--Oh, papa, why
haven't you told me of all this before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Harding was not the man to judge harshly of anyone, much less of
the daughter whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) now loved better than any living creature; but
still he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) did judge her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) wrongly at this moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) loved
John Bold; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) fully sympathised in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) affection; day after day he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
thought more of the matter, and, with the tender care of a loving
father, tried to arrange in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own mind how matters might be so
managed that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter's heart should not be made the sacrifice to
the dispute which was likely to exist between him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and Bold. Now, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for the first time on the subject, it was natural
that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should think more of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) than of himself, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should
imagine that her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own cares, and not his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), were troubling her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stood silent before her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) awhile, as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) gazed up into his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face, and
then kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) forehead he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) placed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) on the sofa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, Nelly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) only called her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) Nelly in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) kindest,
softest, sweetest moods, and yet all his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) moods were kind and sweet-RRB-,
<div class="bookquote">``tell me, Nelly, do you like Mr Bold--much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nelly</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was quite taken aback by the question. I will not say that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
had forgotten herself, and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own love in thinking about John Bold,
and while conversing with Mary: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) certainly had not done so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
had been sick at heart to think that a man of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not but
own to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), of whose regard she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been so
proud, that such a man should turn against her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father to ruin him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) vanity hurt, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not kept
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from such a course; had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really cared for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not have
risked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) love by such an outrage. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) main fear had been for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) spoke of danger, it was of danger to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and
not to herself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was taken aback by the question altogether: <div class="bookquote">``Do I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>), papa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Nelly, do you like him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>)? Why shouldn't you like him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>)? but that's
a poor word;--do you love him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sat still in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arms without
answering him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) certainly had not prepared herself for an avowal
of affection, intending, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had done, to abuse John Bold herself,
and to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father do so also. <div class="bookquote">``Come, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``let us
make a clean breast of it: do you tell me what concerns yourself, and
I will tell you what concerns me and the hospital.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And then, without waiting for an answer, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) described to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
best could, the accusation that was made about Hiram's will; the
claims which the old men put forward; what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) considered the strength
and what the weakness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) own position; the course which Bold had
taken, and that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) presumed he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) was about to take; and then
by degrees, without further question, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) presumed on the fact of
Eleanor's love, and spoke of that love as a feeling which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) could in
no way disapprove: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) apologised for Bold, excused what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) was doing;
nay, praised him (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) energy and intentions; made much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) good
qualities, and harped on none of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) foibles; then, reminding his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>)
daughter how late it was, and comforting her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) with much assurance which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) hardly felt himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) sent her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) room, with flowing eyes and
a full heart.

<p/>When Mr Harding met his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) daughter at breakfast the next morning, there
was no further discussion on the matter, nor was the subject mentioned
between them for some days. Soon after the party Mary Bold called at
the hospital, but there were various persons in the drawing-room at
the time, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) therefore said nothing about her (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) brother. On the
day following, John Bold met Miss Harding in one of the quiet, sombre,
shaded walks of the close. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) was most anxious to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), but
unwilling to call at the warden's house, and had in truth waylaid her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) private haunts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My sister tells me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>), abruptly hurrying on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>)
premeditated speech, <div class="bookquote">``my sister tells me that you had a delightful
party the other evening. I was so sorry I could not be there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We were all sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Harding/ELEANOR</b></font>)</div>said Eleanor, with dignified composure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe, Miss Harding, you understand why, at this moment--''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Harding/ELEANOR</b></font>)</div>And
Bold hesitated, muttered, stopped, commenced his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) explanation again,
and again broke down.

<p/>Eleanor would not help him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) in the least.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think my sister explained to you, Miss Harding?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray don't apologise, Mr Bold; my father will, I am sure, always be
glad to see you, if you like to come to the house now as formerly;
nothing has occurred to alter his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) feelings: of your own views you are,
of course, the best judge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father is all that is kind and generous; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always was so; but
you, Miss Harding, yourself--I hope you will not judge me harshly,
because--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Bold,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you may be sure of one thing; I shall always
judge my father to be right, and those who oppose him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) I shall judge
to be wrong. If those who do not know him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) oppose him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), I shall have
charity enough to believe that they are wrong, through error of
judgment; but should I see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) attacked by those who ought to know
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and to love him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and revere him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), of such I shall be constrained
to form a different opinion.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then curtseying low she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) sailed on,
leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) lover in anything but a happy state of mind.




<p/>Chapter VII

<p/>_THE JUPITER_


<p/>Though Eleanor Harding rode off from John Bold on a high horse, it
must not be supposed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) heart was so elate as her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) demeanour.
In the first place, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had a natural repugnance to losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
lover; and in the next, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was not quite so sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was in
the right as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) pretended to be. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) father had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), and that
now repeatedly, that Bold was doing nothing unjust or ungenerous;
and why then should she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) rebuke him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and throw him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) off, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) felt
herself so ill able to bear his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) loss?--but such is human nature, and
young-lady-nature especially.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) walked off from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) beneath the shady elms of the close, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
look, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) tone, every motion and gesture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) body, belied her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
heart; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) would have given the world to have taken him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) by the hand,
to have reasoned with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), cajoled him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), coaxed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) project; to have overcome him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) female artillery,
and to have redeemed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) father at the cost of herself; but pride
would not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) do this, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) without a look of love or
a word of kindness.

<p/>Had Bold been judging of another lover and of another lady, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) might
have understood all this as well as we do; but in matters of love men
do not see clearly in their own affairs. They say that faint heart
never won fair lady; and it is amazing to me how fair ladies are
won, so faint are often men's hearts! Were it not for the kindness
of their nature, that seeing the weakness of our courage they will
occasionally descend from their impregnable fortresses, and themselves
aid us in effecting their own defeat, too often would they escape
unconquered if not unscathed, and free of body if not of heart.

<p/>Poor Bold crept off quite crestfallen; he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) felt that as regarded
Eleanor Harding his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) fate was sealed, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) could consent to give
up a task to which he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) had pledged himself, and which indeed it would
not be easy for him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) to give up. Lawyers were engaged, and the
question had to a certain extent been taken up by the public; besides,
how could a high-spirited girl like Eleanor Harding really learn to
love a man for neglecting a duty which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) assumed! Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) allow
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) affection to be purchased at the cost of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own self-respect?

<p/>As regarded the issue of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attempt at reformation in the hospital,
Bold had no reason hitherto to be discontented with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) success.
All Barchester was by the ears about it. The bishop, the archdeacon,
the warden, the steward, and several other clerical allies, had daily
meetings, discussing their tactics, and preparing for the great
attack. Sir Abraham Haphazard had been consulted, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Haphazard</b></font>) opinion was
not yet received: copies of Hiram's will, copies of wardens' journals,
copies of leases, copies of accounts, copies of everything that could
be copied, and of some that could not, had been sent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Haphazard</b></font>); and the
case was assuming most creditable dimensions. But, above all, it had
been mentioned in the daily _Jupiter_. That all-powerful organ of
the press in one of its leading thunderbolts launched at St Cross, had
thus remarked: <div class="bookquote">``Another case, of smaller dimensions indeed, but of
similar import, is now likely to come under public notice. We are
informed that the warden or master of an old almshouse attached to
Barchester Cathedral is in receipt of twenty-five times the annual
income appointed for him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) by the will of the founder, while the sum
yearly expended on the absolute purposes of the charity has always
remained fixed. In other words, the legatees under the founder's
will have received no advantage from the increase in the value of the
property during the last four centuries, such increase having been
absorbed by the so-called warden. It is impossible to conceive a
case of greater injustice. It is no answer to say that some six or
nine or twelve old men receive as much of the goods of this world
as such old men require. On what foundation, moral or divine,
traditional or legal, is grounded the warden's claim to the large
income he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) receives for doing nothing? The contentment of these
almsmen, if content they be, can give him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) no title to this wealth!
Does he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) ever ask himself, when he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) stretches wide his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) clerical palm to
receive the pay of some dozen of the working clergy, for what service
he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) is so remunerated? Does his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) conscience ever entertain the question
of his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) right to such subsidies? Or is it possible that the subject
never so presents itself to his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) mind; that he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) has received for many
years, and intends, should God spare him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), to receive for years to come
these fruits of the industrious piety of past ages, indifferent as to
any right on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own part, or of any injustice to others! We must
express an opinion that nowhere but in the Church of England, and only
there among its priests, could such a state of moral indifference be
found.''

 (<font color='red'><b>St Cross</b></font>)</div><p/>I must for the present leave my readers to imagine the state of Mr
Harding's mind after reading the above article. They say that forty
thousand copies of _The Jupiter_ are daily sold, and that each copy is
read by five persons at the least. Two hundred thousand readers then
would hear this accusation against him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>); two hundred thousand hearts
would swell with indignation at the griping injustice, the barefaced
robbery of the warden of Barchester Hospital! And how was he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) to
answer this? How was he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) to open his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) inmost heart to this multitude,
to these thousands, the educated, the polished, the picked men of his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
own country; how show them that he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) was no robber, no avaricious, lazy
priest scrambling for gold, but a retiring, humble-spirited man, who
had innocently taken what had innocently been offered to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Write to _The Jupiter_,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bishop</b></font>)</div>suggested the bishop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>said the archdeacon, more worldly wise than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, <div class="bookquote">``yes,
and be smothered with ridicule; tossed over and over again with
scorn; shaken this way and that, as a rat in the mouth of a practised
terrier. You will leave out some word or letter in your answer, and
the ignorance of the cathedral clergy will be harped upon; you will
make some small mistake, which will be a falsehood, or some admission,
which will be self-condemnation; you will find yourself to have been
vulgar, ill-tempered, irreverend, and illiterate, and the chances are
ten to one, but that being a clergyman, you will have been guilty of
blasphemy! A man may have the best of causes, the best of talents,
and the best of tempers; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may write as well as Addison, or as
strongly as Junius; but even with all this he (<font color='blue'><b>Addison</b></font>) cannot successfully
answer, when attacked by _The Jupiter_. In such matters it is
omnipotent. What the Czar is in Russia, or the mob in America, that
_The Jupiter_ is in England. Answer such an article! No, warden;
whatever you do, don't do that. We were to look for this sort of
thing, you know; but we need not draw down on our heads more of it
than is necessary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>The article in _The Jupiter_, while it so greatly harassed our poor
warden, was an immense triumph to some of the opposite party. Sorry
as Bold was to see Mr Harding attacked so personally, it still gave
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) a feeling of elation to find his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) cause taken up by so powerful
an advocate: and as to Finney, the attorney, he (<font color='blue'><b>Finney</b></font>) was beside himself.
What! to be engaged in the same cause and on the same side with
_The Jupiter_; to have the views he (<font color='blue'><b>Finney</b></font>) had recommended seconded, and
furthered, and battled for by _The Jupiter_! Perhaps to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Finney</b></font>) own
name mentioned as that of the learned gentleman whose efforts had
been so successful on behalf of the poor of Barchester! He (<font color='blue'><b>Finney</b></font>) might be
examined before committees of the House of Commons, with heaven knows
how much a day for his (<font color='blue'><b>Finney</b></font>) personal expenses;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Finney</b></font>) might be engaged for
years on such a suit! There was no end to the glorious golden dreams
which this leader in _The Jupiter_ produced in the soaring mind of
Finney.

<p/>And the old bedesmen, they also heard of this article, and had a
glimmering, indistinct idea of the marvellous advocate which had now
taken up their cause. Abel Handy limped hither and thither through
the rooms, repeating all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Handy</b></font>) understood to have been printed,
with some additions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Handy</b></font>) own which he (<font color='blue'><b>Handy</b></font>) thought should have been
added. He (<font color='blue'><b>Handy</b></font>) told them how _The Jupiter_ had declared that their warden
was no better than a robber, and that what _The Jupiter_ said was
acknowledged by the world to be true. How _The Jupiter_ had affirmed
that each one of them--<div class="bookquote">``each one of us, Jonathan Crumple, think of
that!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--had a clear right to a hundred a year; and that if _The
Jupiter_ had said so, it was better than a decision of the Lord
Chancellor: and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) carried about the paper, supplied by Mr
Finney, which, though none of them could read it, still afforded in
its very touch and aspect positive corroboration of what was told
them; and Jonathan Crumple pondered deeply over his (<font color='blue'><b>Crumple</b></font>) returning wealth;
and Job Skulpit saw how right he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumple</b></font>) had been in signing the petition, and
said so many scores of times; and Spriggs leered fearfully with his (<font color='blue'><b>Spriggs</b></font>)
one eye; and Moody, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) more nearly approached the coming golden
age, hated more deeply than ever those who still kept possession of
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) so coveted. Even Billy Gazy and poor bed-ridden Bell became
active and uneasy, and the great Bunce stood apart with lowering brow,
with deep grief seated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) heart, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) perceived that evil days
were coming.

<p/>It had been decided, the archdeacon advising, that no remonstrance,
explanation, or defence should be addressed from the Barchester
conclave to the editor of _The Jupiter_; but hitherto that was the
only decision to which they had come.

<p/>Sir Abraham Haphazard was deeply engaged in preparing a bill for the
mortification of papists, to be called the <div class="bookquote">``Convent Custody Bill,''
 (<font color='red'><b>papists</b></font>)</div>the purport of which was to enable any Protestant clergyman over
fifty years of age to search any nun whom he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) suspected of being in
possession of treasonable papers or Jesuitical symbols; and as there
were to be a hundred and thirty-seven clauses in the bill, each clause
containing a separate thorn for the side of the papist, and as it
was known the bill would be fought inch by inch, by fifty maddened
Irishmen, the due construction and adequate dovetailing of it did
consume much of Sir Abraham's time. The bill had all its desired
effect. Of course it never passed into law; but it so completely
divided the ranks of the Irish members, who had bound themselves
together to force on the ministry a bill for compelling all men to
drink Irish whiskey, and all women to wear Irish poplins, that for
the remainder of the session the Great Poplin and Whiskey League was
utterly harmless.

<p/>Thus it happened that Sir Abraham's opinion was not at once
forthcoming, and the uncertainty, the expectation, and suffering of
the folk of Barchester was maintained at a high pitch.




<p/>Chapter VIII

<p/>PLUMSTEAD EPISCOPI


<p/>The reader must now be requested to visit the rectory of Plumstead
Episcopi; and as it is as yet still early morning, to ascend again
with us into the bedroom of the archdeacon. The mistress of the
mansion was at her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) toilet; on which we will not dwell with profane
eyes, but proceed into a small inner room, where the doctor dressed
and kept his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) boots and sermons; and here we will take our stand,
premising that the door of the room was so open as to admit of a
conversation between our reverend Adam and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) valued Eve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all your own fault, archdeacon,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the latter. <div class="bookquote">``I told you
from the beginning how it would end, and papa has no one to thank but
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good gracious, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, appearing at the door of
his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) dressing-room, with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) face and head enveloped in the rough towel
which he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was violently using; <div class="bookquote">``how can you say so? I am doing my very
best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you had never done so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady, interrupting him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``If you'd just have let John Bold come and go there, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) and papa
liked, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) and Eleanor would have been married by this time, and we
should not have heard one word about all this affair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's all very well, archdeacon; and of course you're right; I
don't for a moment think you'll ever admit that you could be wrong;
but the fact is, you've brought this young man down upon papa by
huffing him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) as you have done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my love--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And all because you didn't like John Bold for a brother-in-law.
How is she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ever to do better? Papa hasn't got a shilling; and though
Eleanor is well enough, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) has not at all a taking style of beauty.
I'm sure I don't know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)'s to do better than marry John Bold; or
as well indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sister</b></font>)</div>added the anxious sister, giving the last twist to
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) last shoe-string.

<p/>Dr Grantly felt keenly the injustice of this attack; but what could he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
say? He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) certainly had huffed John Bold; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) certainly had objected to
him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) as a brother-in-law, and a very few months ago the very idea had
excited his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wrath: but now matters were changed; John Bold had shown
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) power, and, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) was as odious as ever to the archdeacon,
power is always respected, and the reverend dignitary began to think
that such an alliance might not have been imprudent. Nevertheless,
his (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>) motto was still <div class="bookquote">``no surrender;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>) would still fight it out;
he (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>) believed confidently in Oxford, in the bench of bishops, in Sir
Abraham Haphazard, and in himself; and it was only when alone with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Haphazard</b></font>) wife that doubts of defeat ever beset him (<font color='blue'><b>Haphazard</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Haphazard</b></font>) once more tried to
communicate this confidence to Mrs Grantly, and for the twentieth time
began to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) of Sir Abraham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sir Abraham!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>), collecting all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) house keys into her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>)
basket before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) descended; <div class="bookquote">``Sir Abraham won't get Eleanor a husband;
Sir Abraham won't get papa another income when he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) has been worreted
out of the hospital. Mark what I tell you, archdeacon: while you and
Sir Abraham are fighting, papa will lose his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) preferment; and what will
you do then with him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) and Eleanor on your hands? besides, who's to pay
Sir Abraham? I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) won't take the case up for nothing?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And
so the lady descended to family worship among her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) children and
servants, the pattern of a good and prudent wife.

<p/>Dr Grantly was blessed with a happy, thriving family. There were,
first, three boys, now at home from school for the holidays. They
were called, respectively, Charles James, Henry, and Samuel. The two
younger -LRB-there were five in all-RRB- were girls; the elder, Florinda, bore
the name of the Archbishop of York's wife, whose godchild she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was:
and the younger had been christened Grizzel, after a sister of the
Archbishop of Canterbury. The boys were all clever, and gave good
promise of being well able to meet the cares and trials of the world;
and yet they were not alike in their dispositions, and each had his (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>)
individual character, and each his (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>) separate admirers among the
doctor's friends.

<p/>Charles James was an exact and careful boy; he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) never committed
himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) well knew how much was expected from the eldest son of the
Archdeacon of Barchester, and was therefore mindful not to mix too
freely with other boys. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had not the great talents of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) younger
brothers, but he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) exceeded them in judgment and propriety of demeanour;
his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) fault, if he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had one, was an over-attention to words instead of
things; there was a thought too much finesse about him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), and, as even
his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) father sometimes told him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) was too fond of a compromise.

<p/>The second was the archdeacon's favourite son, and Henry was indeed a
brilliant boy. The versatility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) genius was surprising, and the
visitors at Plumstead Episcopi were often amazed at the marvellous
manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would, when called on, adapt his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) capacity to
apparently most uncongenial pursuits. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) appeared once before a large
circle as Luther the reformer, and delighted them with the perfect
manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Luther</b></font>) assumed the character; and within three days he (<font color='blue'><b>Luther</b></font>)
again astonished them by acting the part of a Capuchin friar to the
very life. For this last exploit his (<font color='blue'><b>Luther</b></font>) father gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Luther</b></font>) a golden guinea,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Luther</b></font>) brothers said the reward had been promised beforehand in the
event of the performance being successful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luther</b></font>) was also sent on a tour
into Devonshire; a treat which the lad was most anxious of enjoying.
His (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) father's friends there, however, did not appreciate his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) talents,
and sad accounts were sent home of the perversity of his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) nature. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
was a most courageous lad, game to the backbone.

<p/>It was soon known, both at home, where he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) lived, and within some miles
of Barchester Cathedral, and also at Westminster, where he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was at
school, that young Henry could box well and would never own himself
beat; other boys would fight while they had a leg to stand on, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
would fight with no leg at all. Those backing him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would sometimes
think him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) crushed by the weight of blows and faint with loss of blood,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) friends would endeavour to withdraw him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) from the contest; but
no, Henry never gave in, was never weary of the battle. The ring was
the only element in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) seemed to enjoy himself; and while other
boys were happy in the number of their friends, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) rejoiced most in
the multitude of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) foes.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) relations could not but admire his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) pluck, but they sometimes were
forced to regret that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was inclined to be a bully; and those not
so partial to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) father was, observed with pain that, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) could fawn to the masters and the archdeacon's friends, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was
imperious and masterful to the servants and the poor.

<p/>But perhaps Samuel was the general favourite; and dear little Soapy,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was familiarly called, was as engaging a child as ever fond
mother petted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was soft and gentle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) manners, and attractive
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) speech; the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) voice was melody, and every action was
a grace; unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) brothers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was courteous to all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was affable
to the lowly, and meek even to the very scullery-maid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was a boy
of great promise, minding his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) books and delighting the hearts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
masters. His (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) brothers, however, were not particularly fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>);
they would complain to their mother that Soapy's civility all meant
something; they thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) voice was too often listened to at
Plumstead Episcopi, and evidently feared that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) grew up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
would have more weight in the house than either of them; there was,
therefore, a sort of agreement among them to put young Soapy down.
This, however, was not so easy to be done; Samuel, though young, was
sharp; he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) could not assume the stiff decorum of Charles James, nor
could he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) fight like Henry; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was a perfect master of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own
weapons, and contrived, in the teeth of both of them, to hold the
place which he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had assumed. Henry declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was a false,
cunning creature; and Charles James, though he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) always spoke of him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) as
his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) dear brother Samuel, was not slow to say a word against him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) when
opportunity offered. To speak the truth, Samuel was a cunning boy,
and those even who loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) best could not but own that for one so
young, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was too adroit in choosing his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) words, and too skilled in
modulating his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) voice.

<p/>The two little girls Florinda and Grizzel were nice little girls
enough, but they did not possess the strong sterling qualities of
their brothers; their voices were not often heard at Plumstead
Episcopi; they were bashful and timid by nature, slow to speak before
company even when asked to do so; and though they looked very nice in
their clean white muslin frocks and pink sashes, they were but little
noticed by the archdeacon's visitors.

<p/>Whatever of submissive humility may have appeared in the gait and
visage of the archdeacon during his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) colloquy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) wife in the
sanctum of their dressing-rooms was dispelled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
breakfast-parlour with erect head and powerful step. In the presence
of a third person he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) assumed the lord and master; and that wise and
talented lady too well knew the man to whom her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lot for life was
bound, to stretch her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) authority beyond the point at which it would be
borne. Strangers at Plumstead Episcopi, when they saw the imperious
brow with which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) commanded silence from the large circle of
visitors, children, and servants who came together in the morning to
hear him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read the word of God, and watched how meekly that wife seated
herself behind her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) basket of keys with a little girl on each side,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) caught that commanding glance; strangers, I say, seeing this,
could little guess that some fifteen minutes since she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had stoutly
held her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ground against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), hardly allowing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to open his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own defence. But such is the tact and talent of women!

<p/>And now let us observe the well-furnished breakfast-parlour at
Plumstead Episcopi, and the comfortable air of all the belongings of
the rectory. Comfortable they certainly were, but neither gorgeous
nor even grand; indeed, considering the money that had been spent
there, the eye and taste might have been better served; there was an
air of heaviness about the rooms which might have been avoided without
any sacrifice of propriety; colours might have been better chosen and
lights more perfectly diffused; but perhaps in doing so the thorough
clerical aspect of the whole might have been somewhat marred; at any
rate, it was not without ample consideration that those thick, dark,
costly carpets were put down; those embossed, but sombre papers hung
up; those heavy curtains draped so as to half exclude the light of
the sun: nor were these old-fashioned chairs, bought at a price far
exceeding that now given for more modern goods, without a purpose.
The breakfast-service on the table was equally costly and equally
plain; the apparent object had been to spend money without obtaining
brilliancy or splendour. The urn was of thick and solid silver, as
were also the tea-pot, coffee-pot, cream-ewer, and sugar-bowl; the
cups were old, dim dragon china, worth about a pound a piece, but very
despicable in the eyes of the uninitiated. The silver forks were so
heavy as to be disagreeable to the hand, and the bread-basket was of a
weight really formidable to any but robust persons. The tea consumed
was the very best, the coffee the very blackest, the cream the
very thickest; there was dry toast and buttered toast, muffins and
crumpets; hot bread and cold bread, white bread and brown bread,
home-made bread and bakers' bread, wheaten bread and oaten bread; and
if there be other breads than these, they were there; there were eggs
in napkins, and crispy bits of bacon under silver covers; and there
were little fishes in a little box, and devilled kidneys frizzling on
a hot-water dish; which, by the bye, were placed closely contiguous to
the plate of the worthy archdeacon himself. Over and above this, on
a snow-white napkin, spread upon the sideboard, was a huge ham and a
huge sirloin; the latter having laden the dinner table on the previous
evening. Such was the ordinary fare at Plumstead Episcopi.

<p/>And yet I have never found the rectory a pleasant house. The
fact that man shall not live by bread alone seemed to be somewhat
forgotten; and noble as was the appearance of the host, and sweet and
good-natured as was the face of the hostess, talented as were the
children, and excellent as were the viands and the wines, in spite
of these attractions, I generally found the rectory somewhat dull.
After breakfast the archdeacon would retire, of course to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clerical
pursuits. Mrs Grantly, I presume, inspected her (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>) kitchen, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>)
had a first-rate housekeeper, with sixty pounds a year; and attended
to the lessons of Florinda and Grizzel, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Florinda</b></font>) had an excellent
governess with thirty pounds a year: but at any rate she (<font color='blue'><b>Florinda</b></font>) disappeared:
and I never could make companions of the boys. Charles James, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) always looked as though there was something in him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), never seemed to
have much to say; and what he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) did say he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) would always unsay the next
minute. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) told me once that he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) considered cricket, on the whole, to
be a gentleman-like game for boys, provided they would play without
running about; and that fives, also, was a seemly game, so that those
who played it never heated themselves. Henry once quarrelled with me
for taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sister Grizzel's part in a contest between them as to
the best mode of using a watering-pot for the garden flowers; and from
that day to this he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) has not spoken to me, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) speaks at me often
enough. For half an hour or so I certainly did like Sammy's gentle
speeches; but one gets tired of honey, and I found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) preferred
the more admiring listeners whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) met in the kitchen-garden and back
precincts of the establishment; besides, I think I once caught Sammy
fibbing.

<p/>On the whole, therefore, I found the rectory a dull house, though it
must be admitted that everything there was of the very best.

<p/>After breakfast, on the morning of which we are writing, the
archdeacon, as usual, retired to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) study, intimating that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) was
going to be very busy, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) would see Mr Chadwick if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) called.
On entering this sacred room he (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) carefully opened the paper case on
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) was wont to compose his (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) favourite sermons, and spread on it
a fair sheet of paper and one partly written on; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) then placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>)
inkstand, looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) pen, and folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) blotting paper; having
done so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) got up again from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) seat, stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) back to the
fire-place, and yawned comfortably, stretching out vastly his (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) huge
arms and opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) burly chest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) then walked across the room and
locked the door; and having so prepared himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) threw himself into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) easy-chair, took from a secret drawer beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) table a volume
of Rabelais, and began to amuse himself with the witty mischief of
Panurge; and so passed the archdeacon's morning on that day.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) was left undisturbed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) studies for an hour or two, when a
knock came to the door, and Mr Chadwick was announced. Rabelais
retired into the secret drawer, the easy-chair seemed knowingly to
betake itself off, and when the archdeacon quickly undid his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) bolt,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) was discovered by the steward working, as usual, for that church
of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) was so useful a pillar. Mr Chadwick had just come from
London, and was, therefore, known to be the bearer of important news.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've got Sir Abraham's opinion at last,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Chadwick/Chadwick</b></font>)</div>said Mr Chadwick, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>)
seated himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, well!''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the archdeacon impatiently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's as long as my arm,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the other; <div class="bookquote">``it can't be told in a
word, but you can read it;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) a copy, in heaven knows
how many spun-out folios, of the opinion which the attorney-general
had managed to cram on the back and sides of the case as originally
submitted to him (<font color='blue'><b>attorney-general</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The upshot is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Chadwick/Chadwick</b></font>)</div>said Chadwick, <div class="bookquote">``that there's a screw loose in their
case, and we had better do nothing. They are proceeding against Mr
Harding and myself, and Sir Abraham holds that, under the wording of
the will, and subsequent arrangements legally sanctioned, Mr Harding
and I are only paid servants. The defendants should have been either
the Corporation of Barchester, or possibly the chapter of your
father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Chadwick/Chadwick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``W-hoo!''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>said the archdeacon; <div class="bookquote">``so Master Bold is on the wrong scent,
is he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's Sir Abraham's opinion; but any scent almost would be a wrong
scent. Sir Abraham thinks that if they'd taken the corporation, or
the chapter, we could have baffled them. The bishop, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) thinks, would
be the surest shot; but even there we could plead that the bishop is
only a visitor, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) has never made himself a consenting party
to the performance of other duties.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's quite clear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>said the archdeacon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not quite so clear,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other. ``You see the will says, ``My
lord, the bishop, being graciously pleased to see that due justice
be done.<div class="bookquote">'' Now, it may be a question whether, in accepting and
administering the patronage, your father has not accepted also the
other duties assigned. It is doubtful, however; but even if they hit
that nail,--and they are far off from that yet,--the point is so nice,
as Sir Abraham says, that you would force them into fifteen thousand
pounds' cost before they could bring it to an issue! and where's that
sum of money to come from?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the bishop</b></font>)</div><p/>The archdeacon rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) hands with delight; he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) had never doubted the
justice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) case, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) had begun to have some dread of unjust
success on the part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) enemies. It was delightful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) thus to
hear that their cause was surrounded with such rocks and shoals; such
causes of shipwreck unseen by the landsman's eye, but visible enough
to the keen eyes of practical law mariners. How wrong his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) wife was to
wish that Bold should marry Eleanor! Bold! why, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) should be ass
enough to persevere, he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) would be a beggar before he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) knew whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) was
at law with!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's excellent, Chadwick;--that's excellent! I told you Sir
Abraham was the man for us;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) put down on the table the copy of
the opinion, and patted it fondly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you let that be seen, though, archdeacon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?--I!--not for worlds,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``People will talk, you know, archdeacon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because, if that gets abroad, it would teach them how to fight their
own battle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite true,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No one here in Barchester ought to see that but you and I,
archdeacon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, certainly no one else,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>said the archdeacon, pleased with the
closeness of the confidence; <div class="bookquote">``no one else shall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs Grantly is very interested in the matter, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Chadwick/Chadwick</b></font>)</div>said Mr
Chadwick.

<p/>Did the archdeacon wink, or did he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) not? I am inclined to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) did
not quite wink; but that without such, perhaps, unseemly gesture he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>)
communicated to Mr Chadwick, with the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) eye, intimation
that, deep as was Mrs Grantly's interest in the matter, it should not
procure for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>) a perusal of that document; and at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>)
partly opened the small drawer, above spoken of, deposited the paper
on the volume of Rabelais, and showed to Mr Chadwick the nature of the
key which guarded these hidden treasures. The careful steward then
expressed himself contented. Ah! vain man! he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could fasten up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
Rabelais, and other things secret, with all the skill of Bramah or
of Chubb; but where could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fasten up the key which solved these
mechanical mysteries? It is probable to us that the contents of
no drawer in that house were unknown to its mistress, and we think,
moreover, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was entitled to all such knowledge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Chadwick/Chadwick</b></font>)</div>said Mr Chadwick, <div class="bookquote">``we must, of course, tell your father and Mr
Harding so much of Sir Abraham's opinion as will satisfy them that the
matter is doing well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Chadwick/Chadwick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, certainly,--yes, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better let them know that Sir Abraham is of opinion that
there is no case at any rate against Mr Harding; and that as the
action is worded at present, it must fall to the ground; they must be
nonsuited, if they carry it on; you had better tell Mr Harding, that
Sir Abraham is clearly of opinion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) is only a servant, and as
such not liable;--or if you like it, I'll see Mr Harding myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I must see him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) to-morrow, and my father too, and I'll explain to
them exactly so much;--you won't go before lunch, Mr Chadwick: well,
if you will, you must, for I know your time is precious;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) shook
hands with the diocesan steward, and bowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) out.

<p/>The archdeacon had again recourse to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) drawer, and twice read
through the essence of Sir Abraham Haphazard's law-enlightened and
law-bewildered brains. It was very clear that to Sir Abraham, the
justice of the old men's claim or the justice of Mr Harding's defence
were ideas that had never presented themselves. A legal victory
over an opposing party was the service for which Sir Abraham was, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) imagined, to be paid; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>), according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) lights, had
diligently laboured to achieve, and with probable hope of success.
Of the intense desire which Mr Harding felt to be assured on fit
authority that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was wronging no man, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was entitled in true
equity to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) income, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) might sleep at night without pangs of
conscience, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was no robber, no spoiler of the poor; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) and
all the world might be openly convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was not the man which
_The Jupiter_ had described him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) to be; of such longings on the part of
Mr Harding, Sir Abraham was entirely ignorant; nor, indeed, could it
be looked on as part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) business to gratify such desires. Such
was not the system on which his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) battles were fought, and victories
gained. Success was his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) object, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) was generally successful.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) conquered his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) enemies by their weakness rather than by his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) own
strength, and it had been found almost impossible to make up a case
in which Sir Abraham, as an antagonist, would not find a flaw.

<p/>The archdeacon was delighted with the closeness of the reasoning. To
do him (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) justice, it was not a selfish triumph that he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) desired; he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) would
personally lose nothing by defeat, or at least what he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) might lose did
not actuate him (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>); but neither was it love of justice which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) so
anxious, nor even mainly solicitude for his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) father-in-law. He (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) was
fighting a part of a never-ending battle against a never-conquered
foe--that of the church against its enemies.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) knew Mr Harding could not pay all the expense of these doings: for
these long opinions of Sir Abraham's, these causes to be pleaded,
these speeches to be made, these various courts through which the case
was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) presumed, to be dragged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) father must
at least bear the heavier portion of this tremendous cost; but to do
the archdeacon justice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) did not recoil from this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) was a man
fond of obtaining money, greedy of a large income, but open-handed
enough in expending it, and it was a triumph to him (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) to foresee the
success of this measure, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) might be called on to pay so
dearly for it himself.




<p/>Chapter IX

<p/>THE CONFERENCE


<p/>On the following morning the archdeacon was with his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) father betimes,
and a note was sent down to the warden begging his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) attendance at the
palace. Dr Grantly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) cogitated on the matter, leaning back in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) brougham as he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) journeyed into Barchester, felt that it would be
difficult to communicate his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) own satisfaction either to his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) father or
his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) father-in-law. He (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) wanted success on his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) own side and discomfiture
on that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) enemies. The bishop wanted peace on the subject; a
settled peace if possible, but peace at any rate till the short
remainder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) own days had spun itself out. Mr Harding required
not only success and peace, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) also demanded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) might stand
justified before the world.

<p/>The bishop, however, was comparatively easy to deal with; and before
the arrival of the other, the dutiful son had persuaded his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father
that all was going on well, and then the warden arrived.

<p/>It was Mr Harding's wont, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) spent a morning at the palace,
to seat himself immediately at the bishop's elbow, the bishop
occupying a huge arm-chair fitted up with candle-sticks, a reading
table, a drawer, and other paraphernalia, the position of which
chair was never moved, summer or winter; and when, as was usual, the
archdeacon was there also, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) confronted the two elders, who thus were
enabled to fight the battle against him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) together;--and together submit
to defeat, for such was their constant fate.

<p/>Our warden now took his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) accustomed place, having greeted his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
son-in-law as he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) entered, and then affectionately inquired after his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
friend's health. There was a gentleness about the bishop to which the
soft womanly affection of Mr Harding particularly endeared itself, and
it was quaint to see how the two mild old priests pressed each other's
hand, and smiled and made little signs of love.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Abraham's opinion has come at last,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>began the archdeacon. Mr
Harding had heard so much, and was most anxious to know the result.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is quite favourable,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bishop</b></font>)</div>said the bishop, pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) friend's arm.
<div class="bookquote">``I am so glad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Harding looked at the mighty bearer of the important news for
confirmation of these glad tidings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>said the archdeacon; <div class="bookquote">``Sir Abraham has given most minute
attention to the case; indeed, I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) would;--most minute
attention; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) opinion is,--and as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) opinion on such a
subject being correct, no one who knows Sir Abraham's character can
doubt,--his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) opinion is, that they hav'n't got a leg to stand on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But as how, archdeacon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, in the first place:--but you're no lawyer, warden, and I doubt
you won't understand it; the gist of the matter is this:--under
Hiram's will two paid guardians have been selected for the hospital;
the law will say two paid servants, and you and I won't quarrel with
the name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate I will not if I am one of the servants,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div>said Mr Harding.
<div class="bookquote">``A rose, you know--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon impatient</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon impatient</b></font>)</div>said the archdeacon, impatient of poetry at such a time.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, two paid servants, we'll say; one to look after the men, and
the other to look after the money. You and Chadwick are these two
servants, and whether either of you be paid too much, or too little,
more or less in fact than the founder willed, it's as clear as
daylight that no one can fall foul of either of you for receiving an
allotted stipend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That does seem clear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bishop</b></font>)</div>said the bishop, who had winced visibly at the
words servants and stipend, which, however, appeared to have caused no
uneasiness to the archdeacon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite clear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and very satisfactory. In point of fact, it
being necessary to select such servants for the use of the hospital,
the pay to be given to them must depend on the rate of pay for such
services, according to their market value at the period in question;
and those who manage the hospital must be the only judges of this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And who does manage the hospital?''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>asked the warden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, let them find that out; that's another question: the action is
brought against you and Chadwick; that's your defence, and a perfect and
full defence it is. Now that I think very satisfactory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bishop</b></font>)</div>said the bishop, looking inquiringly up into his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) friend's
face, who sat silent awhile, and apparently not so well satisfied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And conclusive,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>continued the archdeacon; <div class="bookquote">``if they press it to a
jury, which they won't do, no twelve men in England will take five
minutes to decide against them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But according to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div>said Mr Harding, <div class="bookquote">``I might as well have sixteen
hundred a year as eight, if the managers choose to allot it to me; and
as I am one of the managers, if not the chief manager, myself, that
can hardly be a just arrangement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well; all that's nothing to the question. The question is,
whether this intruding fellow, and a lot of cheating attorneys and
pestilent dissenters, are to interfere with an arrangement which
everyone knows is essentially just and serviceable to the church.
Pray don't let us be splitting hairs, and that amongst ourselves, or
there'll never be an end of the cause or the cost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Harding again sat silent for a while, during which the bishop once
and again pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) arm, and looked in his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) face to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) could
catch a gleam of a contented and eased mind; but there was no such
gleam, and the poor warden continued playing sad dirges on invisible
stringed instruments in all manner of positions; he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) was ruminating in
his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) mind on this opinion of Sir Abraham, looking to it wearily and
earnestly for satisfaction, but finding none. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Did
you see the opinion, archdeacon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The archdeacon said he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had not,--that was to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had,--that was,
he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had not seen the opinion itself; he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had seen what had been called a
copy, but he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) could not say whether of a whole or part; nor could he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
say that what he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had seen were the _ipsissima verba_ of the great man
himself; but what he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had seen contained exactly the decision which he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
had announced, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) again declared to be to his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) mind extremely
satisfactory.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to see the opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>said the warden; <div class="bookquote">``that is, a copy
of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I suppose you can if you make a point of it; but I don't see
the use myself; of course it is essential that the purport of it
should not be known, and it is therefore unadvisable to multiply
copies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should it not be known?''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>asked the warden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a question for a man to ask!''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>said the archdeacon, throwing up
his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) hands in token of his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) surprise; <div class="bookquote">``but it is like you:--a child is
not more innocent than you are in matters of business. Can't you see
that if we tell them that no action will lie against you, but that one
may possibly lie against some other person or persons, that we shall
be putting weapons into their hands, and be teaching them how to cut
our own throats?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div><p/>The warden again sat silent, and the bishop again looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
wistfully. <div class="bookquote">``The only thing we have now to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>continued the
archdeacon, <div class="bookquote">``is to remain quiet, hold our peace, and let them play
their own game as they please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are not to make known then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>said the warden, <div class="bookquote">``that we have
consulted the attorney-general, and that we are advised by him (<font color='blue'><b>attorney-general</b></font>) that
the founder's will is fully and fairly carried out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless my soul!''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>said the archdeacon, <div class="bookquote">``how odd it is that you will
not see that all we are to do is to do nothing: why should we say
anything about the founder's will? We are in possession; and we know
that they are not in a position to put us out; surely that is enough
for the present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Harding rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) seat and paced thoughtfully up and down the
library, the bishop the while watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) painfully at every turn,
and the archdeacon continuing to pour forth his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) convictions that the
affair was in a state to satisfy any prudent mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And _The Jupiter_?''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>said the warden, stopping suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! _The Jupiter_,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered the other. <div class="bookquote">''_The Jupiter_ can break no
bones. You must bear with that; there is much, of course, which it
is our bounden duty to bear; it cannot be all roses for us here,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>and
the archdeacon looked exceedingly moral; <div class="bookquote">``besides, the matter is too
trivial, of too little general interest to be mentioned again in _The
Jupiter_, unless we stir up the subject.''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>And the archdeacon again
looked exceedingly knowing and worldly wise.

<p/>The warden continued his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) walk; the hard and stinging words of that
newspaper article, each one of which had thrust a thorn as it were
into his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) inmost soul, were fresh in his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) memory; he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had read it more
than once, word by word, and what was worse, he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) fancied it was as well
known to everyone as to himself. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) to be looked on as the unjust
griping priest he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had been there described? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) to be pointed at
as the consumer of the bread of the poor, and to be allowed no means
of refuting such charges, of clearing his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) begrimed name, of standing
innocent in the world, as hitherto he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had stood? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) to bear all
this, to receive as usual his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) now hated income, and be known as one
of those greedy priests who by their rapacity have brought disgrace
on their church? And why? Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) bear all this? Why should
he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) die, for he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) could not live, under such a weight of
obloquy? As he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) paced up and down the room he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) resolved in his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) misery
and enthusiasm that he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) could with pleasure, if he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) were allowed, give
up his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) place, abandon his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) pleasant home, leave the hospital, and live
poorly, happily, and with an unsullied name, on the small remainder of
his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) means.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) was a man somewhat shy of speaking of himself, even before those
who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) best, and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) loved the most; but at last it burst
forth from him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>), and with a somewhat jerking eloquence he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) declared that
he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) could not, would not, bear this misery any longer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it can be proved,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) at last, <div class="bookquote">``that I have a just and honest
right to this, as God well knows I always deemed I had; if this salary
or stipend be really my due, I am not less anxious than another to
retain it. I have the well-being of my child to look to. I am too
old to miss without some pain the comforts to which I have been used;
and I am, as others are, anxious to prove to the world that I have
been right, and to uphold the place I have held; but I cannot do it
at such a cost as this. I cannot bear this. Could you tell me to do
so?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) appealed, almost in tears, to the bishop, who had left
his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) chair, and was now leaning on the warden's arm as he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) stood on the
further side of the table facing the archdeacon. <div class="bookquote">``Could you tell me
to sit there at ease, indifferent, and satisfied, while such things as
these are said loudly of me in the world?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The bishop</b></font>)</div><p/>The bishop could feel for him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) and sympathise with him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) could
not advise him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) could only say, <div class="bookquote">``No, no, you shall be asked to
do nothing that is painful; you shall do just what your heart tells
you to be right; you shall do whatever you think best yourself.
Theophilus, don't advise him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), pray don't advise the warden to do
anything which is painful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But the archdeacon, though he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) could not sympathise, could advise;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) saw that the time had come when it behoved him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) to do so in a
somewhat peremptory manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) said, speaking to his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) father;--and when he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) called
his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) father <div class="bookquote">``my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>the good old bishop shook in his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) shoes, for he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
knew that an evil time was coming. <div class="bookquote">``Why, my lord, there are two ways
of giving advice: there is advice that may be good for the present
day; and there is advice that may be good for days to come: now I
cannot bring myself to give the former, if it be incompatible with the
other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no, I suppose not,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bishop</b></font>)</div>said the bishop, re-seating himself, and
shading his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) hands. Mr Harding sat down with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) back to
the further wall, playing to himself some air fitted for so calamitous
an occasion, and the archdeacon said out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) say standing, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
back to the empty fire-place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not to be supposed but that much pain will spring out of this
unnecessarily raised question. We must all have foreseen that, and
the matter has in no wise gone on worse than we expected; but it will
be weak, yes, and wicked also, to abandon the cause and own ourselves
wrong, because the inquiry is painful. It is not only ourselves we
have to look to; to a certain extent the interest of the church is in
our keeping. Should it be found that one after another of those who
hold preferment abandoned it whenever it might be attacked, is it
not plain that such attacks would be renewed till nothing was left
us? and, that if so deserted, the Church of England must fall to
the ground altogether? If this be true of many, it is true of one.
Were you, accused as you now are, to throw up the wardenship, and to
relinquish the preferment which is your property, with the vain object
of proving yourself disinterested, you would fail in that object, you
would inflict a desperate blow on your brother clergymen, you would
encourage every cantankerous dissenter in England to make a similar
charge against some source of clerical revenue, and you would do your
best to dishearten those who are most anxious to defend you and uphold
your position. I can fancy nothing more weak, or more wrong. It is
not that you think that there is any justice in these charges, or that
you doubt your own right to the wardenship: you are convinced of your
own honesty, and yet would yield to them through cowardice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cowardice!''  (<font color='red'><b>the bishop</b></font>)</div>said the bishop, expostulating. Mr Harding sat unmoved,
gazing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) son-in-law.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; would it not be cowardice? Would he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) not do so because he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) is
afraid to endure the evil things which will be falsely spoken of him (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)?
Would that not be cowardice? And now let us see the extent of the
evil which you dread. The _Jupiter_ publishes an article which a
great many, no doubt, will read; but of those who understand the
subject how many will believe _The Jupiter_? Everyone knows what its
object is: it has taken up the case against Lord Guildford and against
the Dean of Rochester, and that against half a dozen bishops; and does
not everyone know that it would take up any case of the kind, right
or wrong, false or true, with known justice or known injustice, if by
doing so it could further its own views? Does not all the world know
this of _The Jupiter_? Who that really knows you will think the worse
of you for what _The Jupiter_ says? And why care for those who do not
know you? I will say nothing of your own comfort, but I do say that
you could not be justified in throwing up, in a fit of passion, for
such it would be, the only maintenance that Eleanor has; and if you
did so, if you really did vacate the wardenship, and submit to ruin,
what would that profit you? If you have no future right to the
income, you have had no past right to it; and the very fact of your
abandoning your position would create a demand for repayment of that
which you have already received and spent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The warden</b></font>)</div><p/>The poor warden groaned as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) sat perfectly still, looking up at the
hard-hearted orator who thus tormented him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), and the bishop echoed the
sound faintly from behind his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) hands; but the archdeacon cared little
for such signs of weakness, and completed his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) exhortation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But let us suppose the office to be left vacant, and that your own
troubles concerning it were over; would that satisfy you? Are your
only aspirations in the matter confined to yourself and family? I
know they are not. I know you are as anxious as any of us for the
church to which we belong; and what a grievous blow would such an act
of apostasy give her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)! You owe it to the church of which you are a
member and a minister, to bear with this affliction, however severe it
may be: you owe it to my father, who instituted you, to support his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
rights: you owe it to those who preceded you to assert the legality
of their position; you owe it to those who are to come after you, to
maintain uninjured for them that which you received uninjured from
others; and you owe to us all the unflinching assistance of perfect
brotherhood in this matter, so that upholding one another we may
support our great cause without blushing and without disgrace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div><p/>And so the archdeacon ceased, and stood self-satisfied, watching the
effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) spoken wisdom.

<p/>The warden felt himself, to a certain extent, stifled; he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) would have
given the world to get himself out into the open air without speaking
to, or noticing those who were in the room with him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>); but this was
impossible. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) could not leave without saying something, and he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) felt
himself confounded by the archdeacon's eloquence. There was a heavy,
unfeeling, unanswerable truth in what he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) had said; there was so much
practical, but odious common sense in it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) neither knew how
to assent or to differ. If it were necessary for him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) to suffer, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) could endure without complaint and without cowardice,
providing that he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was self-satisfied of the justice of his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) own cause.
What he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) could not endure was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) should be accused by others, and
not acquitted by himself. Doubting, as he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) had begun to doubt, the
justice of his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) own position in the hospital, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) own
self-confidence would not be restored because Mr Bold had been in
error as to some legal form; nor could he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) be satisfied to escape,
because, through some legal fiction, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) who received the greatest
benefit from the hospital might be considered only as one of its
servants.

<p/>The archdeacon's speech had silenced him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>),--stupefied him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>),--annihilated
him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>); anything but satisfied him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>). With the bishop it fared not much
better. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) did not discern clearly how things were, but he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) saw enough
to know that a battle was to be prepared for; a battle that would
destroy his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) few remaining comforts, and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) with sorrow to the
grave.

<p/>The warden still sat, and still looked at the archdeacon, till his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
thoughts fixed themselves wholly on the means of escape from his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
present position, and he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) felt like a bird fascinated by gazing on a
snake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you agree with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>said the archdeacon at last, breaking the
dread silence; <div class="bookquote">``my lord, I hope you agree with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, what a sigh the bishop gave! <div class="bookquote">``My lord, I hope you agree with me,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the tyrant</b></font>)</div>again repeated the merciless tyrant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I suppose so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>groaned the poor old man, slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you, warden?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Harding was now stirred to action;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) must speak and move, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
got up and took one turn before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not press me for an answer just at present; I will do nothing
lightly in the matter, and of whatever I do I will give you and the
bishop notice.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And so without another word he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) leave,
escaping quickly through the palace hall, and down the lofty steps;
nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) breathe freely till he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) found himself alone under the huge
elms of the silent close. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) walked long and slowly, thinking
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) case with a troubled air, and trying in vain to confute the
archdeacon's argument. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) then went home, resolved to bear it
all,--ignominy, suspense, disgrace, self-doubt, and heart-burning,--
and to do as those would have him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), who he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) still believed were most fit
and most able to counsel him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) aright.




<p/>Chapter X

<p/>TRIBULATION


<p/>Mr Harding was a sadder man than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had ever yet been when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) returned
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) own house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had been wretched enough on that well-remembered
morning when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was forced to expose before his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) son-in-law the
publisher's account for ushering into the world his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) dear book
of sacred music: when after making such payments as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) could do
unassisted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was a debtor of more than three hundred
pounds; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) sufferings then were as nothing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) present
misery;--then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had done wrong, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) knew it, and was able to
resolve that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) would not sin in like manner again; but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) could
make no resolution, and comfort himself by no promises of firmness.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had been forced to think that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) lot had placed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) in a false
position, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was about to maintain that position against the
opinion of the world and against his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) own convictions.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had read with pity, amounting almost to horror, the strictures
which had appeared from time to time against the Earl of Guildford as
master of St Cross, and the invectives that had been heaped on rich
diocesan dignitaries and overgrown sinecure pluralists. In judging of
them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) judged leniently; the whole bias of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) profession had taught
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) to think that they were more sinned against than sinning, and
that the animosity with which they had been pursued was venomous
and unjust; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) had not the less regarded their plight as most
miserable. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) hair had stood on end and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) flesh had crept as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) read the things which had been written; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) had wondered how men
could live under such a load of disgrace; how they could face their
fellow-creatures while their names were bandied about so injuriously
and so publicly;--and now this lot was to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>),--he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>), that shy,
retiring man, who had so comforted himself in the hidden obscurity of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) lot, who had so enjoyed the unassuming warmth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) own little
corner,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) was now dragged forth into the glaring day, and gibbeted
before ferocious multitudes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) own house a crestfallen,
humiliated man, without a hope of overcoming the wretchedness which
affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) wandered into the drawing-room where was his (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) daughter; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) could
not speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) now, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) left it, and went into the book-room.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) was not quick enough to escape Eleanor's glance, or to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
from seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) was disturbed; and in a little while she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) followed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) seated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) accustomed chair with no book open
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>), no pen ready in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) hand, no ill-shapen notes of blotted
music lying before him (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) as was usual, none of those hospital accounts
with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) was so precise and yet so unmethodical: he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) was doing
nothing, thinking of nothing, looking at nothing; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) was merely
suffering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave me, Eleanor, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``leave me, my darling, for a
few minutes, for I am busy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Eleanor saw well how it was, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) did leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>), and glided
silently back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) drawing-room. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) had sat a while, thus
alone and unoccupied, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) got up to walk again;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) could make more
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) thoughts walking than sitting, and was creeping out into his (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>)
garden, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) met Bunce on the threshold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Bunce,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>), in a tone that for him (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) was sharp, <div class="bookquote">``what is it?
do you want me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was only coming to ask after your reverence,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the old
bedesman, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) hat; <div class="bookquote">``and to inquire about the news from
London,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) added after a pause.

<p/>The warden winced, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) forehead and felt
bewildered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Attorney Finney has been there this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bunce/Mr Bunce</b></font>)</div>continued Bunce, <div class="bookquote">``and
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Finney</b></font>) looks I guess he (<font color='blue'><b>Finney</b></font>) is not so well pleased as he (<font color='blue'><b>Finney</b></font>) once was, and it
has got abroad somehow that the archdeacon has had down great news
from London, and Handy and Moody are both as black as devils. And I
hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bunce/Mr Bunce</b></font>)</div>said the man, trying to assume a cheery tone, <div class="bookquote">``that things are
looking up, and that there'll be an end soon to all this stuff which
bothers your reverence so sorely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I wish there may be, Bunce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But about the news, your reverence?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, almost
whispering.

<p/>Mr Harding walked on, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) head impatiently. Poor Bunce
little knew how he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) was tormenting his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) patron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If there was anything to cheer you, I should be so glad to know it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>), with a tone of affection which the warden in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) misery
could not resist.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) stopped, and took both the old man's hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``My friend,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``my dear old friend, there is nothing; there is no news to
cheer me;--God's will be done'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>: and two small hot tears broke away
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) eyes and stole down his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) furrowed cheeks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then God's will be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>said the other solemnly; <div class="bookquote">``but they told
me that there was good news from London, and I came to wish your
reverence joy; but God's will be done;''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>and so the warden again walked
on, and the bedesman, looking wistfully after him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) and receiving no
encouragement to follow, returned sadly to his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) own abode.

<p/>For a couple of hours the warden remained thus in the garden, now
walking, now standing motionless on the turf, and then, as his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) legs
got weary, sitting unconsciously on the garden seats, and then walking
again. And Eleanor, hidden behind the muslin curtains of the window,
watched him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) through the trees as he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) now came in sight, and then again
was concealed by the turnings of the walk; and thus the time passed
away till five, when the warden crept back to the house and prepared
for dinner.

<p/>It was but a sorry meal. The demure parlour-maid, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) handed the
dishes and changed the plates, saw that all was not right, and was
more demure than ever: neither father nor daughter could eat, and the
hateful food was soon cleared away, and the bottle of port placed upon
the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you like Bunce to come in, papa?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Harding/ELEANOR</b></font>)</div>said Eleanor, thinking that
the company of the old man might lighten his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sorrow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear, thank you, not to-day; but are not you going out,
Eleanor, this lovely afternoon? don't stay in for me, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you seemed so sad, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), irritated; <div class="bookquote">``well, people must all have their share of
sadness here; I am not more exempt than another: but kiss me, dearest,
and go now; I will, if possible, be more sociable when you return.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And Eleanor was again banished from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father's sorrow. Ah! her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
desire now was not to find him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) happy, but to be allowed to share his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
sorrows; not to force him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be sociable, but to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be
trustful.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) bonnet as desired, and went up to Mary Bold; this was
now her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) daily haunt, for John Bold was up in London among lawyers and
church reformers, diving deep into other questions than that of the
wardenship of Barchester; supplying information to one member of
Parliament, and dining with another; subscribing to funds for the
abolition of clerical incomes, and seconding at that great national
meeting at the Crown and Anchor a resolution to the effect, that no
clergyman of the Church of England, be he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) who he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) might, should have
more than a thousand a year, and none less than two hundred and fifty.
His (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) speech on this occasion was short, for fifteen had to speak, and
the room was hired for two hours only, at the expiration of which
the Quakers and Mr Cobden were to make use of it for an appeal to
the public in aid of the Emperor of Russia; but it was sharp and
effective; at least he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) was told so by a companion with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) now
lived much, and on whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) greatly depended,--one Tom Towers, a very
leading genius, and supposed to have high employment on the staff of
_The Jupiter_.

<p/>So Eleanor, as was now her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) wont, went up to Mary Bold, and Mary
listened kindly, while the daughter spoke much of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father, and,
perhaps kinder still, found a listener in Eleanor, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) spoke
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) brother. In the meantime the warden sat alone, leaning on
the arm of his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) chair; he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had poured out a glass of wine, but had done
so merely from habit, for he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) left it untouched; there he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) sat gazing
at the open window, and thinking, if he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) can be said to have thought,
of the happiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) past life. All manner of past delights came
before his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) mind, which at the time he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had enjoyed without considering
them; his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) easy days, his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) absence of all kind of hard work, his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
pleasant shady home, those twelve old neighbours whose welfare till
now had been the source of so much pleasant care, the excellence
of his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) children, the friendship of the dear old bishop, the solemn
grandeur of those vaulted aisles, through which he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) loved to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
own voice pealing; and then that friend of friends, that choice ally
that had never deserted him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>), that eloquent companion that would
always, when asked, discourse such pleasant music, that violoncello
of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>);--ah, how happy he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had been! but it was over now; his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) easy
days and absence of work had been the crime which brought on him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
tribulation; his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) shady home was pleasant no longer; maybe it was no
longer his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>); the old neighbours, whose welfare had been so desired by
him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), were his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) enemies; his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) daughter was as wretched as himself; and
even the bishop was made miserable by his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) position. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) could never
again lift up his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) voice boldly as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had hitherto done among his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
brethren, for he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was disgraced; and he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) feared even to
touch his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) bow, for he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) knew how grievous a sound of wailing, how
piteous a lamentation, it would produce.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was still sitting in the same chair and the same posture, having
hardly moved a limb for two hours, when Eleanor came back to tea, and
succeeded in bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) into the drawing-room.

<p/>The tea seemed as comfortless as the dinner, though the warden, who
had hitherto eaten nothing all day, devoured the plateful of bread and
butter, unconscious of what he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) was doing.

<p/>Eleanor had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) mind to force him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
hardly knew how to commence: she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) must wait till the urn was gone, till
the servant would no longer be coming in and out.

<p/>At last everything was gone, and the drawing-room door was permanently
closed; then Eleanor, getting up and going round to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father, put
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) arm round his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) neck, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Papa, won't you tell me what it
is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What what is, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This new sorrow that torments you; I know you are unhappy, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``New sorrow! it's no new sorrow, my dear; we have all our cares
sometimes;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tried to smile, but it was a ghastly failure; <div class="bookquote">``but
I shouldn't be so dull a companion; come, we'll have some music.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, papa, not tonight,--it would only trouble you tonight;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
sat upon his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knee, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) sometimes would in their gayest moods, and
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) arm round his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) neck, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Papa, I will not leave you
till you talk to me; oh, if you only knew how much good it would do
to you, to tell me of it all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The father kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter, and pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heart; but
still he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said nothing: it was so hard to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own
sorrows; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was so shy a man even with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own child!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa, do tell me what it is; I know it is about the hospital, and
what they are doing up in London, and what that cruel newspaper has
said; but if there be such cause for sorrow, let us be sorrowful
together; we are all in all to each other now: dear, dear papa, do
speak to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Harding could not well speak now, for the warm tears were running
down his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) cheeks like rain in May, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) child close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
heart, and squeezed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) hand as a lover might, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
forehead and his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) wet cheeks, and lay upon his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) bosom, and comforted him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
as a woman only can do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My own child,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) said, as soon as his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) tears would let him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) speak, <div class="bookquote">``my
own, own child, why should you too be unhappy before it is necessary?
It may come to that, that we must leave this place, but till that time
comes, why should your young days be clouded?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is that all, papa? If that be all, let us leave it, and have
light hearts elsewhere: if that be all, let us go. Oh, papa, you and
I could be happy if we had only bread to eat, so long as our hearts
were light.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Harding/ELEANOR</b></font>)</div><p/>And Eleanor's face was lighted up with enthusiasm as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
father how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might banish all his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) care; and a gleam of joy shot
across his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brow as this idea of escape again presented itself, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) again fancied for a moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could spurn away from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) the
income which the world envied him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could give the lie to that
wielder of the tomahawk who had dared to write such things of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in
_The Jupiter_; that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could leave Sir Abraham, and the archdeacon,
and Bold, and the rest of them with their lawsuit among them, and
wipe his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hands altogether of so sorrow-stirring a concern. Ah, what
happiness might there be in the distance, with Eleanor and him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in some
small cottage, and nothing left of their former grandeur but their
music! Yes, they would walk forth with their music books, and their
instruments, and shaking the dust from off their feet as they went,
leave the ungrateful place. Never did a poor clergyman sigh for a warm
benefice more anxiously than our warden did now to be rid of his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give it up, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) said again, jumping from his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) knees and
standing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) feet before him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>), looking boldly into his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) face; <div class="bookquote">``give
it up, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, it was sad to see how that momentary gleam of joy passed away;
how the look of hope was dispersed from that sorrowful face, as the
remembrance of the archdeacon came back upon our poor warden, and he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
reflected that he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) could not stir from his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) now hated post. He (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) was as
a man bound with iron, fettered with adamant: he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) was in no respect a
free agent; he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had no choice. <div class="bookquote">``Give it up!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Oh if he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) only could:
what an easy way that were out of all his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) troubles!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa, don't doubt about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) continued, thinking that his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
hesitation arose from his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) unwillingness to abandon so comfortable
a home; <div class="bookquote">``is it on my account that you would stay here? Do you
think that I cannot be happy without a pony-carriage and a fine
drawing-room? Papa, I never can be happy here, as long as there is a
question as to your honour in staying here; but I could be gay as the
day is long in the smallest tiny little cottage, if I could see you
come in and go out with a light heart. Oh! papa, your face tells so
much; though you won't speak to me with your voice, I know how it is
with you every time I look at you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>How he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) heart again with almost a spasmodic
pressure! How he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) as the tears fell like rain from his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) old
eyes! How he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) blessed her (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>), and called her (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) by a hundred soft sweet
names which now came new to his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) lips! How he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) chid himself for ever
having been unhappy with such a treasure in his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) house, such a jewel on
his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) bosom, with so sweet a flower in the choice garden of his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) heart!
And then the floodgates of his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) tongue were loosed, and, at length,
with unsparing detail of circumstances, he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) all that he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
wished, and all that he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) could not do. He (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) repeated those arguments
of the archdeacon, not agreeing in their truth, but explaining his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
inability to escape from them;--how it had been declared to him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) that
he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) was bound to remain where he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) was by the interests of his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) order,
by gratitude to the bishop, by the wishes of his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) friends, by a sense
of duty, which, though he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) could not understand it, he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) was fain to
acknowledge. He (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had been accused of cowardice, and
though he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) was not a man to make much of such a charge before the
world, now in the full candour of his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) that
such an accusation was grievous to him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>); that he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) did think it would be
unmanly to desert his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) post, merely to escape his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) present sufferings,
and that, therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) must bear as best he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) might the misery which
was prepared for him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>).

<p/>And did she (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) find these details tedious? Oh, no; she (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
to dilate on every feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) expressed, till he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) laid bare the inmost
corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) heart to her (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>). They spoke together of the archdeacon,
as two children might of a stern, unpopular, but still respected
schoolmaster, and of the bishop as a parent kind as kind could be, but
powerless against an omnipotent pedagogue.

<p/>And then when they had discussed all this, when the father had told
all to the child, she (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) could not be less confiding than he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been;
and as John Bold's name was mentioned between them, she (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) owned how well
she (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had learned to love him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),--<div class="bookquote">``had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) once,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
would not, could not do so now--no, even had her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) troth been plighted
to him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would have taken it back again;--had she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sworn to love
him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) wife, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would have discarded him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), and not felt herself
forsworn, when he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) proved himself the enemy of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But the warden declared that Bold was no enemy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>), and encouraged
her (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) love; and gently rebuked, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>), the stern resolve she (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
had made to cast him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) off; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) of happier days
when their trials would all be over; and declared that her (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) young heart
should not be torn asunder to please either priest or prelate, dean or
archdeacon. No, not if all Oxford were to convocate together, and
agree as to the necessity of the sacrifice.

<p/>And so they greatly comforted each other;--and in what sorrow will not
such mutual confidence give consolation!--and with a last expression
of tender love they parted, and went comparatively happy to their
rooms.




<p/>Chapter XI

<p/>IPHIGENIA


<p/>When Eleanor laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) head on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) pillow that night, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) mind was
anxiously intent on some plan by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) might extricate her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father
from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) misery; and, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) warm-hearted enthusiasm, self-sacrifice
was decided on as the means to be adopted. Was not so good an
Agamemnon worthy of an Iphigenia? She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) would herself personally
implore John Bold to desist from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) undertaking; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) would explain to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father's sorrows, the cruel misery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) position; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) would
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) how her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father would die if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) were thus dragged before the
public and exposed to such unmerited ignominy; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) would appeal to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
old friendship, to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) generosity, to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) manliness, to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mercy; if
need were, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) would kneel to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for the favour she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) would ask; but
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) did this the idea of love must be banished. There must be
no bargain in the matter. To his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mercy, to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) generosity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) could
appeal; but as a pure maiden, hitherto even unsolicited, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) could not
appeal to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) love, nor under such circumstances could she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) allow him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
to do so. Of course, when so provoked he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would declare his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) passion;
that was to be expected; there had been enough between them to make
such a fact sure; but it was equally certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must be rejected.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) could not be understood as saying, Make my father free and I
am the reward. There would be no sacrifice in that;--not so had
Jephthah's daughter saved her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father;--not so could she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) show to
that kindest, dearest of parents how much she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was able to bear for
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) good. No; to one resolve must her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) whole soul be bound; and so
resolving, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could make her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) great request to Bold
with as much self-assured confidence as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could have done to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
grandfather.

<p/>And now I own I have fears for my heroine; not as to the upshot of her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>)
mission,--not in the least as to that; as to the full success of her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>)
generous scheme, and the ultimate result of such a project, no one
conversant with human nature and novels can have a doubt; but as to
the amount of sympathy she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) may receive from those of her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) own sex.
Girls below twenty and old ladies above sixty will do her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) justice; for
in the female heart the soft springs of sweet romance reopen after
many years, and again gush out with waters pure as in earlier days,
and greatly refresh the path that leads downwards to the grave.
But I fear that the majority of those between these two eras will
not approve of Eleanor's plan. I fear that unmarried ladies of
thirty-five will declare that there can be no probability of so absurd
a project being carried through; that young women on their knees
before their lovers are sure to get kissed, and that they would not
put themselves in such a position did they not expect it; that Eleanor
is going to Bold only because circumstances prevent Bold from coming
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>); that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) is certainly a little fool, or a little schemer, but
that in all probability she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) is thinking a good deal more about herself
than her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father.

<p/>Dear ladies, you are right as to your appreciation of the
circumstances, but very wrong as to Miss Harding's character. Miss
Harding was much younger than you are, and could not, therefore, know,
as you may do, to what dangers such an encounter might expose her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) may get kissed; I think it very probable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) will; but I give
my solemn word and positive assurance, that the remotest idea of such
a catastrophe never occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) made the great resolve now
alluded to.

<p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) slept; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) rose refreshed; and met her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) father
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) kindest embrace and most loving smiles; and on the whole
their breakfast was by no means so triste as had been their dinner the
day before; and then, making some excuse to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) father for so soon
leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) started on the commencement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) operations.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) knew that John Bold was in London, and that, therefore, the scene
itself could not be enacted to-day; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) also knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) was soon
to be home, probably on the next day, and it was necessary that some
little plan for meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) should be concerted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) sister Mary.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) got up to the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went, as usual, into the morning
sitting-room, and was startled by perceiving, by a stick, a greatcoat,
and sundry parcels which were lying about, that Bold must already have
returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``John has come back so suddenly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Bold</b></font>)</div>said Mary, coming into the room; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
has been travelling all night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Bold</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll come up again some other time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Harding/ELEANOR</b></font>)</div>said Eleanor, about to beat
a retreat in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) sudden dismay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'s out now, and will be for the next two hours,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other;
<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'s with that horrid Finney; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) only came to see him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) returns
by the mail train tonight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Harding/ELEANOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Returns by the mail train tonight, thought Eleanor to herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
strove to screw up her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) courage;--away again tonight;--then it must be
now or never; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) again sat down, having risen to go.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) wished the ordeal could have been postponed: she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had fully made
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) mind to do the deed, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had not made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) mind to do it
this very day; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) felt ill at ease, astray, and in
difficulty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``I must see your brother before he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) goes back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the other; <div class="bookquote">``I know he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'ll be delighted to see
you;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) tried to treat it as a matter of course, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was not
the less surprised; for Mary and Eleanor had daily talked over John
Bold and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) conduct, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) love, and Mary would insist on calling
Eleanor her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sister, and would scold her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) for not calling Bold by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>)
Christian name; and Eleanor would half confess her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) love, but like a
modest maiden would protest against such familiarities even with the
name of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) lover; and so they talked hour after hour, and Mary Bold,
who was much the elder, looked forward with happy confidence to the
day when Eleanor would not be ashamed to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
was, however, fully sure that just at present Eleanor would be much
more likely to avoid her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) brother than to seek him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary, I must see your brother, now, to-day, and beg from him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) a great
favour;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) spoke with a solemn air, not at all usual to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>);
and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) went on, and opened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) friend all her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) plan, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
well-weighed scheme for saving her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father from a sorrow which would,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) said, if it lasted, bring him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grave. <div class="bookquote">``But, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
continued, <div class="bookquote">``you must now, you know, cease any joking about me and Mr
Bold; you must now say no more about that; I am not ashamed to beg
this favour from your brother, but when I have done so, there can
never be anything further between us;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and this she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) said with a staid
and solemn air, quite worthy of Jephthah's daughter or of Iphigenia
either.

<p/>It was quite clear that Mary Bold did not follow the argument. That
Eleanor Harding should appeal, on behalf of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) father, to Bold's
better feelings seemed to Mary quite natural; it seemed quite natural
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) should relent, overcome by such filial tears, and by so much
beauty; but, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thinking, it was at any rate equally natural, that
having relented, John should put his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) arm round his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mistress's waist,
and say: <div class="bookquote">``Now having settled that, let us be man and wife, and all
will end happily!''  (<font color='red'><b>mistress</b></font>)</div>Why his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) good nature should not be rewarded, when
such reward would operate to the disadvantage of none, Mary, who had
more sense than romance, could not understand; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said as much.

<p/>Eleanor, however, was firm, and made quite an eloquent speech to
support her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) own view of the question: she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) could not condescend, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
said, to ask such a favour on any other terms than those proposed.
Mary might, perhaps, think her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) high-flown, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own ideas,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not submit to sacrifice her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) self-respect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am sure you love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>);--don't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Bold</b></font>)</div>pleaded Mary; <div class="bookquote">``and I am sure
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loves you better than anything in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Bold</b></font>)</div><p/>Eleanor was going to make another speech, but a tear came to each eye,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) could not; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) pretended to blow her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) nose, and walked to
the window, and made a little inward call on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) own courage, and
finding herself somewhat sustained, said sententiously: <div class="bookquote">``Mary, this
is nonsense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you do love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Bold</b></font>)</div>said Mary, who had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) friend to the
window, and now spoke with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) arms close wound round the other's
waist. <div class="bookquote">``You do love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with all your heart,--you know you do; I defy
you to deny it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Harding/ELEANOR</b></font>)</div>commenced Eleanor, turning sharply round to refute the charge;
but the intended falsehood stuck in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) throat, and never came to
utterance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) could not deny her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) love, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) took plentifully
to tears, and leant upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) friend's bosom and sobbed there, and
protested that, love or no love, it would make no difference in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
resolve, and called Mary, a thousand times, the most cruel of girls,
and swore her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to secrecy by a hundred oaths, and ended by declaring
that the girl who could betray her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) friend's love, even to a brother,
would be as black a traitor as a soldier in a garrison who should
open the city gates to the enemy. While they were yet discussing the
matter, Bold returned, and Eleanor was forced into sudden action: she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
had either to accomplish or abandon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) plan; and having slipped into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) friend's bedroom, as the gentleman closed the hall door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
washed the marks of tears from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) eyes, and resolved within herself
to go through with it. <div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) I am here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and coming
in; and mind, whatever you do, don't leave us.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So Mary informed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
brother, with a somewhat sombre air, that Miss Harding was in the next
room, and was coming to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).

<p/>Eleanor was certainly thinking more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father than herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
arranged her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) hair before the glass, and removed the traces of sorrow
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) face; and yet I should be untrue if I said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was not
anxious to appear well before her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) lover: why else was she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) so sedulous
with that stubborn curl that would rebel against her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) hand, and smooth
so eagerly her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) ruffled ribands? why else did she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) damp her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) eyes to
dispel the redness, and bite her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) pretty lips to bring back the colour?
Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was anxious to look her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) best, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was but a mortal
angel after all. But had she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) been immortal, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) flitted back to
the sitting-room on a cherub's wings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) could not have had a more
faithful heart, or a truer wish to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father at any cost to
herself.

<p/>John Bold had not met her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) since the day when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) in dudgeon
in the cathedral close. Since then his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) whole time had been occupied
in promoting the cause against her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father, and not unsuccessfully.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) had often thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), and turned over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) mind a hundred
schemes for showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) how disinterested was his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) love. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) would
write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) and beseech her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) not to allow the performance of a public
duty to injure him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) estimation; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) would write to Mr Harding,
explain all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) views, and boldly claim the warden's daughter, urging
that the untoward circumstances between them need be no bar to their
ancient friendship, or to a closer tie; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) would throw himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
knees before his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) mistress; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) would wait and marry the daughter when
the father has lost his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) home and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) income; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would give up the
lawsuit and go to Australia, with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) of course, leaving _The Jupiter_
and Mr Finney to complete the case between them. Sometimes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Finney</b></font>) woke
in the morning fevered and impatient, he (<font color='blue'><b>Finney</b></font>) would blow out his (<font color='blue'><b>Finney</b></font>) brains and
have done with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Finney</b></font>) cares;--but this idea was generally consequent
on an imprudent supper enjoyed in company with Tom Towers.

<p/>How beautiful Eleanor appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) slowly walked into the
room! Not for nothing had all those little cares been taken. Though
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) sister, the archdeacon's wife, had spoken slightingly of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
charms, Eleanor was very beautiful when seen aright. Hers was not of
those impassive faces, which have the beauty of a marble bust; finely
chiselled features, perfect in every line, true to the rules of
symmetry, as lovely to a stranger as to a friend, unvarying unless in
sickness, or as age affects them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had no startling brilliancy of
beauty, no pearly whiteness, no radiant carnation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had not the
majestic contour that rivets attention, demands instant wonder, and
then disappoints by the coldness of its charms. You might pass
Eleanor Harding in the street without notice, but you could hardly
pass an evening with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) and not lose your heart.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had never appeared more lovely to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) lover than she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) now did. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
face was animated though it was serious, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) full dark lustrous
eyes shone with anxious energy; her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) hand trembled as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) could hardly pronounce his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) name, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). Bold
wished with all his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) heart that the Australian scheme was in the act of
realisation, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) and Eleanor were away together, never to hear
further of the lawsuit.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) began to talk, asked after her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) health,--said something about London
being very stupid, and more about Barchester being very pleasant;
declared the weather to be very hot, and then inquired after Mr
Harding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My father is not very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Harding/ELEANOR</b></font>)</div>said Eleanor.

<p/>John Bold was very sorry,--so sorry: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) hoped it was nothing serious,
and put on the unmeaningly solemn face which people usually use on
such occasions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I especially want to speak to you about my father, Mr Bold; indeed, I
am now here on purpose to do so. Papa is very unhappy, very unhappy
indeed, about this affair of the hospital: you would pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>), Mr
Bold, if you could see how wretched it has made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Miss Harding!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed you would;--anyone would pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>); but a friend, an old friend
as you are,--indeed you would. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is an altered man; his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) cheerfulness
has all gone, and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sweet temper, and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) kind happy tone of voice;
you would hardly know him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) if you saw him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), Mr Bold, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) is so much
altered; and--and--if this goes on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) will die.''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Harding/ELEANOR</b></font>)</div>Here Eleanor had
recourse to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) handkerchief, and so also had her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) auditors; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
plucked up her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) courage, and went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) tale. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) will break his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>)
heart, and die. I am sure, Mr Bold, it was not you who wrote those
cruel things in the newspaper--''

 (<font color='red'><b>John Bold/Bold</b></font>)</div><p/>John Bold eagerly protested that it was not, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) heart smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>)
as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) intimate alliance with Tom Towers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I am sure it was not; and papa has not for a moment thought so;
you would not be so cruel;--but it has nearly killed him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>). Papa cannot
bear to think that people should so speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>), and that everybody
should hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) so spoken of:--they have called him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) avaricious, and
dishonest, and they say he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) is robbing the old men, and taking the
money of the hospital for nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never said so, Miss Harding. I--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Harding/ELEANOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Harding/ELEANOR</b></font>)</div>continued Eleanor, interrupting him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was now in the full
flood-tide of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) eloquence; <div class="bookquote">``no, I am sure you have not; but others
have said so; and if this goes on, if such things are written again,
it will kill papa. Oh! Mr Bold, if you only knew the state he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) is in!
Now papa does not care much about money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Both her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) auditors, brother and sister, assented to this, and declared
on their own knowledge that no man lived less addicted to filthy lucre
than the warden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! it's so kind of you to say so, Mary, and of you too, Mr Bold.
I couldn't bear that people should think unjustly of papa. Do you
know he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) would give up the hospital altogether, only he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) cannot. The
archdeacon says it would be cowardly, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) would be deserting
his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) order, and injuring the church. Whatever may happen, papa will
not do that: he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) would leave the place to-morrow willingly, and give
up his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) house, and the income and all, if the archdeacon--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Harding/ELEANOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Eleanor was going to say <div class="bookquote">``would let him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Harding/ELEANOR</b></font>)</div>but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) stopped herself
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had compromised her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father's dignity; and giving a long
sigh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) added--<div class="bookquote">``Oh, I do so wish he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one who knows Mr Harding personally accuses him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) for a moment,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) that has to bear the punishment; it is he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) that suffers,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Harding/ELEANOR</b></font>)</div>said Eleanor; <div class="bookquote">``and what for? what has he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) done wrong? how has he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
deserved this persecution? he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) that never had an unkind thought in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) that never said an unkind word!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Harding/ELEANOR</b></font>)</div>and here she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) broke down, and
the violence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) sobs stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) utterance.

<p/>Bold, for the fifth or sixth time, declared that neither he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) nor any of
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) friends imputed any blame personally to Mr Harding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) be persecuted?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Harding/ELEANOR</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Eleanor through her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
tears, forgetting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) eagerness that her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) intention had been to
humble herself as a suppliant before John Bold;--<div class="bookquote">``why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) be
singled out for scorn and disgrace? why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) be made so wretched?
Oh! Mr Bold,'' (<font color='red'><b>John Bold/Bold</b></font>)</div>--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) as though the kneeling scene
were about to be commenced,--<div class="bookquote">``oh! Mr Bold, why did you begin all this?
You, whom we all so--so--valued!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>To speak the truth, the reformer's punishment was certainly come upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>reformer</b></font>), for his (<font color='blue'><b>reformer</b></font>) present plight was not enviable; he (<font color='blue'><b>reformer</b></font>) had nothing for it
but to excuse himself by platitudes about public duty, which it is
by no means worth while to repeat, and to reiterate his (<font color='blue'><b>reformer</b></font>) eulogy on Mr
Harding's character. His (<font color='blue'><b>reformer</b></font>) position was certainly a cruel one: had any
gentleman called upon him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) on behalf of Mr Harding he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) could of course
have declined to enter upon the subject; but how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) do so with a
beautiful girl, with the daughter of the man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had injured, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own love?

<p/>In the meantime Eleanor recollected herself, and again summoned up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) energies. <div class="bookquote">``Mr Bold,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I have come here to implore you
to abandon this proceeding.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood up from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seat, and looked
beyond measure distressed. <div class="bookquote">``To implore you to abandon it, to implore
you to spare my father, to spare either his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life or his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) reason, for
one or the other will pay the forfeit if this goes on. I know how
much I am asking, and how little right I have to ask anything; but
I think you will listen to me as it is for my father. Oh, Mr Bold,
pray, pray do this for us;--pray do not drive to distraction a man who
has loved you so well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) did not absolutely kneel to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moved
from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair, and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) soft hands imploringly upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm. Ah!
at any other time how exquisitely valuable would have been that touch!
but now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was distraught, dumbfounded, and unmanned. What could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
say to that sweet suppliant; how explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) that the matter now
was probably beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) control; how tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not quell
the storm which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had raised?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely, surely, John, you cannot refuse her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister.

dishevelled and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) eyes all bloodshot. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had no thought now of
herself, no care now for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) appearance; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) had
never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) half so lovely; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) was amazed at the intensity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
beauty, and could hardly believe that it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) had dared to
love. <div class="bookquote">``Promise me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I will not leave you till you have
promised me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) at length; <div class="bookquote">``I do--all I can do, I will do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then may God Almighty bless you for ever and ever!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Harding/ELEANOR</b></font>)</div>said Eleanor; and
falling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) knees with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) face in Mary's lap, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) wept and sobbed
like a child: her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) strength had carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) through her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) allotted task,
but now it was well nigh exhausted.

<p/>In a while she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was partly recovered, and got up to go, and would have
gone, had not Bold made her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) understand that it was necessary for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>)
to explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) how far it was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) power to put an end to the
proceedings which had been taken against Mr Harding. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) spoken on
any other subject, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) would have vanished, but on that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was bound
to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>); and now the danger of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) position commenced. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
had an active part to play, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) as a suppliant, it
was easy enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) to reject his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) proffered love, and cast from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) caressing words; but now--now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had yielded, and was
talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) calmly and kindly as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father's welfare, it was
hard enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) to do so. Then Mary Bold assisted her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>); but now
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was quite on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) brother's side. Mary said but little, but every
word she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did say gave some direct and deadly blow. The first thing
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did was to make room for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) brother between herself and Eleanor
on the sofa: as the sofa was full large for three, Eleanor could not
resent this, nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) show suspicion by taking another seat; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) felt it to be a most unkind proceeding. And then Mary would talk
as though they three were joined in some close peculiar bond together;
as though they were in future always to wish together, contrive
together, and act together; and Eleanor could not gainsay this; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
could not make another speech, and say, <div class="bookquote">``Mr Bold and I are strangers,
Mary, and are always to remain so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) that, though undoubtedly the proceeding against
the hospital had commenced solely with himself, many others were now
interested in the matter, some of whom were much more influential than
himself; that it was to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) alone, however, that the lawyers looked
for instruction as to their doings, and, more important still, for
the payment of their bills; and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) promised that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would at once
give them notice that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) intention to abandon the cause. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said, that it was not probable that any active steps would
be taken after he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had seceded from the matter, though it was possible
that some passing allusion might still be made to the hospital in the
daily _Jupiter_. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) promised, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would use his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) best
influence to prevent any further personal allusion being made to Mr
Harding. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) then suggested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) would on that afternoon ride over
himself to Dr Grantly, and inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) altered intentions on the
subject, and with this view, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) postponed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) immediate return to
London.

<p/>This was all very pleasant, and Eleanor did enjoy a sort of triumph in
the feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had attained the object for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had sought
this interview; but still the part of Iphigenia was to be played out.
The gods had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) prayer, granted her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) request, and were they not
to have their promised sacrifice? Eleanor was not a girl to defraud
them wilfully; so, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) decently could, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) got up for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
bonnet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going so soon?''  (<font color='red'><b>John Bold/Bold</b></font>)</div>said Bold, who half an hour since would
have given a hundred pounds that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) was in London, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) still at
Barchester.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am so much obliged to you; papa will feel
this to be so kind.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) did not quite appreciate all her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father's
feelings. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I must tell him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), and I will say that you will
see the archdeacon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But may I not say one word for myself?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll fetch you your bonnet, Eleanor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Bold</b></font>)</div>said Mary, in the act of
leaving the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), getting up and catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dress;
<div class="bookquote">``don't go, I'll get my bonnet myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But Mary, the traitress, stood
fast by the door, and permitted no such retreat. Poor Iphigenia!

<p/>And with a volley of impassioned love, John Bold poured forth the
feelings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) heart, swearing, as men do, some truths and many
falsehoods; and Eleanor repeated with every shade of vehemence the
<div class="bookquote">``No, no, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Harding/ELEANOR</b></font>)</div>which had had a short time since so much effect; but
now, alas! its strength was gone. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) be never so vehement, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
vehemence was not respected; all her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``No, no, no's''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>were met with
counter-asseverations, and at last were overpowered. The ground was
cut from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) on every side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was pressed to say whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
father would object; whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) herself had any aversion -LRB-aversion!
God help her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), poor girl! the word nearly made her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) jump into his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) arms-RRB-;
any other preference -LRB-this she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) loudly disclaimed-RRB-; whether it was
impossible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) should love him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) -LRB-Eleanor could not say that it
was impossible-RRB-: and so at last all her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) defences demolished, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
maiden barriers swept away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) capitulated, or rather marched out
with the honours of war, vanquished evidently, palpably vanquished,
but still not reduced to the necessity of confessing it.

<p/>And so the altar on the shore of the modern Aulis reeked with no
sacrifice.




<p/>Chapter XII

<p/>MR BOLD``S VISIT TO PLUMSTEAD


<p/>Whether or no the ill-natured prediction made by certain ladies in
the beginning of the last chapter was or was not carried out to the
letter, I am not in a position to state. Eleanor, however, certainly
did feel herself to have been baffled as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) returned home with all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) news to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father. Certainly she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had been victorious, certainly
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had achieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) object, certainly she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was not unhappy, and yet
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) did not feel herself triumphant. Everything would run smooth now.
Eleanor was not at all addicted to the Lydian school of romance; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
by no means objected to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) lover because he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) came in at the door under
the name of Absolute, instead of pulling her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) out of a window under the
name of Beverley; and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Beverley</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Beverley</b></font>) had been imposed upon, and
could hardly think of Mary Bold with sisterly charity. <div class="bookquote">``I did think
I could have trusted Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) said to herself over and over again.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should have dared to keep me in the room when I tried to
get out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Harding/ELEANOR</b></font>)</div>Eleanor, however, felt that the game was up, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
had now nothing further to do but to add to the budget of news which
was prepared for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father, that John Bold was her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) accepted lover.

<p/>We will, however, now leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) way, and go with John Bold to
Plumstead Episcopi, merely premising that Eleanor on reaching home
will not find things so smooth as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) fondly expected; two messengers
had come, one to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father and the other to the archdeacon, and
each of them much opposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) quiet mode of solving all their
difficulties; the one in the shape of a number of _The Jupiter_, and
the other in that of a further opinion from Sir Abraham Haphazard.

<p/>John Bold got on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) horse and rode off to Plumstead Episcopi; not
briskly and with eager spur, as men do ride when self-satisfied with
their own intentions; but slowly, modestly, thoughtfully, and somewhat
in dread of the coming interview. Now and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) would recur to the
scene which was just over, support himself by the remembrance of the
silence that gives consent, and exult as a happy lover. But even this
feeling was not without a shade of remorse. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) not shown himself
childishly weak thus to yield up the resolve of many hours of thought
to the tears of a pretty girl? How was he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) lawyer?
How was he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) to back out of a matter in which his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) name was already so
publicly concerned? What, oh what! was he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) to say to Tom Towers?
While meditating these painful things he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) reached the lodge leading up
to the archdeacon's glebe, and for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) life found
himself within the sacred precincts.

<p/>All the doctor's children were together on the slope of the lawn,
close to the road, as Bold rode up to the hall door. They were there
holding high debate on matters evidently of deep interest at Plumstead
Episcopi, and the voices of the boys had been heard before the lodge
gate was closed.

<p/>Florinda and Grizzel, frightened at the sight of so well-known an
enemy to the family, fled on the first appearance of the horseman,
and ran in terror to their mother's arms; not for them was it, tender
branches, to resent injuries, or as members of a church militant to
put on armour against its enemies. But the boys stood their ground
like heroes, and boldly demanded the business of the intruder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want to see anybody here, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>said Henry, with a defiant eye
and a hostile tone, which plainly said that at any rate no one there
wanted to see the person so addressed; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) spoke he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) brandished
aloft his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) garden water-pot, holding it by the spout, ready for the
braining of anyone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Henry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles James</b></font>)</div>said Charles James slowly, and with a certain dignity of
diction, <div class="bookquote">``Mr Bold of course would not have come without wanting to see
someone; if Mr Bold has a proper ground for wanting to see some person
here, of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) has a right to come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles James</b></font>)</div><p/>But Samuel stepped lightly up to the horse's head, and offered his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
services. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr Bold,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``papa, I'm sure, will be glad to
see you; I suppose you want to see papa. Shall I hold your horse for
you? Oh what a very pretty horse!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) head and winked
funnily at his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) brothers. <div class="bookquote">``Papa has heard such good news about the old
hospital to-day. We know you'll be glad to hear it, because you're
such a friend of grandpapa Harding, and so much in love with Aunt
Nelly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How d'ye do, lads?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bold, dismounting. <div class="bookquote">``I want to see your
father if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lads!''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>said Henry, turning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) heel and addressing himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
brother, but loud enough to be heard by Bold; <div class="bookquote">``lads, indeed! if we're
lads, what does he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) call himself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles James condescended to say nothing further, but cocked his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) hat
with much precision, and left the visitor to the care of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) youngest
brother.

<p/>Samuel stayed till the servant came, chatting and patting the horse;
but as soon as Bold had disappeared through the front door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) stuck
a switch under the animal's tail to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) kick if possible.

<p/>The church reformer soon found himself _tête-à-tête_ with the
archdeacon in that same room, in that sanctum sanctorum of the
rectory, to which we have already been introduced. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) entered he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
heard the click of a certain patent lock, but it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) with no
surprise; the worthy clergyman was no doubt hiding from eyes profane
his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) last much-studied sermon; for the archdeacon, though he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) preached
but seldom, was famous for his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) sermons. No room, Bold thought, could
have been more becoming for a dignitary of the church; each wall was
loaded with theology; over each separate bookcase was printed in small
gold letters the names of those great divines whose works were ranged
beneath: beginning from the early fathers in due chronological order,
there were to be found the precious labours of the chosen servants
of the church down to the last pamphlet written in opposition to the
consecration of Dr Hampden; and raised above this were to be seen
the busts of the greatest among the great: Chrysostom, St Augustine,
Thomas à Becket, Cardinal Wolsey, Archbishop Laud, and Dr Philpotts.

<p/>Every appliance that could make study pleasant and give ease to the
overtoiled brain was there; chairs made to relieve each limb and
muscle; reading-desks and writing-desks to suit every attitude;
lamps and candles mechanically contrived to throw their light on any
favoured spot, as the student might desire; a shoal of newspapers to
amuse the few leisure moments which might be stolen from the labours
of the day; and then from the window a view right through a bosky
vista along which ran a broad green path from the rectory to the
church,--at the end of which the tawny-tinted fine old tower was seen
with all its variegated pinnacles and parapets. Few parish churches
in England are in better repair, or better worth keeping so, than that
at Plumstead Episcopi; and yet it is built in a faulty style: the body
of the church is low,--so low, that the nearly flat leaden roof would
be visible from the churchyard, were it not for the carved parapet
with which it is surrounded. It is cruciform, though the transepts
are irregular, one being larger than the other; and the tower is much
too high in proportion to the church. But the colour of the building
is perfect; it is that rich yellow gray which one finds nowhere but in
the south and west of England, and which is so strong a characteristic
of most of our old houses of Tudor architecture. The stone work also
is beautiful; the mullions of the windows and the thick tracery of
the Gothic workmanship is as rich as fancy can desire; and though in
gazing on such a structure one knows by rule that the old priests who
built it, built it wrong, one cannot bring oneself to wish that they
should have made it other than it is.

<p/>When Bold was ushered into the book-room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) found its owner standing
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) back to the empty fire-place ready to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>)
could not but perceive that that expansive brow was elated with
triumph, and that those full heavy lips bore more prominently than
usual an appearance of arrogant success.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mr Bold,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>);--<div class="bookquote">``well, what can I do for you?
Very happy, I can assure you, to do anything for such a friend
of my father-in-law.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you'll excuse my calling, Dr Grantly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>said the archdeacon; <div class="bookquote">``I can assure you, no
apology is necessary from Mr Bold;--only let me know what I can do for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr Grantly was standing himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) did not ask Bold to sit, and
therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) had to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) tale standing, leaning on the table, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) did, however, manage to tell it; and as the
archdeacon never once interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>), or even encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) by a
single word, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) was not long in coming to the end of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so, Mr Bold, I'm to understand, I believe, that you are desirous
of abandoning this attack upon Mr Harding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Dr Grantly, there has been no attack, I can assure you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, we won't quarrel about words; I should call it an
attack;--most men would so call an endeavour to take away from a man
every shilling of income that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has to live upon; but it sha'n't be
an attack, if you don't like it; you wish to abandon this--this little
game of backgammon you've begun to play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I intend to put an end to the legal proceedings which I have
commenced.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>said the archdeacon. <div class="bookquote">``You've already had enough
of it; well, I can't say that I am surprised; carrying on a losing
lawsuit where one has nothing to gain, but everything to pay, is not
pleasant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Bold turned very red in the face. <div class="bookquote">``You misinterpret my motives,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but, however, that is of little consequence. I did not come
to trouble you with my motives, but to tell you a matter of fact.
Good-morning, Dr Grantly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One moment,--one moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other. <div class="bookquote">``I don't exactly
appreciate the taste which induced you to make any personal
communication to me on the subject; but I dare say I'm wrong, I dare
say your judgment is the better of the two; but as you have done me
the honour,--as you have, as it were, forced me into a certain amount
of conversation on a subject which had better, perhaps, have been left
to our lawyers, you will excuse me if I ask you to hear my reply to
your communication.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am in no hurry, Dr Grantly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am, Mr Bold; my time is not exactly leisure time, and,
therefore, if you please, we'll go to the point at once:--you're going
to abandon this lawsuit?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) paused for a reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Dr Grantly, I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Having exposed a gentleman who was one of your father's warmest
friends to all the ignominy and insolence which the press could heap
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) name, having somewhat ostentatiously declared that it was
your duty as a man of high public virtue to protect those poor old
fools whom you have humbugged there at the hospital, you now find that
the game costs more than it's worth, and so you make up your mind to
have done with it. A prudent resolution, Mr Bold; but it is a pity
you should have been so long coming to it. Has it struck you that
we may not now choose to give over? that we may find it necessary to
punish the injury you have done to us? Are you aware, sir, that we
have gone to enormous expense to resist this iniquitous attempt of
yours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Bold's face was now furiously red, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) nearly crushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) hat
between his (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) hands; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) said nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have found it necessary to employ the best advice that money
could procure. Are you aware, sir, what may be the probable cost of
securing the services of the attorney-general?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least, Dr Grantly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say not, sir. When you recklessly put this affair into
the hands of your friend Mr Finney, whose six-and-eightpences and
thirteen-and-fourpences may, probably, not amount to a large sum, you
were indifferent as to the cost and suffering which such a proceeding
might entail on others; but are you aware, sir, that these crushing
costs must now come out of your own pocket?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Any demand of such a nature which Mr Harding's lawyer may have to
make will doubtless be made to my lawyer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Mr Harding's lawyer and my lawyer!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Did you come here merely to
refer me to the lawyers? Upon my word I think the honour of your
visit might have been spared! And now, sir, I'll tell you what my
opinion is:--my opinion is, that we shall not allow you to withdraw
this matter from the courts.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can do as you please, Dr Grantly; good-morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hear me out, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>said the archdeacon; <div class="bookquote">``I have here in my hands the
last opinion given in this matter by Sir Abraham Haphazard. I dare
say you have already heard of this;--I dare say it has had something
to do with your visit here to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing whatever of Sir Abraham Haphazard or his (<font color='blue'><b>Haphazard</b></font>) opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be that as it may, here it is; he (<font color='blue'><b>Haphazard</b></font>) declares most explicitly that under
no phasis of the affair whatever have you a leg to stand upon; that Mr
Harding is as safe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) hospital as I am here in my rectory; that a
more futile attempt to destroy a man was never made, than this which
you have made to ruin Mr Harding. Here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) slapped the paper
on the table, <div class="bookquote">``I have this opinion from the very first lawyer in the
land; and under these circumstances you expect me to make you a low
bow for your kind offer to release Mr Harding from the toils of your
net! Sir, your net is not strong enough to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>); sir, your net
has fallen to pieces, and you knew that well enough before I told
you--and now, sir, I'll wish you good-morning, for I'm busy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Bold was now choking with passion. He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had let the archdeacon run on
because he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) knew not with what words to interrupt him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>); but now that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>)
had been so defied and insulted, he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) could not leave the room without
some reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dr Grantly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) commenced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have nothing further to say or to hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>said the archdeacon.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll do myself the honour to order your horse.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) rang the
bell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I came here, Dr Grantly, with the warmest, kindest feelings--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, of course you did; nobody doubts it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With the kindest feelings;--and they have been most grossly outraged
by your treatment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course they have;--I have not chosen to see my father-in-law
ruined; what an outrage that has been to your feelings!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The time will come, Dr Grantly, when you will understand why I called
upon you to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt, no doubt. Is Mr Bold's horse there? That's right; open
the front door. Good-morning, Mr Bold;''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>and the doctor stalked into
his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) own drawing-room, closing the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), and making it quite
impossible that John Bold should speak another word.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) got on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) horse, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) was fain to do feeling like a dog
turned out of a kitchen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) was again greeted by little Sammy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Mr Bold; I hope we may have the pleasure of seeing you
again before long; I am sure papa will always be glad to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John Bold/Bold</b></font>)</div><p/>That was certainly the bitterest moment in John Bold's life. Not even
the remembrance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) successful love could comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>); nay, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) thought of Eleanor he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) felt that it was that very love which had
brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) to such a pass. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) should have been so insulted,
and be unable to reply! That he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) should have given up so much to the
request of a girl, and then have had his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) motives so misunderstood!
That he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) should have made so gross a mistake as this visit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) to
the archdeacon's! He (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) bit the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) whip, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) penetrated the
horn of which it was made: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) struck the poor animal in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) anger, and
then was doubly angry with himself at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) futile passion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) had been
so completely checkmated, so palpably overcome! and what was he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) to do?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) could not continue his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) action after pledging himself to abandon it;
nor was there any revenge in that;--it was the very step to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>)
enemy had endeavoured to goad him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>)!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) threw the reins to the servant who came to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) horse, and
rushed upstairs into his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) drawing-room, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) sister Mary was
sitting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If there be a devil,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``a real devil here on earth, it is
Dr Grantly.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) vouchsafed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) no further intelligence, but again
seizing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) hat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) rushed out, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) departure for London
without another word to anyone.




<p/>Chapter XIII

<p/>THE WARDEN``S DECISION


<p/>The meeting between Eleanor and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father was not so stormy as that
described in the last chapter, but it was hardly more successful. On
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) return from Bold's house she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father in a strange state.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) was not sorrowful and silent as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) had been on that memorable
day when his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) son-in-law lectured him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) as to all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) owed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>)
order; nor was he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) usual quiet mood. When Eleanor reached the
hospital, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) was walking to and fro upon the lawn, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) soon saw
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) was much excited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to London, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) said as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``London, papa!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear, to London; I will have this matter settled some way;
there are some things, Eleanor, which I cannot bear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa, what is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), leading him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) by the arm into the
house. <div class="bookquote">``I had such good news for you, and now you make me fear I am
too late.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) could let her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) know what had caused
this sudden resolve, or could point to the fatal paper which lay on
the table, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) that the lawsuit was over, that Bold had
commissioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) name that it would be
abandoned,--that there was no further cause for misery, that the whole
matter might be looked on as though it had never been discussed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
did not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with what determined vehemence she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had obtained this
concession in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) favour, nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mention the price she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was to pay
for it.

<p/>The warden did not express himself peculiarly gratified at this
intelligence, and Eleanor, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had not worked for thanks, and
was by no means disposed to magnify her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) own good offices, felt hurt
at the manner in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) news was received. <div class="bookquote">``Mr Bold can act as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) thinks proper, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``if Mr Bold thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) has been
wrong, of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) will discontinue what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) is doing; but that cannot
change my purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) exclaimed, all but crying with vexation; <div class="bookquote">``I thought
you would have been so happy;--I thought all would have been right
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Bold,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>continued he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``has set great people to work,--so great that
I doubt they are now beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) control. Read that, my dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The
warden, doubling up a number of _The Jupiter_, pointed to the peculiar
article which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was to read. It was to the last of the three
leaders, which are generally furnished daily for the support of the
nation, that Mr Harding directed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) attention. It dealt some heavy
blows on various clerical delinquents; on families who received their
tens of thousands yearly for doing nothing; on men who, as the article
stated, rolled in wealth which they had neither earned nor inherited,
and which was in fact stolen from the poorer clergy. It named some
sons of bishops, and grandsons of archbishops; men great in their way,
who had redeemed their disgrace in the eyes of many by the enormity of
their plunder; and then, having disposed of these leviathans, it
descended to Mr Harding.


<p/>We alluded some weeks since to an instance of similar
injustice, though in a more humble scale, in which the warden
of an almshouse at Barchester has become possessed of the
income of the greater part of the whole institution. Why an
almshouse should have a warden we cannot pretend to explain,
nor can we say what special need twelve old men can have for
the services of a separate clergyman, seeing that they have
twelve reserved seats for themselves in Barchester Cathedral.
But be this as it may, let the gentleman call himself warden
or precentor, or what he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) will, let him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) be never so scrupulous
in exacting religious duties from his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) twelve dependents, or
never so negligent as regards the services of the cathedral,
it appears palpably clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) can be entitled to no
portion of the revenue of the hospital, excepting that which
the founder set apart for him (<font color='blue'><b>founder</b></font>); and it is equally clear that
the founder did not intend that three-fifths of his (<font color='blue'><b>founder</b></font>) charity
should be so consumed.

<p/>The case is certainly a paltry one after the tens of
thousands with which we have been dealing, for the warden's
income is after all but a poor eight hundred a year: eight
hundred a year is not magnificent preferment of itself, and
the warden may, for anything we know, be worth much more to
the church; but if so, let the church pay him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) out of funds
justly at its own disposal.

<p/>We allude to the question of the Barchester almshouse at the
present moment, because we understand that a plea has been
set up which will be peculiarly revolting to the minds of
English churchmen. An action has been taken against Mr
Warden Harding, on behalf of the almsmen, by a gentleman
acting solely on public grounds, and it is to be argued that
Mr Harding takes nothing but what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) received as a servant of
the hospital, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) is not himself responsible for the
amount of stipend given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) work. Such a plea
would doubtless be fair, if anyone questioned the daily wages
of a bricklayer employed on the building, or the fee of the
charwoman who cleans it; but we cannot envy the feeling of a
clergyman of the Church of England who could allow such an
argument to be put in his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) mouth.

<p/>If this plea be put forward we trust Mr Harding will be
forced as a witness to state the nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) employment;
the amount of work that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) does; the income which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
receives; and the source from whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) obtained his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
appointment. We do not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) will receive much public
sympathy to atone for the annoyance of such an examination.


<p/>As Eleanor read the article her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) face flushed with indignation, and
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had finished it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) almost feared to look up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``what do you think of that;--is it worth
while to be a warden at that price?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa;--dear papa!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Bold can't un-write that, my dear;--Mr Bold can't say that that
sha'n't be read by every clergyman at Oxford; nay, by every gentleman
in the land;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) walked up and down the room, while Eleanor
in mute despair followed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``And I'll tell you what,
my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) continued, speaking now very calmly, and in a forced
manner very unlike himself; <div class="bookquote">``Mr Bold can't dispute the truth of every
word in that article you have just read--nor can I.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Eleanor stared
at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) scarcely understood the words he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was speaking.
<div class="bookquote">``Nor can I, Eleanor: that's the worst of all, or would be so if
there were no remedy. I have thought much of all this since we were
together last night;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came and sat beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), and put his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arm
round her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) waist as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had done then. <div class="bookquote">``I have thought much of what the
archdeacon has said, and of what this paper says; and I do believe I
have no right to be here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No right to be warden of the hospital, papa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No right to be warden with eight hundred a year; no right to be
warden with such a house as this; no right to spend in luxury money
that was intended for charity. Mr Bold may do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) pleases about his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>)
suit, but I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) will not abandon it for my sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Harding/ELEANOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Eleanor! this was hard upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>). Was it for this she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) great resolve! For this that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had laid aside her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) quiet
demeanour, and taken upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) the rants of a tragedy heroine! One
may work and not for thanks, but yet feel hurt at not receiving them;
and so it was with Eleanor: one may be disinterested in one's good
actions, and yet feel discontented that they are not recognised.
Charity may be given with the left hand so privily that the right hand
does not know it, and yet the left hand may regret to feel that it has
no immediate reward. Eleanor had had no wish to burden her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father
with a weight of obligation, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had looked forward to much
delight from the knowledge that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had freed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sorrows:
now such hopes were entirely over: all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had done was of no
avail; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had humbled herself to Bold in vain; the evil was utterly
beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) power to cure!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had thought also how gently she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) would whisper to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father all
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) lover had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) about herself, and how impossible she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
had found it to reject him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>): and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had anticipated her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father's
kindly kiss and close embrace as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sanction to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) love.
Alas! she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) could say nothing of this now. In speaking of Mr Bold, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
father put him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) aside as one whose thoughts and sayings and acts could
be of no moment. Gentle reader, did you ever feel yourself snubbed?
Did you ever, when thinking much of your own importance, find yourself
suddenly reduced to a nonentity? Such was Eleanor's feeling now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They shall not put forward this plea on my behalf,''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>continued the
warden. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever may be the truth of the matter, that at any rate is
not true; and the man who wrote that article is right in saying that
such a plea is revolting to an honest mind. I will go up to London,
my dear, and see these lawyers myself, and if no better excuse can be
made for me than that, I and the hospital will part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the archdeacon, papa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help it, my dear; there are some things which a man cannot
bear:--I cannot bear that;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) hand upon the newspaper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But will the archdeacon go with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div><p/>To tell the truth, Mr Harding had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) mind to steal a march
upon the archdeacon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) could take no steps without
informing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) dread son-in-law, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) would send
out a note to Plumstead Episcopi detailing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) plans, but that the
messenger should not leave Barchester till he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) himself had started
for London; so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) might be a day before the doctor, who, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had
no doubt, would follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>). In that day, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had luck, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) might
arrange it all; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) might explain to Sir Abraham that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), as warden,
would have nothing further to do with the defence about to be set up;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) might send in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) official resignation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) friend the bishop,
and so make public the whole transaction, that even the doctor would
not be able to undo what he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had done. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) knew too well the doctor's
strength and his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) own weakness to suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) could do this, if they
both reached London together; indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would never be able to get to
London, if the doctor knew of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) intended journey in time to prevent
it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I think not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I think I shall start before the
archdeacon could be ready;--I shall go early to-morrow morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will be best, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Harding/ELEANOR</b></font>)</div>said Eleanor, showing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father's
ruse was appreciated.

<p/>``Why yes, my love. The fact is, I wish to do all this before the
archdeacon can--can interfere. There is a great deal of truth in
all he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) says;--he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) argues very well, and I can't always answer him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>);
but there is an old saying, Nelly: ``Everyone knows where his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) own
shoe pinches!<div class="bookquote">'' He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'ll say that I want moral courage, and strength of
character, and power of endurance, and it's all true; but I'm sure I
ought not to remain here, if I have nothing better to put forward than
a quibble: so, Nelly, we shall have to leave this pretty place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Everyone</b></font>)</div><p/>Eleanor's face brightened up, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father how cordially
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) agreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``True, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), now again quite happy and at ease in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
manner. <div class="bookquote">``What good to us is this place or all the money, if we are to
be ill-spoken of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa, I am so glad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My darling child! It did cost me a pang at first, Nelly, to think
that you should lose your pretty drawing-room, and your ponies, and
your garden: the garden will be the worst of all;--but there is a
garden at Crabtree, a very pretty garden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Crabtree Parva/Crabtree</b></font>)</div><p/>Crabtree Parva was the name of the small living which Mr Harding had
held as a minor canon, and which still belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>). It was only
worth some eighty pounds a year, and a small house and glebe, all
of which were now handed over to Mr Harding's curate; but it was to
Crabtree glebe that Mr Harding thought of retiring. This parish must
not be mistaken for that other living, Crabtree Canonicorum, as it is
called. Crabtree Canonicorum is a very nice thing; there are only two
hundred parishioners; there are four hundred acres of glebe; and the
great and small tithes, which both go to the rector, are worth four
hundred pounds a year more. Crabtree Canonicorum is in the gift of
the dean and chapter, and is at this time possessed by the Honourable
and Reverend Dr Vesey Stanhope, who also fills the prebendal stall
of Goosegorge in Barchester Chapter, and holds the united rectory of
Eiderdown and Stogpingum, or Stoke Pinquium, as it should be written.
This is the same Dr Vesey Stanhope whose hospitable villa on the Lake
of Como is so well known to the _élite_ of English travellers, and
whose collection of Lombard butterflies is supposed to be unique.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>said the warden, musing, <div class="bookquote">``there is a very pretty garden at
Crabtree;--but I shall be sorry to disturb poor Smith.''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>Smith was the
curate of Crabtree, a gentleman who was maintaining a wife and half a
dozen children on the income arising from his (<font color='blue'><b>Crabtree</b></font>) profession.

<p/>Eleanor assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father that, as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was concerned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
could leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) house and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) ponies without a single regret. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was
only so happy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crabtree</b></font>) was going--going where he (<font color='blue'><b>Crabtree</b></font>) would escape all this
dreadful turmoil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But we will take the music, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div><p/>And so they went on planning their future happiness, and plotting how
they would arrange it all without the interposition of the archdeacon,
and at last they again became confidential, and then the warden did
thank her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had done, and Eleanor, lying on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father's
shoulder, did find an opportunity to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) secret: and the father
gave his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) blessing to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) child, and said that the man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
loved was honest, good, and kind-hearted, and right-thinking in the
main,--one who wanted only a good wife to put him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) quite upright,--<div class="bookquote">``a
man, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ended by saying, <div class="bookquote">``to whom I firmly believe that I
can trust my treasure with safety.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what will Dr Grantly say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, it can't be helped;--we shall be out at Crabtree
then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Harding/ELEANOR</b></font>)</div><p/>And Eleanor ran upstairs to prepare her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father's clothes for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
journey; and the warden returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) garden to make his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) last adieux
to every tree, and shrub, and shady nook that he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) knew so well.




<p/>Chapter XIV

<p/>MOUNT OLYMPUS


<p/>Wretched in spirit, groaning under the feeling of insult,
self-condemning, and ill-satisfied in every way, Bold returned to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) London lodgings. Ill as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) had fared in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) interview with the
archdeacon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) was not the less under the necessity of carrying out
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) pledge to Eleanor; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) went about his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) ungracious task with a
heavy heart.

<p/>The attorneys whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) had employed in London received his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) instructions
with surprise and evident misgiving; however, they could only obey,
and mutter something of their sorrow that such heavy costs should
only fall upon their own employer,--especially as nothing was wanting
but perseverance to throw them on the opposite party. Bold left the
office which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) had latterly so much frequented, shaking the dust from
off his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) feet; and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) was down the stairs, an edict had already
gone forth for the preparation of the bill.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) next thought of the newspapers. The case had been taken up by more
than one; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) was well aware that the keynote had been sounded by
_The Jupiter_. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) had been very intimate with Tom Towers, and had
often discussed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) the affairs of the hospital. Bold could
not say that the articles in that paper had been written at his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) own
instigation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) did not even know, as a fact, that they had been
written by his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) friend. Tom Towers had never said that such a view of
the case, or such a side in the dispute, would be taken by the paper
with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) was connected. Very discreet in such matters was Tom
Towers, and altogether indisposed to talk loosely of the concerns
of that mighty engine of which it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) high privilege to move
in secret some portion. Nevertheless Bold believed that to him (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>)
were owing those dreadful words which had caused such panic at
Barchester,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) conceived himself bound to prevent their
repetition. With this view he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) betook himself from the attorneys'
office to that laboratory where, with amazing chemistry, Tom Towers
compounded thunderbolts for the destruction of all that is evil, and
for the furtherance of all that is good, in this and other
hemispheres.

<p/>Who has not heard of Mount Olympus,--that high abode of all the powers
of type, that favoured seat of the great goddess Pica, that wondrous
habitation of gods and devils, from whence, with ceaseless hum of
steam and never-ending flow of Castalian ink, issue forth fifty
thousand nightly edicts for the governance of a subject nation?

<p/>Velvet and gilding do not make a throne, nor gold and jewels a
sceptre. It is a throne because the most exalted one sits there,--and
a sceptre because the most mighty one wields it. So it is with Mount
Olympus. Should a stranger make his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) way thither at dull noonday, or
during the sleepy hours of the silent afternoon, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) would find no
acknowledged temple of power and beauty, no fitting fane for the
great Thunderer, no proud façades and pillared roofs to support
the dignity of this greatest of earthly potentates. To the
outward and uninitiated eye, Mount Olympus is a somewhat humble
spot,--undistinguished, unadorned,--nay, almost mean. It stands
alone, as it were, in a mighty city, close to the densest throng
of men, but partaking neither of the noise nor the crowd; a small
secluded, dreary spot, tenanted, one would say, by quite unambitious
people at the easiest rents. <div class="bookquote">``Is this Mount Olympus?''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>asks the
unbelieving stranger. <div class="bookquote">``Is it from these small, dark, dingy buildings
that those infallible laws proceed which cabinets are called upon to
obey; by which bishops are to be guided, lords and commons controlled,
judges instructed in law, generals in strategy, admirals in naval
tactics, and orange-women in the management of their barrows?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my friend--from these walls. From here issue the only known
infallible bulls for the guidance of British souls and bodies.
This little court is the Vatican of England. Here reigns a
pope, self-nominated, self-consecrated,--ay, and much stranger
too,--self-believing!--a pope whom, if you cannot obey him (<font color='blue'><b>pope</b></font>), I would
advise you to disobey as silently as possible; a pope hitherto afraid
of no Luther; a pope who manages his (<font color='blue'><b>pope</b></font>) own inquisition, who punishes
unbelievers as no most skilful inquisitor of Spain ever dreamt of
doing;--one who can excommunicate thoroughly, fearfully, radically;
put you beyond the pale of men's charity; make you odious to your
dearest friends, and turn you into a monster to be pointed at by the
finger!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh heavens! and this is Mount Olympus!

<p/>It is a fact amazing to ordinary mortals that _The Jupiter_ is never
wrong. With what endless care, with what unsparing labour, do we not
strive to get together for our great national council the men most
fitting to compose it. And how we fail! Parliament is always wrong:
look at _The Jupiter_, and see how futile are their meetings, how vain
their council, how needless all their trouble! With what pride do we
regard our chief ministers, the great servants of state, the oligarchs
of the nation on whose wisdom we lean, to whom we look for guidance in
our difficulties! But what are they to the writers of _The Jupiter_?
They hold council together and with anxious thought painfully
elaborate their country's good; but when all is done, _The Jupiter_
declares that all is naught. Why should we look to Lord John
Russell;--why should we regard Palmerston and Gladstone, when Tom
Towers without a struggle can put us right? Look at our generals,
what faults they make; at our admirals, how inactive they are. What
money, honesty, and science can do, is done; and yet how badly are our
troops brought together, fed, conveyed, clothed, armed, and managed.
The most excellent of our good men do their best to man our ships,
with the assistance of all possible external appliances; but in vain.
All, all is wrong--alas! alas! Tom Towers, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) alone, knows all
about it. Why, oh why, ye earthly ministers, why have ye not followed
more closely this heaven-sent messenger that is among us?

<p/>Were it not well for us in our ignorance that we confided all things
to _The Jupiter_? Would it not be wise in us to abandon useless
talking, idle thinking, and profitless labour? Away with majorities
in the House of Commons, with verdicts from judicial bench given after
much delay, with doubtful laws, and the fallible attempts of humanity!
Does not _The Jupiter_, coming forth daily with fifty thousand
impressions full of unerring decision on every mortal subject, set all
matters sufficiently at rest? Is not Tom Towers here, able to guide
us and willing?

<p/>Yes indeed, able and willing to guide all men in all things, so
long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) is obeyed as autocrat should be obeyed,--with undoubting
submission: only let not ungrateful ministers seek other colleagues
than those whom Tom Towers may approve; let church and state, law and
physic, commerce and agriculture, the arts of war, and the arts of
peace, all listen and obey, and all will be made perfect. Has not Tom
Towers an all-seeing eye? From the diggings of Australia to those of
California, right round the habitable globe, does he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) not know, watch,
and chronicle the doings of everyone? From a bishopric in New Zealand
to an unfortunate director of a North-west passage, is he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) not the only
fit judge of capability? From the sewers of London to the Central
Railway of India,--from the palaces of St Petersburg to the cabins of
Connaught, nothing can escape him (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>). Britons have but to read, to obey,
and be blessed. None but the fools doubt the wisdom of _The Jupiter_;
none but the mad dispute its facts.

<p/>No established religion has ever been without its unbelievers, even
in the country where it is the most firmly fixed; no creed has been
without scoffers; no church has so prospered as to free itself
entirely from dissent. There are those who doubt _The Jupiter_!
They live and breathe the upper air, walking here unscathed, though
scorned,--men, born of British mothers and nursed on English milk, who
scruple not to say that Mount Olympus has its price, that Tom Towers
can be bought for gold!

<p/>Such is Mount Olympus, the mouthpiece of all the wisdom of this great
country. It may probably be said that no place in this 19th century
is more worthy of notice. No treasury mandate armed with the
signatures of all the government has half the power of one of those
broad sheets, which fly forth from hence so abundantly, armed with no
signature at all.

<p/>Some great man, some mighty peer,--we'll say a noble duke,--retires to
rest feared and honoured by all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) countrymen,--fearless himself; if
not a good man, at any rate a mighty man,--too mighty to care much
what men may say about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) want of virtue. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rises in the morning
degraded, mean, and miserable; an object of men's scorn, anxious only
to retire as quickly as may be to some German obscurity, some unseen
Italian privacy, or indeed, anywhere out of sight. What has made this
awful change? what has so afflicted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? An article has appeared in
_The Jupiter_; some fifty lines of a narrow column have destroyed all
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grace's equanimity, and banished him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for ever from the world.
No man knows who wrote the bitter words; the clubs talk confusedly of
the matter, whispering to each other this and that name; while Tom
Towers walks quietly along Pall Mall, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) coat buttoned close
against the east wind, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) were a mortal man, and not a god
dispensing thunderbolts from Mount Olympus.

<p/>It was not to Mount Olympus that our friend Bold betook himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
had before now wandered round that lonely spot, thinking how grand a
thing it was to write articles for _The Jupiter_; considering within
himself whether by any stretch of the powers within him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could ever
come to such distinction; wondering how Tom Towers would take any
little humble offering of his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) talents; calculating that Tom Towers
himself must have once had a beginning, have once doubted as to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) own success. Towers could not have been born a writer in _The
Jupiter_. With such ideas, half ambitious and half awe-struck, had
Bold regarded the silent-looking workshop of the gods; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) had
never yet by word or sign attempted to influence the slightest word
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) unerring friend. On such a course was he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) now intent; and not
without much inward palpitation did he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) betake himself to the quiet
abode of wisdom, where Tom Towers was to be found o' mornings inhaling
ambrosia and sipping nectar in the shape of toast and tea.

<p/>Not far removed from Mount Olympus, but somewhat nearer to the blessed
regions of the West, is the most favoured abode of Themis. Washed by
the rich tide which now passes from the towers of Cæsar to Barry's
halls of eloquence; and again back, with new offerings of a city's
tribute, from the palaces of peers to the mart of merchants, stand
those quiet walls which Law has delighted to honour by its presence.
What a world within a world is the Temple! how quiet are its
<div class="bookquote">``entangled walks,''  (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>as someone lately has called them, and yet how
close to the densest concourse of humanity! how gravely respectable
its sober alleys, though removed but by a single step from the
profanity of the Strand and the low iniquity of Fleet Street! Old
St Dunstan, with its bell-smiting bludgeoners, has been removed; the
ancient shops with their faces full of pleasant history are passing
away one by one; the bar itself is to go--its doom has been pronounced
by _The Jupiter_; rumour tells us of some huge building that is to
appear in these latitudes dedicated to law, subversive of the courts
of Westminster, and antagonistic to the Rolls and Lincoln's Inn; but
nothing yet threatens the silent beauty of the Temple: it is the
mediæval court of the metropolis.

<p/>Here, on the choicest spot of this choice ground, stands a lofty row
of chambers, looking obliquely upon the sullied Thames; before the
windows, the lawn of the Temple Gardens stretches with that dim yet
delicious verdure so refreshing to the eyes of Londoners. If doomed
to live within the thickest of London smoke you would surely say that
that would be your chosen spot. Yes, you, you whom I now address, my
dear, middle-aged bachelor friend, can nowhere be so well domiciled
as here. No one here will ask whether you are out or at home; alone
or with friends; here no Sabbatarian will investigate your Sundays,
no censorious landlady will scrutinise your empty bottle, no
valetudinarian neighbour will complain of late hours. If you love
books, to what place are books so suitable? The whole spot is
redolent of typography. Would you worship the Paphian goddess, the
groves of Cyprus are not more taciturn than those of the Temple.
Wit and wine are always here, and always together; the revels of the
Temple are as those of polished Greece, where the wildest worshipper
of Bacchus never forgot the dignity of the god whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bacchus</b></font>) adored. Where
can retirement be so complete as here? where can you be so sure of all
the pleasures of society?

<p/>It was here that Tom Towers lived, and cultivated with eminent success
the tenth Muse who now governs the periodical press. But let it not
be supposed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Muse</b></font>) chambers were such, or so comfortless, as are
frequently the gaunt abodes of legal aspirants. Four chairs, a
half-filled deal book-case with hangings of dingy green baize, an old
office table covered with dusty papers, which are not moved once in
six months, and an older Pembroke brother with rickety legs, for all
daily uses; a despatcher for the preparation of lobsters and coffee,
and an apparatus for the cooking of toast and mutton chops; such
utensils and luxuries as these did not suffice for the well-being of
Tom Towers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) indulged in four rooms on the first floor, each of
which was furnished, if not with the splendour, with probably more
than the comfort of Stafford House. Every addition that science
and art have lately made to the luxuries of modern life was to be
found there. The room in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Stafford</b></font>) usually sat was surrounded by
book-shelves carefully filled; nor was there a volume there which was
not entitled to its place in such a collection, both by its intrinsic
worth and exterior splendour: a pretty portable set of steps in one
corner of the room showed that those even on the higher shelves were
intended for use. The chamber contained but two works of art:--the
one, an admirable bust of Sir Robert Peel, by Power, declared the
individual politics of our friend; and the other, a singularly long
figure of a female devotee, by Millais, told equally plainly the
school of art to which he (<font color='blue'><b>devotee</b></font>) was addicted. This picture was not hung,
as pictures usually are, against the wall; there was no inch of wall
vacant for such a purpose: it had a stand or desk erected for its own
accommodation; and there on her (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) pedestal, framed and glazed, stood
the devotional lady looking intently at a lily as no lady ever looked
before.

<p/>Our modern artists, whom we style Pre-Raphaelites, have delighted
to go back, not only to the finish and peculiar manner, but also to
the subjects of the early painters. It is impossible to give them
too much praise for the elaborate perseverance with which they have
equalled the minute perfections of the masters from whom they take
their inspiration: nothing probably can exceed the painting of some of
these latter-day pictures. It is, however, singular into what faults
they fall as regards their subjects: they are not quite content to
take the old stock groups,--a Sebastian with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sebastian</b></font>) arrows, a Lucia with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucia</b></font>) eyes in a dish, a Lorenzo with a gridiron, or the Virgin with two
children. But they are anything but happy in their change. As a
rule, no figure should be drawn in a position which it is impossible
to suppose any figure should maintain. The patient endurance of St
Sebastian, the wild ecstasy of St John in the Wilderness, the maternal
love of the Virgin, are feelings naturally portrayed by a fixed
posture; but the lady with the stiff back and bent neck, who looks at
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) flower, and is still looking from hour to hour, gives us an idea
of pain without grace, and abstraction without a cause.

<p/>It was easy, from his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) rooms, to see that Tom Towers was a Sybarite,
though by no means an idle one. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was lingering over his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) last cup of
tea, surrounded by an ocean of newspapers, through which he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had been
swimming, when John Bold's card was brought in by his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) tiger. This
tiger never knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) master was at home, though he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) often knew
that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was not, and thus Tom Towers was never invaded but by his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>)
own consent. On this occasion, after twisting the card twice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>)
fingers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) signified to his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) attendant imp that he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) was visible; and
the inner door was unbolted, and our friend announced.

<p/>I have before said that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) of _The Jupiter_ and John Bold were
intimate. There was no very great difference in their ages, for
Towers was still considerably under forty; and when Bold had been
attending the London hospitals, Towers, who was not then the great man
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had since become, had been much with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Then they had often
discussed together the objects of their ambition and future prospects;
then Tom Towers was struggling hard to maintain himself, as a
briefless barrister, by shorthand reporting for any of the papers that
would engage him (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>); then he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) had not dared to dream of writing leaders
for _The Jupiter_, or canvassing the conduct of Cabinet ministers.
Things had altered since that time: the briefless barrister was still
briefless, but he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) now despised briefs: could he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) have been sure of a
judge's seat, he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) would hardly have left his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) present career. It is
true he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) wore no ermine, bore no outward marks of a world's respect;
but with what a load of inward importance was he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) charged! It is true
his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) name appeared in no large capitals; on no wall was chalked up <div class="bookquote">``Tom
Towers for ever;'' (<font color='red'><b>member</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Freedom of the Press and Tom Towers;''  (<font color='red'><b>member</b></font>)</div>but what
member of Parliament had half his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) power? It is true that in far-off
provinces men did not talk daily of Tom Towers but they read _The
Jupiter_, and acknowledged that without _The Jupiter_ life was not
worth having. This kind of hidden but still conscious glory suited
the nature of the man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved to sit silent in a corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) club
and listen to the loud chattering of politicians, and to think how
they all were in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power;--how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could smite the loudest of them,
were it worth his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) while to raise his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pen for such a purpose. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved
to watch the great men of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daily wrote, and flatter himself
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was greater than any of them. Each of them was responsible to
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) country, each of them must answer if inquired into, each of them
must endure abuse with good humour, and insolence without anger. But
to whom was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Tom Towers, responsible? No one could insult him (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>);
no one could inquire into him (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) could speak out withering words,
and no one could answer him (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>): ministers courted him (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>), though perhaps
they knew not his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) name; bishops feared him (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>); judges doubted their own
verdicts unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) confirmed them; and generals, in their councils of
war, did not consider more deeply what the enemy would do, than what
_The Jupiter_ would say. Tom Towers never boasted of _The Jupiter_;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) scarcely ever named the paper even to the most intimate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>)
friends; he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) did not even wish to be spoken of as connected with it;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) did not the less value his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) privileges, or think the less of his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>)
own importance. It is probable that Tom Towers considered himself
the most powerful man in Europe; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) walked on from day to day,
studiously striving to look a man, but knowing within his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breast that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a god.




<p/>Chapter XV

<p/>TOM TOWERS, DR ANTICANT, AND MR SENTIMENT


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Bold! how are you? You haven't breakfasted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>XV</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, hours ago. And how are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>When one Esquimau meets another, do the two, as an invariable rule,
ask after each other's health? is it inherent in all human nature to
make this obliging inquiry? Did any reader of this tale ever meet
any friend or acquaintance without asking some such question, and did
anyone ever listen to the reply? Sometimes a studiously courteous
questioner will show so much thought in the matter as to answer it
himself, by declaring that had he (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) looked at you he (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) needn't have asked;
meaning thereby to signify that you are an absolute personification of
health: but such persons are only those who premeditate small effects.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you're busy?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>inquired Bold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, yes, rather;--or I should say rather not. If I have a leisure
hour in the day, this is it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to ask you if you can oblige me in a certain matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Towers understood in a moment, from the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) friend's voice,
that the certain matter referred to the newspaper. He (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) smiled, and
nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) head, but made no promise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know this lawsuit that I've been engaged in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Towers/Towers</b></font>)</div>said Bold.

<p/>Tom Towers intimated that he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) was aware of the action which was pending
about the hospital.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I've abandoned it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom Towers/Towers</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom Towers merely raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) eyebrows, thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>)
trowsers pockets, and waited for his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) friend to proceed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I've given it up. I needn't trouble you with all the history;
but the fact is that the conduct of Mr Harding--Mr Harding is the--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom Towers/Towers</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, the master of the place; the man who takes all the money and
does nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Towers/Towers</b></font>)</div>said Tom Towers, interrupting him (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't know about that; but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conduct in the matter has been
so excellent, so little selfish, so open, that I cannot proceed in the
matter to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) detriment.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Bold's heart misgave him (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) as to Eleanor as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) said this; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) felt that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) said was not untrue. <div class="bookquote">``I
think nothing should now be done till the wardenship be vacant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And be again filled,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Towers/Towers</b></font>)</div>said Towers, <div class="bookquote">``as it certainly would, before
anyone heard of the vacancy; and the same objection would again exist.
It's an old story, that of the vested rights of the incumbent; but
suppose the incumbent has only a vested wrong, and that the poor of
the town have a vested right, if they only knew how to get at it: is
not that something the case here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom Towers/Towers</b></font>)</div><p/>Bold couldn't deny it, but thought it was one of those cases which
required a good deal of management before any real good could be done.
It was a pity that he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) had not considered this before he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) crept into the
lion's mouth, in the shape of an attorney's office.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will cost you a good deal, I fear,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Towers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A few hundreds,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bold--<div class="bookquote">``perhaps three hundred; I can't help
that, and am prepared for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's philosophical. It's quite refreshing to hear a man talking of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hundreds in so purely indifferent a manner. But I'm sorry you are
giving the matter up. It injures a man to commence a thing of this
kind, and not carry it through. Have you seen that?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) threw
a small pamphlet across the table, which was all but damp from the
press.

<p/>Bold had not seen it nor heard of it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) was well acquainted with
the author of it,--a gentleman whose pamphlets, condemnatory of all
things in these modern days, had been a good deal talked about of
late.

<p/>Dr Pessimist Anticant was a Scotchman, who had passed a great portion
of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) early days in Germany; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had studied there with much effect,
and had learnt to look with German subtilty into the root of things,
and to examine for himself their intrinsic worth and worthlessness.
No man ever resolved more bravely than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to accept as good nothing
that was evil; to banish from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as evil nothing that was good. ``Tis
a pity that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should not have recognised the fact, that in this world
no good is unalloyed, and that there is but little evil that has not
in it some seed of what is goodly.

<p/>Returning from Germany, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had astonished the reading public by the
vigour of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts, put forth in the quaintest language. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
cannot write English, said the critics. No matter, said the public;
we can read what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does write, and that without yawning. And so Dr
Pessimist Anticant became popular. Popularity spoilt him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for all
further real use, as it has done many another. While, with some
diffidence, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) confined his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) objurgations to the occasional follies or
shortcomings of mankind; while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ridiculed the energy of the squire
devoted to the slaughter of partridges, or the mistake of some noble
patron who turned a poet into a gauger of beer-barrels, it was all
well; we were glad to be told our faults and to look forward to the
coming millennium, when all men, having sufficiently studied the works
of Dr Anticant, would become truthful and energetic. But the doctor
mistook the signs of the times and the minds of men, instituted
himself censor of things in general, and began the great task of
reprobating everything and everybody, without further promise of any
millennium at all. This was not so well; and, to tell the truth, our
author did not succeed in his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) undertaking. His (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) theories were all
beautiful, and the code of morals that he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) taught us certainly an
improvement on the practices of the age. We all of us could, and many
of us did, learn much from the doctor while he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) chose to remain vague,
mysterious, and cloudy: but when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) became practical, the charm was
gone.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) allusion to the poet and the partridges was received very well.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, my poor brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``slaughtered partridges a score of
brace to each gun, and poets gauging ale-barrels, with sixty pounds a
year, at Dumfries, are not the signs of a great era!--perhaps of the
smallest possible era yet written of. Whatever economies we pursue,
political or other, let us see at once that this is the maddest of the
uneconomic: partridges killed by our land magnates at, shall we say,
a guinea a head, to be retailed in Leadenhall at one shilling and
ninepence, with one poacher in limbo for every fifty birds! our poet,
maker, creator, gauging ale, and that badly, with no leisure for
making or creating, only a little leisure for drinking, and such like
beer-barrel avocations! Truly, a cutting of blocks with fine razors
while we scrape our chins so uncomfortably with rusty knives! Oh, my
political economist, master of supply and demand, division of labour
and high pressure--oh, my loud-speaking friend, tell me, if so much
be in you, what is the demand for poets in these kingdoms of Queen
Victoria, and what the vouchsafed supply?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This was all very well: this gave us some hope. We might do better
with our next poet, when we got one; and though the partridges might
not be abandoned, something could perhaps be done as to the poachers.
We were unwilling, however, to take lessons in politics from so
misty a professor; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) came to tell us that the heroes of
Westminster were naught, we began to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) had written enough.
His (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) attack upon despatch boxes was not thought to have much in it;
but as it is short, the doctor shall again be allowed to speak his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
sentiments.


<p/>Could utmost ingenuity in the management of red tape avail
anything to men lying gasping,--we may say, all but dead;
could despatch boxes with never-so-much velvet lining and
Chubb's patent be of comfort to a people _in extremis_, I
also, with so many others, would, with parched tongue, call
on the name of Lord John Russell; or, my brother, at your
advice, on Lord Aberdeen; or, my cousin, on Lord Derby, at
yours; being, with my parched tongue, indifferent to such
matters. ``Tis all one. Oh, Derby! Oh, Gladstone! Oh,
Palmerston! Oh, Lord John! Each comes running with serene
face and despatch box. Vain physicians! though there were
hosts of such, no despatch box will cure this disorder!
What! are there other doctors' new names, disciples who
have not burdened their souls with tape? Well, let us call
again. Oh, Disraeli, great oppositionist, man of the bitter
brow! or, Oh, Molesworth, great reformer, thou who promisest
Utopia. They come; each with that serene face, and each,--
alas, me! alas, my country!--each with a despatch box!

<p/>Oh, the serenity of Downing Street!

<p/>My brothers, when hope was over on the battle-field, when no
dimmest chance of victory remained, the ancient Roman could
hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) face within his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) toga, and die gracefully. Can you
and I do so now? If so, `twere best for us; if not, oh my
brothers, we must die disgracefully, for hope of life and
victory I see none left to us in this world below. I for
one cannot trust much to serene face and despatch box!


<p/>There might be truth in this, there might be depth of reasoning;
but Englishmen did not see enough in the argument to induce them
to withdraw their confidence from the present arrangements of the
government, and Dr Anticant's monthly pamphlet on the decay of the
world did not receive so much attention as his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) earlier works. He (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) did
not confine himself to politics in these publications, but roamed at
large over all matters of public interest, and found everything bad.
According to him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) nobody was true, and not only nobody, but nothing; a
man could not take off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat to a lady without telling a lie;--the
lady would lie again in smiling. The ruffles of the gentleman's
shirt would be fraught with deceit, and the lady's flounces full of
falsehood. Was ever anything more severe than that attack of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) on
chip bonnets, or the anathemas with which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) endeavoured to dust the
powder out of the bishops' wigs?

<p/>The pamphlet which Tom Towers now pushed across the table was entitled
<div class="bookquote">``Modern Charity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Towers/Towers</b></font>)</div>and was written with the view of proving how much in
the way of charity was done by our predecessors,--how little by the
present age; and it ended by a comparison between ancient and modern
times, very little to the credit of the latter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at this,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Towers, getting up and turning over the pages of
the pamphlet, and pointing to a passage near the end. <div class="bookquote">``Your friend
the warden, who is so little selfish, won't like that, I fear.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Bold
read as follows--


<p/>Heavens, what a sight! Let us with eyes wide open see the
godly man of four centuries since, the man of the dark ages;
let us see how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) godlike work, and, again, how the
godly man of these latter days does his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>Shall we say that the former is one walking painfully
through the world, regarding, as a prudent man, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) worldly
work, prospering in it as a diligent man will prosper, but
always with an eye to that better treasure to which thieves
do not creep in? Is there not much nobility in that old
man, as, leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) oaken staff, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walks down the High
Street of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) native town, and receives from all courteous
salutation and acknowledgment of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) worth? A noble old
man, my august inhabitants of Belgrave Square and such like
vicinity,--a very noble old man, though employed no better
than in the wholesale carding of wool.

<p/>This carding of wool, however, did in those days bring with
it much profit, so that our ancient friend, when dying,
was declared, in whatever slang then prevailed, to cut up
exceeding well. For sons and daughters there was ample
sustenance with assistance of due industry; for friends and
relatives some relief for grief at this great loss; for aged
dependents comfort in declining years. This was much for
one old man to get done in that dark fifteenth century. But
this was not all: coming generations of poor wool-carders
should bless the name of this rich one; and a hospital
should be founded and endowed with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wealth for the
feeding of such of the trade as could not, by diligent
carding, any longer duly feed themselves.

<p/>``Twas thus that an old man in the fifteenth century did his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
godlike work to the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power, and not ignobly, as
appears to me.

<p/>We will now take our godly man of latter days. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall no
longer be a wool-carder, for such are not now men of mark.
We will suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be one of the best of the good, one
who has lacked no opportunities. Our old friend was, after
all, but illiterate; our modern friend shall be a man
educated in all seemly knowledge; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall, in short, be
that blessed being,--a clergyman of the Church of England!

<p/>And now, in what perfectest manner does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in this lower
world get his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) godlike work done and put out of hand?
Heavens! in the strangest of manners. Oh, my brother! in a
manner not at all to be believed, but by the most minute
testimony of eyesight. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) does it by the magnitude of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
appetite,--by the power of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) gorge; his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) only occupation is
to swallow the bread prepared with so much anxious care for
these impoverished carders of wool,--that, and to sing
indifferently through his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) nose once in the week some psalm
more or less long,--the shorter the better, we should be
inclined to say.

<p/>Oh, my civilised friends!--great Britons that never will be
slaves, men advanced to infinite state of freedom and
knowledge of good and evil;--tell me, will you, what
becoming monument you will erect to an highly-educated
clergyman of the Church of England?


<p/>Bold certainly thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) friend would not like that: he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) could
not conceive anything that he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) would like less than this. To what a
world of toil and trouble had he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>), Bold, given rise by his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) indiscreet
attack upon the hospital!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Towers, ``that this affair has been much talked of, and
the public are with you. I am sorry you should give the matter up.
Have you seen the first number of <div class="bookquote">``The Almshouse'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No; Bold had not seen <div class="bookquote">``The Almshouse.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen advertisements
of Mr Popular Sentiment's new novel of that name, but had in no way
connected it with Barchester Hospital, and had never thought a moment
on the subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a direct attack on the whole system,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Towers. <div class="bookquote">``It'll go
a long way to put down Rochester, and Barchester, and Dulwich, and
St Cross, and all such hotbeds of peculation. It's very clear that
Sentiment has been down to Barchester, and got up the whole story
there; indeed, I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) must have had it all from you; it's very
well done, as you'll see: his (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) first numbers always are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr</b></font>)</div><p/>Bold declared that Mr Sentiment had got nothing from him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>)
was deeply grieved to find that the case had become so notorious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The fire has gone too far to be quenched,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Towers; <div class="bookquote">``the building
must go now; and as the timbers are all rotten, why, I should be
inclined to say, the sooner the better. I expected to see you get
some _éclat_ in the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was all wormwood to Bold. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) had done enough to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) friend
the warden miserable for life, and had then backed out just when the
success of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) project was sufficient to make the question one of real
interest. How weakly he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) had managed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) business! he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) had already
done the harm, and then stayed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) hand when the good which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) had in
view was to be commenced. How delightful would it have been to have
employed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) energy in such a cause,--to have been backed by _The
Jupiter_, and written up to by two of the most popular authors of the
day! The idea opened a view into the very world in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) wished
to live. To what might it not have given rise? what delightful
intimacies,--what public praise,--to what Athenian banquets and rich
flavour of Attic salt?

<p/>This, however, was now past hope. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) had pledged himself to abandon
the cause; and could he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) have forgotten the pledge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) had gone too far
to retreat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) was now, this moment, sitting in Tom Towers' room with
the object of deprecating any further articles in _The Jupiter_, and,
greatly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) disliked the job, his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) petition to that effect must be
made.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't continue it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``because I found I was in the
wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom Towers shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) shoulders. How could a successful man be in
the wrong! <div class="bookquote">``In that case,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``of course you must abandon it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I called this morning to ask you also to abandon it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To ask me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Towers/Towers</b></font>)</div>said Tom Towers, with the most placid of smiles, and a
consummate look of gentle surprise, as though Tom Towers was well
aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) of all men was the last to meddle in such matters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bold, almost trembling with hesitation. <div class="bookquote">''_The Jupiter_,
you know, has taken the matter up very strongly. Mr Harding has felt
what it has said deeply; and I thought that if I could explain to you
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) personally has not been to blame, these articles might be
discontinued.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom Towers/Towers</b></font>)</div><p/>How calmly impassive was Tom Towers' face, as this innocent little
proposition was made! Had Bold addressed himself to the doorposts in
Mount Olympus, they would have shown as much outward sign of assent or
dissent. His (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) quiescence was quite admirable; his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) discretion certainly
more than human.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>), when Bold had quite done speaking, <div class="bookquote">``I
really cannot answer for _The Jupiter_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John Bold/Bold</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you saw that these articles were unjust, I think that you
would endeavour to put a stop to them. Of course nobody doubts that
you could, if you chose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody and everybody are always very kind, but unfortunately are
generally very wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, Towers,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Bold/Bold</b></font>)</div>said Bold, plucking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) courage, and
remembering that for Eleanor's sake he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) was bound to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) best
exertion; <div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt in my own mind but that you wrote the
articles yourself, and very well written they were: it will be a great
favour if you will in future abstain from any personal allusion to
poor Harding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Bold,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Towers/Towers</b></font>)</div>said Tom Towers, <div class="bookquote">``I have a sincere regard for you.
I have known you for many years, and value your friendship; I hope
you will let me explain to you, without offence, that none who
are connected with the public press can with propriety listen to
interference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom Towers/Towers</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Interference!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bold, <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to interfere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but, my dear fellow, you do; what else is it? You think that I
am able to keep certain remarks out of a newspaper. Your information
is probably incorrect, as most public gossip on such subjects is; but,
at any rate, you think I have such power, and you ask me to use it:
now that is interference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if you choose to call it so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now suppose for a moment that I had this power, and used it as
you wish: isn't it clear that it would be a great abuse? Certain men
are employed in writing for the public press; and if they are induced
either to write or to abstain from writing by private motives,
surely the public press would soon be of little value. Look at the
recognised worth of different newspapers, and see if it does not
mainly depend on the assurance which the public feel that such a paper
is, or is not, independent. You alluded to _The Jupiter_: surely you
cannot but see that the weight of _The Jupiter_ is too great to be
moved by any private request, even though it should be made to a much
more influential person than myself: you've only to think of this, and
you'll see that I am right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom Towers/Towers</b></font>)</div><p/>The discretion of Tom Towers was boundless: there was no contradicting
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) said, no arguing against such propositions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) took such high
ground that there was no getting on to it. <div class="bookquote">``The public is defrauded,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``whenever private considerations are allowed to have weight.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Quite true, thou greatest oracle of the middle of the nineteenth
century, thou sententious proclaimer of the purity of the press;--the
public is defrauded when it is purposely misled. Poor public! how
often is it misled! against what a world of fraud has it to contend!

<p/>Bold took his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) leave, and got out of the room as quickly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) could,
inwardly denouncing his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) friend Tom Towers as a prig and a humbug. <div class="bookquote">``I
know he (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) wrote those articles,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bold to himself. <div class="bookquote">``I know he (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) got
his (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) information from me. He (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) was ready enough to take my word for
gospel when it suited his (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) own views, and to set Mr Harding up before
the public as an impostor on no other testimony than my chance
conversation; but when I offer him (<font color='blue'><b>impostor</b></font>) real evidence opposed to his (<font color='blue'><b>impostor</b></font>) own
views, he (<font color='blue'><b>impostor</b></font>) tells me that private motives are detrimental to public
justice! Confound his (<font color='blue'><b>impostor</b></font>) arrogance! What is any public question but a
conglomeration of private interests? What is any newspaper article
but an expression of the views taken by one side? Truth! it takes an
age to ascertain the truth of any question! The idea of Tom Towers
talking of public motives and purity of purpose! Why, it wouldn't
give him (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) a moment's uneasiness to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) politics to-morrow, if
the paper required it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John Bold/Bold</b></font>)</div><p/>Such were John Bold's inward exclamations as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) way out of
the quiet labyrinth of the Temple; and yet there was no position of
worldly power so coveted in Bold's ambition as that held by the man of
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was thinking. It was the impregnability of the place which
made Bold so angry with the possessor of it, and it was the same
quality which made it appear so desirable.

<p/>Passing into the Strand, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw in a bookseller's window an
announcement of the first number of <div class="bookquote">``The Almshouse;''  (<font color='red'><b>a bookseller</b></font>)</div>so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) purchased a
copy, and hurrying back to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lodgings, proceeded to ascertain what
Mr Popular Sentiment had to say to the public on the subject which had
lately occupied so much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) own attention.

<p/>In former times great objects were attained by great work. When evils
were to be reformed, reformers set about their heavy task with grave
decorum and laborious argument. An age was occupied in proving a
grievance, and philosophical researches were printed in folio pages,
which it took a life to write, and an eternity to read. We get on
now with a lighter step, and quicker: ridicule is found to be more
convincing than argument, imaginary agonies touch more than true
sorrows, and monthly novels convince, when learned quartos fail to
do so. If the world is to be set right, the work will be done by
shilling numbers.

<p/>Of all such reformers Mr Sentiment is the most powerful. It is
incredible the number of evil practices he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) has put down: it is to
be feared he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) will soon lack subjects, and that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) has made the
working classes comfortable, and got bitter beer put into proper-sized
pint bottles, there will be nothing further for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) left to do. Mr
Sentiment is certainly a very powerful man, and perhaps not the less
so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) good poor people are so very good; his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) hard rich people
so very hard; and the genuinely honest so very honest. Namby-pamby
in these days is not thrown away if it be introduced in the proper
quarters. Divine peeresses are no longer interesting, though
possessed of every virtue; but a pattern peasant or an immaculate
manufacturing hero may talk as much twaddle as one of Mrs Ratcliffe's
heroines, and still be listened to. Perhaps, however, Mr Sentiment's
great attraction is in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) second-rate characters. If his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) heroes and
heroines walk upon stilts, as heroes and heroines, I fear, ever must,
their attendant satellites are as natural as though one met them in
the street: they walk and talk like men and women, and live among our
friends a rattling, lively life; yes, live, and will live till the
names of their calling shall be forgotten in their own, and Buckett
and Mrs Gamp will be the only words left to us to signify a detective
police officer or a monthly nurse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Almshouse''  (<font color='red'><b>a clergyman</b></font>)</div>opened with a scene in a clergyman's house. Every
luxury to be purchased by wealth was described as being there: all the
appearances of household indulgence generally found amongst the most
self-indulgent of the rich were crowded into this abode. Here the
reader was introduced to the demon of the book, the Mephistopheles of
the drama. What story was ever written without a demon? What novel,
what history, what work of any sort, what world, would be perfect
without existing principles both of good and evil? The demon of <div class="bookquote">``The
Almshouse''  (<font color='red'><b>The demon</b></font>)</div>was the clerical owner of this comfortable abode. He (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) was
a man well stricken in years, but still strong to do evil: he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) was one
who looked cruelly out of a hot, passionate, bloodshot eye; who had a
huge red nose with a carbuncle, thick lips, and a great double, flabby
chin, which swelled out into solid substance, like a turkey-cock's
comb, when sudden anger inspired him (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) had a hot, furrowed, low
brow, from which a few grizzled hairs were not yet rubbed off by
the friction of his (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) handkerchief: he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) wore a loose unstarched white
handkerchief, black loose ill-made clothes, and huge loose shoes,
adapted to many corns and various bunions: his (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) husky voice told
tales of much daily port wine, and his (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) language was not so decorous
as became a clergyman. Such was the master of Mr Sentiment's
<div class="bookquote">``Almshouse.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) was a widower, but at present accompanied by two
daughters, and a thin and somewhat insipid curate. One of the young
ladies was devoted to her (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) father and the fashionable world, and she (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) of
course was the favourite; the other was equally addicted to Puseyism
and the curate.

<p/>The second chapter of course introduced the reader to the more
especial inmates of the hospital. Here were discovered eight old
men; and it was given to be understood that four vacancies remained
unfilled, through the perverse ill-nature of the clerical gentleman
with the double chin. The state of these eight paupers was touchingly
dreadful: sixpence-farthing a day had been sufficient for their diet
when the almshouse was founded; and on sixpence-farthing a day were
they still doomed to starve, though food was four times as dear,
and money four times as plentiful. It was shocking to find how the
conversation of these eight starved old men in their dormitory shamed
that of the clergyman's family in his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) rich drawing-room. The absolute
words they uttered were not perhaps spoken in the purest English, and
it might be difficult to distinguish from their dialect to what part
of the country they belonged; the beauty of the sentiment, however,
amply atoned for the imperfection of the language; and it was really a
pity that these eight old men could not be sent through the country as
moral missionaries, instead of being immured and starved in that
wretched almshouse.

<p/>Bold finished the number; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) threw it aside, he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) thought that
that at least had no direct appliance to Mr Harding, and that the
absurdly strong colouring of the picture would disenable the work from
doing either good or harm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was wrong. The artist who paints for
the million must use glaring colours, as no one knew better than Mr
Sentiment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) described the inhabitants of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) almshouse; and the
radical reform which has now swept over such establishments has owed
more to the twenty numbers of Mr Sentiment's novel, than to all the
true complaints which have escaped from the public for the last half
century.




<p/>Chapter XVI

<p/>A LONG DAY IN LONDON


<p/>The warden had to make use of all his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) very moderate powers of intrigue
to give his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) son-in-law the slip, and get out of Barchester without
being stopped on his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) road. No schoolboy ever ran away from school
with more precaution and more dread of detection; no convict, slipping
down from a prison wall, ever feared to see the gaoler more entirely
than Mr Harding did to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) son-in-law as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) drove up in the pony
carriage to the railway station, on the morning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) escape to
London.

<p/>The evening before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) went he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) wrote a note to the archdeacon,
explaining that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) should start on the morrow on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) journey; that
it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) intention to see the attorney-general if possible, and to
decide on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) future plans in accordance with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) heard from that
gentleman; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) excused himself for giving Dr Grantly no earlier notice,
by stating that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) resolve was very sudden; and having entrusted this
note to Eleanor, with the perfect, though not expressed, understanding
that it was to be sent over to Plumstead Episcopi without haste, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
took his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) departure.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) also prepared and carried with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) a note for Sir Abraham
Haphazard, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Haphazard</b></font>) stated his (<font color='blue'><b>Haphazard</b></font>) name, explaining that he (<font color='blue'><b>Haphazard</b></font>) was the
defendant in the case of <div class="bookquote">``The Queen on behalf of the Wool-carders of
Barchester _v_. Trustees under the will of the late John Hiram,''  (<font color='red'><b>the defendant</b></font>)</div>for
so was the suit denominated, and begged the illustrious and learned
gentleman to vouchsafe to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ten minutes' audience at any hour on the
next day. Mr Harding calculated that for that one day he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was safe;
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) son-in-law, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had no doubt, would arrive in town by an early
train, but not early enough to reach the truant till he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) should have
escaped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) hotel after breakfast; and could he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) thus manage to
see the lawyer on that very day, the deed might be done before the
archdeacon could interfere.

<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) arrival in town the warden drove, as was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) wont, to the
Chapter Hotel and Coffee House, near St Paul's. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) visits to London
of late had not been frequent; but in those happy days when <div class="bookquote">``Harding's
Church Music''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was going through the press, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had been often there;
and as the publisher's house was in Paternoster Row, and the printer's
press in Fleet Street, the Chapter Hotel and Coffee House had been
convenient. It was a quiet, sombre, clerical house, beseeming such
a man as the warden, and thus he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) afterwards frequented it. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
dared, he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) would on this occasion have gone elsewhere to throw the
archdeacon further off the scent; but he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) did not know what violent
steps his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) son-in-law might take for his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) recovery if he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) were not found
at his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) usual haunt, and he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) deemed it not prudent to make himself the
object of a hunt through London.

<p/>Arrived at his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) inn, he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) ordered dinner, and went forth to the
attorney-general's chambers. There he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) learnt that Sir Abraham was in
Court, and would not probably return that day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) would go direct
from Court to the House; all appointments were, as a rule, made at the
chambers; the clerk could by no means promise an interview for the
next day; was able, on the other hand, to say that such interview was,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) thought, impossible; but that Sir Abraham would certainly be at the
House in the course of the night, where an answer from himself might
possibly be elicited.

<p/>To the House Mr Harding went, and left his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) note, not finding Sir
Abraham there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) added a most piteous entreaty that he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) might be
favoured with an answer that evening, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) would return. He (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>)
then journeyed back sadly to the Chapter Coffee House, digesting his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>)
great thoughts, as best he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) might, in a clattering omnibus, wedged in
between a wet old lady and a journeyman glazier returning from his (<font color='blue'><b>glazier</b></font>)
work with his (<font color='blue'><b>glazier</b></font>) tools in his (<font color='blue'><b>glazier</b></font>) lap. In melancholy solitude he (<font color='blue'><b>glazier</b></font>) discussed
his (<font color='blue'><b>glazier</b></font>) mutton chop and pint of port. What is there in this world more
melancholy than such a dinner? A dinner, though eaten alone, in a
country hotel may be worthy of some energy; the waiter, if you are
known, will make much of you; the landlord will make you a bow and
perhaps put the fish on the table; if you ring you are attended to,
and there is some life about it. A dinner at a London eating-house is
also lively enough, if it have no other attraction. There is plenty
of noise and stir about it, and the rapid whirl of voices and rattle
of dishes disperses sadness. But a solitary dinner in an old,
respectable, sombre, solid London inn, where nothing makes any noise
but the old waiter's creaking shoes; where one plate slowly goes and
another slowly comes without a sound; where the two or three guests
would as soon think of knocking each other down as of speaking; where
the servants whisper, and the whole household is disturbed if an order
be given above the voice,--what can be more melancholy than a mutton
chop and a pint of port in such a place?

<p/>Having gone through this Mr Harding got into another omnibus, and
again returned to the House. Yes, Sir Abraham was there, and was
that moment on his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) legs, fighting eagerly for the hundred and seventh
clause of the Convent Custody Bill. Mr Harding's note had been
delivered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>); and if Mr Harding would wait some two or three
hours, Sir Abraham could be asked whether there was any answer.
The House was not full, and perhaps Mr Harding might get admittance
into the Strangers' Gallery, which admission, with the help of five
shillings, Mr Harding was able to effect.

<p/>This bill of Sir Abraham's had been read a second time and passed into
committee. A hundred and six clauses had already been discussed and
had occupied only four mornings and five evening sittings; nine of
the hundred and six clauses were passed, fifty-five were withdrawn
by consent, fourteen had been altered so as to mean the reverse of
the original proposition, eleven had been postponed for further
consideration, and seventeen had been directly negatived. The hundred
and seventh ordered the bodily searching of nuns for jesuitical
symbols by aged clergymen, and was considered to be the real mainstay
of the whole bill. No intention had ever existed to pass such a law
as that proposed, but the government did not intend to abandon it
till their object was fully attained by the discussion of this clause.
It was known that it would be insisted on with terrible vehemence by
Protestant Irish members, and as vehemently denounced by the Roman
Catholic; and it was justly considered that no further union between
the parties would be possible after such a battle. The innocent Irish
fell into the trap as they always do, and whiskey and poplins became a
drug in the market.

<p/>A florid-faced gentleman with a nice head of hair, from the south of
Ireland, had succeeded in catching the speaker's eye by the time that
Mr Harding had got into the gallery, and was denouncing the proposed
sacrilege, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) whole face glowing with a fine theatrical frenzy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And this is a Christian country?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>). -LRB-Loud cheers; counter
cheers from the ministerial benches. <div class="bookquote">``Some doubt as to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>from
a voice below the gangway.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``No, it can be no Christian country,
in which the head of the bar, the lagal adviser -LRB-loud laughter and
cheers-RRB---yes, I say the lagal adviser of the crown -LRB-great cheers and
laughter-RRB---can stand up in his (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) seat in this house -LRB-prolonged cheers
and laughter-RRB-, and attempt to lagalise indacent assaults on the bodies
of religious ladies.''  (<font color='red'><b>the member</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Deafening cheers and laughter, which were
prolonged till the honourable member resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) seat.-RRB-

<p/>When Mr Harding had listened to this and much more of the same kind
for about three hours, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) returned to the door of the House, and
received back from the messenger his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) own note, with the following
words scrawled in pencil on the back of it: <div class="bookquote">``To-morrow, 10 P.M.--my
chambers.--A. H.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the messenger note</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was so far successful;--but 10 P.M.: what an hour Sir Abraham had
named for a legal interview! Mr Harding felt perfectly sure that long
before that Dr Grantly would be in London. Dr Grantly could not,
however, know that this interview had been arranged, nor could he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
learn it unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) managed to get hold of Sir Abraham before that
hour; and as this was very improbable, Mr Harding determined to
start from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) hotel early, merely leaving word that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) should dine
out, and unless luck were much against him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) might still escape the
archdeacon till his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) return from the attorney-general's chambers.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was at breakfast at nine, and for the twentieth time consulted his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
Bradshaw, to see at what earliest hour Dr Grantly could arrive from
Barchester. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) examined the columns, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was nearly petrified
by the reflection that perhaps the archdeacon might come up by the
night-mail train! His (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) heart sank within him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) at the horrid idea,
and for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) felt himself dragged back to Barchester without
accomplishing any portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) object. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) remembered that had
Dr Grantly done so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) would have been in the hotel, looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
long since.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Waiter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), timidly.

<p/>The waiter approached, creaking in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) shoes, but voiceless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did any gentleman,--a clergyman, arrive here by the night-mail
train?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, not one,''  (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div>whispered the waiter, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) mouth nearly
close to the warden's ear.

<p/>Mr Harding was reassured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Waiter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) again, and the waiter again creaked up. <div class="bookquote">``If anyone
calls for me, I am going to dine out, and shall return about eleven
o'clock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The waiter</b></font>)</div><p/>The waiter nodded, but did not this time vouchsafe any reply; and Mr
Harding, taking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) hat, proceeded out to pass a long day in the
best way he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) could, somewhere out of sight of the archdeacon.

<p/>Bradshaw had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Bradshaw</b></font>) twenty times that Dr Grantly could not be at
Paddington station till 2 P.M., and our poor friend might therefore
have trusted to the shelter of the hotel for some hours longer with
perfect safety; but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was nervous. There was no knowing what steps
the archdeacon might take for his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) apprehension: a message by electric
telegraph might desire the landlord of the hotel to set a watch upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>); some letter might come which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) might find himself unable to
disobey; at any rate, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could not feel himself secure in any place
at which the archdeacon could expect to find him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>); and at 10 A.M. he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
started forth to spend twelve hours in London.

<p/>Mr Harding had friends in town had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) chosen to seek them; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) felt
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was in no humour for ordinary calls, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) did not now wish
to consult with anyone as to the great step which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had determined
to take. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) daughter, no one knows where the shoe
pinches but the wearer. There are some points on which no man can be
contented to follow the advice of another,--some subjects on which
a man can consult his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own conscience only. Our warden had made up
his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) mind that it was good for him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) at any cost to get rid of this
grievance; his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) daughter was the only person whose concurrence appeared
necessary to him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) did concur with him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) most heartily. Under
such circumstances he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) would not, if he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) could help it, consult anyone
further, till advice would be useless. Should the archdeacon catch
him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>), indeed, there would be much advice, and much consultation of a
kind not to be avoided; but he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) hoped better things; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) felt
that he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) could not now converse on indifferent subjects, he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) resolved
to see no one till after his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) interview with the attorney-general.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) determined to take sanctuary in Westminster Abbey, so he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) again went
thither in an omnibus, and finding that the doors were not open for
morning service, he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) paid his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) twopence, and went in as a sightseer.
It occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had no definite place of rest for the day,
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) should be absolutely worn out before his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) interview if he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
attempted to walk about from 10 A.M. to 10 P.M., so he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) sat himself
down on a stone step, and gazed up at the figure of William Pitt, who
looks as though he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had just entered the church for the first time in
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) life and was anything but pleased at finding himself there.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had been sitting unmolested about twenty minutes when the verger
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) whether he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) wouldn't like to walk round. Mr Harding didn't
want to walk anywhere, and declined, merely observing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was
waiting for the morning service. The verger, seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was a
clergyman, told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) that the doors of the choir were now open, and
showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) into a seat. This was a great point gained; the archdeacon
would certainly not come to morning service at Westminster Abbey, even
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) were in London; and here the warden could rest quietly, and,
when the time came, duly say his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) prayers.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) longed to get up from his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) seat, and examine the music-books of the
choristers, and the copy of the litany from which the service was
chanted, to see how far the little details at Westminster corresponded
with those at Barchester, and whether he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) thought his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) own voice would
fill the church well from the Westminster precentor's seat. There
would, however, be impropriety in such meddling, and he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) sat perfectly
still, looking up at the noble roof, and guarding against the coming
fatigues of the day.

<p/>By degrees two or three people entered; the very same damp old woman
who had nearly obliterated him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) in the omnibus, or some other just like
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); a couple of young ladies with their veils down, and gilt crosses
conspicuous on their prayer-books; an old man on crutches; a party who
were seeing the abbey, and thought they might as well hear the service
for their twopence, as opportunity served; and a young woman with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
prayer-book done up in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) handkerchief, who rushed in late, and, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hurried entry, tumbled over one of the forms, and made such a
noise that everyone, even the officiating minor canon, was startled,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) herself was so frightened by the echo of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own catastrophe
that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was nearly thrown into fits by the panic.

<p/>Mr Harding was not much edified by the manner of the service. The
minor canon in question hurried in, somewhat late, in a surplice not
in the neatest order, and was followed by a dozen choristers, who were
also not as trim as they might have been: they all jostled into their
places with a quick hurried step, and the service was soon commenced.
Soon commenced and soon over,--for there was no music, and time was
not unnecessarily lost in the chanting. On the whole Mr Harding was
of opinion that things were managed better at Barchester, though even
there he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) knew that there was room for improvement.

<p/>It appears to us a question whether any clergyman can go through our
church service with decorum, morning after morning, in an immense
building, surrounded by not more than a dozen listeners. The best
actors cannot act well before empty benches, and though there is, of
course, a higher motive in one case than the other, still even the
best of clergymen cannot but be influenced by their audience; and to
expect that a duty should be well done under such circumstances, would
be to require from human nature more than human power.

<p/>When the two ladies with the gilt crosses, the old man with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
crutch, and the still palpitating housemaid were going, Mr Harding
found himself obliged to go too. The verger stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) way, and
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) and looked at the door, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) went. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) returned
again in a few minutes, and re-entered with another twopence. There
was no other sanctuary so good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>).

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) walked slowly down the nave, and then up one aisle, and then
again down the nave and up the other aisle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) tried to think gravely
of the step he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was about to take. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was going to give up eight
hundred a year voluntarily; and doom himself to live for the rest of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) life on about a hundred and fifty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had hitherto
failed to realise this fact as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) ought to do. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) maintain
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) own independence and support his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) daughter on a hundred and fifty
pounds a year without being a burden on anyone? His (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) son-in-law was
rich, but nothing could induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) to lean on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) son-in-law after
acting, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) intended to do, in direct opposition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) son-in-law's
counsel. The bishop was rich, but he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was about to throw away the
bishop's best gift, and that in a manner to injure materially the
patronage of the giver: he (<font color='blue'><b>giver</b></font>) could neither expect nor accept anything
further from the bishop. There would be not only no merit, but
positive disgrace, in giving up his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) wardenship, if he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) were not
prepared to meet the world without it. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) must from this time
forward bound all his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) human wishes for himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) daughter to
the poor extent of so limited an income. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) had not thought
sufficiently of this, that he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) had been carried away by enthusiasm,
and had hitherto not brought home to himself the full reality of his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
position.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) thought most about his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) daughter, naturally. It was true that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
was engaged, and he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) knew enough of his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) proposed son-in-law to be sure
that his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) own altered circumstances would make no obstacle to such a
marriage; nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was sure that the very fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) poverty would
induce Bold more anxiously to press the matter; but he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) disliked
counting on Bold in this emergency, brought on, as it had been, by
his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) doing. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) did not like saying to himself, Bold has turned me
out of my house and income, and, therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) must relieve me of my
daughter; he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) preferred reckoning on Eleanor as the companion of his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
poverty and exile,--as the sharer of his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) small income.

<p/>Some modest provision for his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) daughter had been long since made. His (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
life was insured for three thousand pounds, and this sum was to go to
Eleanor. The archdeacon, for some years past, had paid the premium,
and had secured himself by the immediate possession of a small
property which was to have gone to Mrs Grantly after her (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>) father's
death. This matter, therefore, had been taken out of the warden's
hands long since, as, indeed, had all the business transactions of
his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) family, and his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) anxiety was, therefore, confined to his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) own life
income.

<p/>Yes. A hundred and fifty per annum was very small, but still it might
suffice; but how was he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) to chant the litany at the cathedral on Sunday
mornings, and get the service done at Crabtree Parva? True, Crabtree
Church was not quite a mile and a half from the cathedral; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Crabtree</b></font>)
could not be in two places at once. Crabtree was a small village,
and afternoon service might suffice, but still this went against his (<font color='blue'><b>Crabtree</b></font>)
conscience; it was not right that his (<font color='blue'><b>Crabtree</b></font>) parishioners should be robbed
of any of their privileges on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crabtree</b></font>) poverty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crabtree</b></font>) might, to
be sure, make some arrangements for doing week-day service at the
cathedral; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Crabtree</b></font>) had chanted the litany at Barchester so long, and
had a conscious feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crabtree</b></font>) did it so well, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crabtree</b></font>) was unwilling
to give up the duty.

<p/>Thinking of such things, turning over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crabtree</b></font>) own mind together small
desires and grave duties, but never hesitating for a moment as to the
necessity of leaving the hospital, Mr Harding walked up and down the
abbey, or sat still meditating on the same stone step, hour after
hour. One verger went and another came, but they did not disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>);
every now and then they crept up and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), but they did so
with a reverential stare, and, on the whole, Mr Harding found his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
retreat well chosen. About four o'clock his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) comfort was disturbed
by an enemy in the shape of hunger. It was necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) should
dine, and it was clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) could not dine in the abbey: so he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) left
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) sanctuary not willingly, and betook himself to the neighbourhood
of the Strand to look for food.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) eyes had become so accustomed to the gloom of the church, that
they were dazed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) got out into the full light of day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
felt confused and ashamed of himself, as though people were staring at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) hurried along, still in dread of the archdeacon, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) came
to Charing Cross, and then remembered that in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) passages
through the Strand he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had seen the words <div class="bookquote">``Chops and Steaks''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>on a
placard in a shop window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) remembered the shop distinctly; it was
next door to a trunk-seller's, and there was a cigar shop on the other
side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) couldn't go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) hotel for dinner, which to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) hitherto
was the only known mode of dining in London at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) own expense; and,
therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) would get a steak at the shop in the Strand. Archdeacon
Grantly would certainly not come to such a place for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) dinner.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) found the house easily,--just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had observed it, between the
trunks and the cigars. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was rather daunted by the huge quantity
of fish which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) saw in the window. There were barrels of oysters,
hecatombs of lobsters, a few tremendous-looking crabs, and a tub full
of pickled salmon; not, however, being aware of any connection between
shell-fish and iniquity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) entered, and modestly asked a slatternly
woman, who was picking oysters out of a great watery reservoir,
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) could have a mutton chop and a potato.

<p/>The woman looked somewhat surprised, but answered in the affirmative,
and a slipshod girl ushered him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) into a long back room, filled with
boxes for the accommodation of parties, in one of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
seat. In a more miserably forlorn place he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) could not have found
himself: the room smelt of fish, and sawdust, and stale tobacco smoke,
with a slight taint of escaped gas; everything was rough and dirty,
and disreputable; the cloth which they put before him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was abominable;
the knives and forks were bruised, and hacked, and filthy; and
everything was impregnated with fish. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had one comfort, however:
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was quite alone; there was no one there to look on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) dismay; nor
was it probable that anyone would come to do so. It was a London
supper-house. About one o'clock at night the place would be lively
enough, but at the present time his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) seclusion was as deep as it had
been in the abbey.

<p/>In about half an hour the untidy girl, not yet dressed for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) evening
labours, brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) chop and potatoes, and Mr Harding begged for
a pint of sherry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was impressed with an idea, which was generally
prevalent a few years since, and is not yet wholly removed from the
minds of men, that to order a dinner at any kind of inn, without also
ordering a pint of wine for the benefit of the landlord, was a kind of
fraud,--not punishable, indeed, by law, but not the less abominable
on that account. Mr Harding remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) coming poverty, and
would willingly have saved his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) half-crown, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had no
alternative; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was soon put in possession of some horrid mixture
procured from the neighbouring public-house.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) chop and potatoes, however, were eatable, and having got over
as best he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) might the disgust created by the knives and forks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
contrived to swallow his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) dinner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was not much disturbed: one
young man, with pale face and watery fishlike eyes, wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat
ominously on one side, did come in and stare at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and ask the
girl, audibly enough, <div class="bookquote">``Who that old cock was;''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>but the annoyance went
no further, and the warden was left seated on his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) wooden bench in
peace, endeavouring to distinguish the different scents arising from
lobsters, oysters, and salmon.

<p/>Unknowing as Mr Harding was in the ways of London, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had
somehow selected an ineligible dining-house, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had better
leave it. It was hardly five o'clock;--how was he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) to pass the time
till ten? Five miserable hours! He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was already tired, and it was
impossible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) should continue walking so long. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) thought of
getting into an omnibus, and going out to Fulham for the sake of
coming back in another: this, however, would be weary work, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) bill to the woman in the shop, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) if there were any
place near where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) could get a cup of coffee. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did keep a
shellfish supper-house, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was very civil, and directed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) to the
cigar divan on the other side of the street.

<p/>Mr Harding had not a much correcter notion of a cigar divan than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
had of a London dinner-house, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was desperately in want of rest,
and went as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was directed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) must have made some
mistake when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) found himself in a cigar shop, but the man behind the
counter saw immediately that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a stranger, and understood what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wanted. <div class="bookquote">``One shilling, sir,--thank ye, sir,--cigar, sir?--ticket for
coffee, sir;--you'll only have to call the waiter. Up those stairs,
if you please, sir. Better take the cigar, sir,--you can always give
it to a friend, you know. Well, sir, thank ye, sir;--as you are so
good, I'll smoke it myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div>And so Mr Harding ascended to the divan,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) ticket for coffee, but minus the cigar.

<p/>The place seemed much more suitable to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) requirements than the
room in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had dined: there was, to be sure, a strong smell of
tobacco, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was not accustomed; but after the shell-fish, the
tobacco did not seem disagreeable. There were quantities of books,
and long rows of sofas. What on earth could be more luxurious than a
sofa, a book, and a cup of coffee? An old waiter came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>), with
a couple of magazines and an evening paper. Was ever anything so
civil? Would he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) have a cup of coffee, or would he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) prefer sherbet?
Sherbet! Was he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) absolutely in an Eastern divan, with the slight
addition of all the London periodicals? He (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) had, however, an idea that
sherbet should be drunk sitting cross-legged, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) was not quite
up to this, he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) ordered the coffee.

<p/>The coffee came, and was unexceptionable. Why, this divan was a
paradise! The civil old waiter suggested to him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) a game of chess:
though a chess player he (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) was not equal to this, so he (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) declined, and,
putting up his (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) weary legs on the sofa, leisurely sipped his (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) coffee,
and turned over the pages of his (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) Blackwood. He (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) might have been so
engaged for about an hour, for the old waiter enticed him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) to a second
cup of coffee, when a musical clock began to play. Mr Harding then
closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) magazine, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) place with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) finger, and lay,
listening with closed eyes to the clock. Soon the clock seemed to
turn into a violoncello, with piano accompaniments, and Mr Harding
began to fancy the old waiter was the Bishop of Barchester; he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) was
inexpressibly shocked that the bishop should have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>)
coffee with his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) own hands; then Dr Grantly came in, with a basket full
of lobsters, which he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) would not be induced to leave downstairs in the
kitchen; and then the warden couldn't quite understand why so many
people would smoke in the bishop's drawing-room; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) fell fast
asleep, and his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) dreams wandered away to his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) accustomed stall in
Barchester Cathedral, and the twelve old men he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was so soon about to
leave for ever.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was fatigued, and slept soundly for some time. Some sudden stop in
the musical clock woke him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) at length, and he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) jumped up with a start,
surprised to find the room quite full: it had been nearly empty when
his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) nap began. With nervous anxiety he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) watch, and
found that it was half-past nine. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) seized his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) hat, and, hurrying
downstairs, started at a rapid pace for Lincoln's Inn.

<p/>It still wanted twenty minutes to ten when the warden found himself
at the bottom of Sir Abraham's stairs, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) walked leisurely up and
down the quiet inn to cool himself. It was a beautiful evening at
the end of August. He (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) had recovered from his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) fatigue; his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) sleep and
the coffee had refreshed him (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) was surprised to find that he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>)
was absolutely enjoying himself, when the inn clock struck ten. The
sound was hardly over before he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) knocked at Sir Abraham's door, and
was informed by the clerk who received him (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) that the great man would
be with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) immediately.




<p/>Chapter XVII

<p/>SIR ABRAHAM HAPHAZARD


<p/>Mr Harding was shown into a comfortable inner sitting-room, looking
more like a gentleman's book-room than a lawyer's chambers, and there
waited for Sir Abraham. Nor was he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) kept waiting long: in ten or
fifteen minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) heard a clatter of voices speaking quickly in the
passage, and then the attorney-general entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very sorry to keep you waiting, Mr Warden,''  (<font color='red'><b>Abraham/Abraham Haphazard/ABRAHAM</b></font>)</div>said Sir Abraham, shaking
hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``and sorry, too, to name so disagreeable an hour;
but your notice was short, and as you said to-day, I named the very
earliest hour that was not disposed of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Harding assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was aware that it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) that should
apologise.

<p/>Sir Abraham was a tall thin man, with hair prematurely gray, but
bearing no other sign of age; he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) had a slight stoop, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) neck
rather than his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) back, acquired by his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) constant habit of leaning
forward as he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) addressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) various audiences. He (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) might be fifty
years old, and would have looked young for his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) age, had not constant
work hardened his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) features, and given him (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) the appearance of a machine
with a mind. His (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) face was full of intellect, but devoid of natural
expression. You would say he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) was a man to use, and then have done
with; a man to be sought for on great emergencies, but ill-adapted for
ordinary services; a man whom you would ask to defend your property,
but to whom you would be sorry to confide your love. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was bright
as a diamond, and as cutting, and also as unimpressionable. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew
everyone whom to know was an honour, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was without a friend; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wanted none, however, and knew not the meaning of the word in other
than its parliamentary sense. A friend! Had he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) not always been
sufficient to himself, and now, at fifty, was it likely that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should
trust another? He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was married, indeed, and had children, but what
time had he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) for the soft idleness of conjugal felicity? His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) working
days or term times were occupied from his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) time of rising to the late
hour at which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) went to rest, and even his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) vacations were more full
of labour than the busiest days of other men. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) never quarrelled
with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife, but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) never talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>);--he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) never had time to talk,
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was so taken up with speaking. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), poor lady, was not unhappy;
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had all that money could give her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would probably live to be
a peeress, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) really thought Sir Abraham the best of husbands.

<p/>Sir Abraham was a man of wit, and sparkled among the brightest at
the dinner-tables of political grandees: indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) always sparkled;
whether in society, in the House of Commons, or the courts of law,
coruscations flew from him (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>); glittering sparkles, as from hot steel,
but no heat; no cold heart was ever cheered by warmth from him (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>), no
unhappy soul ever dropped a portion of its burden at his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) door.

<p/>With him (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) success alone was praiseworthy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) knew none so
successful as himself. No one had thrust him (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) forward; no powerful
friends had pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) along on his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) road to power. No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) was
attorney-general, and would, in all human probability, be lord
chancellor by sheer dint of his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) own industry and his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) own talent. Who
else in all the world rose so high with so little help? A premier,
indeed! Who had ever been premier without mighty friends? An
archbishop! Yes, the son or grandson of a great noble, or else,
probably, his (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) tutor. But he (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>), Sir Abraham, had had no mighty lord
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) back; his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) father had been a country apothecary, his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) mother a
farmer's daughter. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) respect any but himself? And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>)
glitters along through the world, the brightest among the bright; and
when his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) glitter is gone, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) is gathered to his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) fathers, no eye
will be dim with a tear, no heart will mourn for its lost friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so, Mr Warden,''  (<font color='red'><b>Abraham/Abraham Haphazard/ABRAHAM</b></font>)</div>said Sir Abraham, <div class="bookquote">``all our trouble about this
lawsuit is at an end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Abraham/Abraham Haphazard/ABRAHAM</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Harding said he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) hoped so, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) didn't at all understand what Sir
Abraham meant. Sir Abraham, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) sharpness, could not have
looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) heart and read his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) intentions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All over. You need trouble yourself no further about it; of course
they must pay the costs, and the absolute expense to you and Dr
Grantly will be trifling,--that is, compared with what it might have
been if it had been continued.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear I don't quite understand you, Sir Abraham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you know that their attorneys have noticed us that they have
withdrawn the suit?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Harding explained to the lawyer that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) knew nothing of this,
although he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had heard in a roundabout way that such an intention had
been talked of; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) also at length succeeded in making Sir Abraham
understand that even this did not satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>). The attorney-general
stood up, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) breeches' pockets, and raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>)
eyebrows, as Mr Harding proceeded to detail the grievance from which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) now wished to rid himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know I have no right to trouble you personally with this matter,
but as it is of most vital importance to me, as all my happiness is
concerned in it, I thought I might venture to seek your advice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Abraham/Abraham Haphazard/ABRAHAM</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Abraham bowed, and declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) clients were entitled to the best
advice he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) could give them; particularly a client so respectable in
every way as the Warden of Barchester Hospital.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A spoken word, Sir Abraham, is often of more value than volumes of
written advice. The truth is, I am ill-satisfied with this matter
as it stands at present. I do see--I cannot help seeing, that the
affairs of the hospital are not arranged according to the will of the
founder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None of such institutions are, Mr Harding, nor can they be; the
altered circumstances in which we live do not admit of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite true--that is quite true; but I can't see that those altered
circumstances give me a right to eight hundred a year. I don't know
whether I ever read John Hiram's will, but were I to read it now I
could not understand it. What I want you, Sir Abraham, to tell me,
is this:--am I, as warden, legally and distinctly entitled to the
proceeds of the property, after the due maintenance of the twelve
bedesmen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Abraham/Abraham Haphazard/ABRAHAM</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Abraham declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) couldn't exactly say in so many words
that Mr Harding was legally entitled to, &c., &c., &c., and ended in
expressing a strong opinion that it would be madness to raise any
further question on the matter, as the suit was to be,--nay, was,
abandoned.

<p/>Mr Harding, seated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) chair, began to play a slow tune on an
imaginary violoncello.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, my dear sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the attorney-general</b></font>)</div>continued the attorney-general, <div class="bookquote">``there is no
further ground for any question; I don't see that you have the power
of raising it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the attorney-general</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can resign,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div>said Mr Harding, slowly playing away with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) right
hand, as though the bow were beneath the chair in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was
sitting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! throw it up altogether?''  (<font color='red'><b>the attorney-general</b></font>)</div>said the attorney-general, gazing with
utter astonishment at his (<font color='blue'><b>attorney-general</b></font>) client.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you see those articles in _The Jupiter_?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div>said Mr Harding,
piteously, appealing to the sympathy of the lawyer.

<p/>Sir Abraham said he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) had seen them. This poor little clergyman, cowed
into such an act of extreme weakness by a newspaper article, was to
Sir Abraham so contemptible an object, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) hardly knew how to talk
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) as to a rational being.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hadn't you better wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``till Dr Grantly is in town with
you? Wouldn't it be better to postpone any serious step till you can
consult with him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Harding declared vehemently that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) could not wait, and Sir Abraham
began seriously to doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) sanity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>said the latter, <div class="bookquote">``if you have private means sufficient
for your wants, and if this--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't a sixpence, Sir Abraham,''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>said the warden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless me! Why, Mr Harding, how do you mean to live?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Harding proceeded to explain to the man of law that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) meant to
keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) precentorship,--that was eighty pounds a year; and, also,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) meant to fall back upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) own little living of Crabtree,
which was another eighty pounds. That, to be sure, the duties of the
two were hardly compatible; but perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) might effect an exchange.
And then, recollecting that the attorney-general would hardly care to
hear how the service of a cathedral church is divided among the minor
canons, stopped short in his (<font color='blue'><b>attorney-general</b></font>) explanations.

<p/>Sir Abraham listened in pitying wonder. <div class="bookquote">``I really think, Mr Harding,
you had better wait for the archdeacon. This is a most serious
step,--one for which, in my opinion, there is not the slightest
necessity; and, as you have done me the honour of asking my advice, I
must implore you to do nothing without the approval of your friends.
A man is never the best judge of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own position.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A man is the best judge of what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feels himself. I'd sooner beg my
bread till my death than read such another article as those two that
have appeared, and feel, as I do, that the writer has truth on his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>)
side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you not a daughter, Mr Harding--an unmarried daughter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>), now standing also, but still playing away on his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>)
fiddle with his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) hand behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) back. <div class="bookquote">``I have, Sir Abraham; and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
and I are completely agreed on this subject.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray excuse me, Mr Harding, if what I say seems impertinent; but
surely it is you that should be prudent on her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) behalf. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is young,
and does not know the meaning of living on an income of a hundred and
sixty pounds a year. On her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) account give up this idea. Believe me,
it is sheer Quixotism.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The warden</b></font>)</div><p/>The warden walked away to the window, and then back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) chair; and
then, irresolute what to say, took another turn to the window. The
attorney-general was really extremely patient, but he (<font color='blue'><b>attorney-general</b></font>) was beginning to
think that the interview had been long enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if this income be not justly mine, what if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) and I have both to
beg?''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>said the warden at last, sharply, and in a voice so different
from that he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had hitherto used, that Sir Abraham was startled. <div class="bookquote">``If
so, it would be better to beg.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear sir, nobody now questions its justness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Sir Abraham, one does question it,--the most important of all
witnesses against me;--I question it myself. My God knows whether or
no I love my daughter; but I would sooner that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) and I should both
beg, than that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) should live in comfort on money which is truly the
property of the poor. It may seem strange to you, Sir Abraham, it is
strange to myself, that I should have been ten years in that happy
home, and not have thought of these things till they were so roughly
dinned into my ears. I cannot boast of my conscience, when it
required the violence of a public newspaper to awaken it; but, now
that it is awake, I must obey it. When I came here, I did not know
that the suit was withdrawn by Mr Bold, and my object was to beg
you to abandon my defence. As there is no action, there can be no
defence; but it is, at any rate, as well that you should know that
from to-morrow I shall cease to be the warden of the hospital. My
friends and I differ on this subject, Sir Abraham, and that adds much
to my sorrow; but it cannot be helped.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) finished what he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>)
had to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) played up such a tune as never before had graced the
chambers of any attorney-general. He (<font color='blue'><b>attorney-general</b></font>) was standing up, gallantly
fronting Sir Abraham, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) right arm passed with bold and rapid
sweeps before him (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>), as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) were embracing some huge instrument,
which allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) to stand thus erect; and with the fingers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>)
left hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) stopped, with preternatural velocity, a multitude of
strings, which ranged from the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) collar to the bottom of
the lappet of his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) coat. Sir Abraham listened and looked in wonder.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) had never before seen Mr Harding, the meaning of these wild
gesticulations was lost upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) perceived that the gentleman
who had a few minutes since been so subdued as to be unable to speak
without hesitation, was now impassioned,--nay, almost violent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll sleep on this, Mr Harding, and to-morrow--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have done more than sleep upon it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>said the warden; <div class="bookquote">``I have lain
awake upon it, and that night after night. I found I could not sleep
upon it: now I hope to do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div><p/>The attorney-general had no answer to make to this; so he (<font color='blue'><b>attorney-general</b></font>) expressed
a quiet hope that whatever settlement was finally made would be
satisfactory; and Mr Harding withdrew, thanking the great man for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) kind attention.

<p/>Mr Harding was sufficiently satisfied with the interview to feel a
glow of comfort as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) descended into the small old square of Lincoln's
Inn. It was a calm, bright, beautiful night, and by the light of
the moon, even the chapel of Lincoln's Inn, and the sombre row of
chambers, which surround the quadrangle, looked well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) stood still
a moment to collect his (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) thoughts, and reflect on what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) had done,
and was about to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) knew that the attorney-general regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>)
as little better than a fool, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) did not mind; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) and the
attorney-general had not much in common between them; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) knew also
that others, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) did care about, would think so too; but Eleanor,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) was sure, would exult in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) had done, and the bishop, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
trusted, would sympathise with him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>).

<p/>In the meantime he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) had to meet the archdeacon, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) walked slowly
down Chancery Lane and along Fleet Street, feeling sure that his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) work
for the night was not yet over. When he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) reached the hotel he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) rang the
bell quietly, and with a palpitating heart; he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) almost longed to escape
round the corner, and delay the coming storm by a further walk round
St Paul's Churchyard, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heard the slow creaking shoes of the old
waiter approaching, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stood his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ground manfully.




<p/>Chapter XVIII

<p/>THE WARDEN IS VERY OBSTINATE


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dr Grantly is here, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>greeted his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ears before the door was well
open, <div class="bookquote">``and Mrs Grantly. They have a sitting-room above, and are
waiting up for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something in the tone of the man's voice which seemed to
indicate that even he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked upon the warden as a runaway schoolboy,
just recaptured by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guardian, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pitied the culprit,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not but be horrified at the crime.

<p/>The warden endeavoured to appear unconcerned, as he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed!
I'll go upstairs at once;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) failed signally. There was,
perhaps, a ray of comfort in the presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) married daughter;
that is to say, of comparative comfort, seeing that his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) son-in-law
was there; but how much would he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) have preferred that they should both
have been safe at Plumstead Episcopi! However, upstairs he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) went,
the waiter slowly preceding him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>); and on the door being opened the
archdeacon was discovered standing in the middle of the room, erect,
indeed, as usual, but oh! how sorrowful! and on the dingy sofa behind
him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) reclined his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) patient wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa, I thought you were never coming back,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady; <div class="bookquote">``it's
twelve o'clock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>said the warden. <div class="bookquote">``The attorney-general named ten for
my meeting; to be sure ten is late, but what could I do, you know?
Great men will have their own way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) daughter a kiss, and shook hands with the doctor, and
again tried to look unconcerned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have absolutely been with the attorney-general?''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>asked the
archdeacon.

<p/>Mr Harding signified that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens, how unfortunate!''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>And the archdeacon raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) huge
hands in the manner in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) friends are so accustomed to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
express disapprobation and astonishment. <div class="bookquote">``What will Sir Abraham think
of it? Did you not know that it is not customary for clients to go
direct to their counsel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>asked the warden, innocently. <div class="bookquote">``Well, at any rate, I've
done it now. Sir Abraham didn't seem to think it so very strange.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The archdeacon</b></font>)</div><p/>The archdeacon gave a sigh that would have moved a man-of-war.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, papa, what did you say to Sir Abraham?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>asked the lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>), my dear, to explain John Hiram's will to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>)
couldn't explain it in the only way which would have satisfied me,
and so I resigned the wardenship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Resigned it!''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>said the archdeacon, in a solemn voice, sad and low,
but yet sufficiently audible,--a sort of whisper that Macready would
have envied, and the galleries have applauded with a couple of rounds.
<div class="bookquote">``Resigned it! Good heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>the dignitary</b></font>)</div>And the dignitary of the church sank
back horrified into a horsehair arm-chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At least I told Sir Abraham that I would resign; and of course I must
now do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>said the archdeacon, catching a ray of hope. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing
that you say in such a way to your own counsel can be in any way
binding on you; of course you were there to ask his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) advice. I'm sure
Sir Abraham did not advise any such step.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Harding could not say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) disadvised you from it,''  (<font color='red'><b>reverend</b></font>)</div>continued the reverend
cross-examiner.

<p/>Mr Harding could not deny this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure Sir Abraham must have advised you to consult your friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div><p/>To this proposition also Mr Harding was obliged to assent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then your threat of resignation amounts to nothing, and we are just
where we were before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Harding was now standing on the rug, moving uneasily from one foot
to the other. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) made no distinct answer to the archdeacon's last
proposition, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) mind was chiefly engaged on thinking how he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) could
escape to bed. That his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) resignation was a thing finally fixed on, a
fact all but completed, was not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) mind a matter of any doubt; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) own weakness; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) knew how prone he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was to be led; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was
not weak enough to give way now, to go back from the position to which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) conscience had driven him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), after having purposely come to London
to declare his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) determination: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) did not in the least doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
resolution, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) greatly doubted his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) power of defending it against
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) son-in-law.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must be very tired, Susan,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``wouldn't you like to go to
bed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But Susan didn't want to go till her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) husband went. She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) had an idea
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) papa might be bullied if she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) were away: she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) wasn't tired at
all, or at least she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) said so.

<p/>The archdeacon was pacing the room, expressing, by certain nods of his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
head, his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) opinion of the utter fatuity of his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) father-in-law.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>at last he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) said,--and angels might have blushed at the rebuke
expressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) tone and emphasis,--<div class="bookquote">``Why did you go off from
Barchester so suddenly? Why did you take such a step without giving
us notice, after what had passed at the palace?''

 (<font color='red'><b>angels</b></font>)</div><p/>The warden hung his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) head, and made no reply: he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) could not condescend
to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had not intended to give his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) son-in-law the slip; and
as he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had not the courage to avow it, he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) said nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa has been too much for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady.

<p/>The archdeacon took another turn, and again ejaculated, <div class="bookquote">``Good
heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>The archdeacon</b></font>)</div>this time in a very low whisper, but still audible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I'll go to bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>said the warden, taking up a side candle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate, you'll promise me to take no further step without
consultation,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>said the archdeacon. Mr Harding made no answer, but
slowly proceeded to light his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) candle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued the other, <div class="bookquote">``such a declaration as that you made
to Sir Abraham means nothing. Come, warden, promise me this. The
whole affair, you see, is already settled, and that with very little
trouble or expense. Bold has been compelled to abandon his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) action,
and all you have to do is to remain quiet at the hospital.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div>Mr
Harding still made no reply, but looked meekly into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) son-in-law's
face. The archdeacon thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) father-in-law, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was
mistaken; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had already talked over a vacillating man
to resign his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) promise. <div class="bookquote">``Come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``promise Susan to give up
this idea of resigning the wardenship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The warden looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) daughter, thinking probably at the moment
that if Eleanor were contented with him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) need not so much regard
his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) other child, and said, <div class="bookquote">``I am sure Susan will not ask me to break
my word, or to do what I know to be wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>child</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it would be madness in you to throw up your
preferment. What are you to live on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God, that feeds the young ravens, will take care of me also,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div>said Mr
Harding, with a smile, as though afraid of giving offence by making
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) reference to scripture too solemn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pish!''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>said the archdeacon, turning away rapidly. <div class="bookquote">``If the ravens
persisted in refusing the food prepared for them, they wouldn't be
fed.''  (<font color='red'><b>A clergyman</b></font>)</div>A clergyman generally dislikes to be met in argument by any
scriptural quotation; he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) feels as affronted as a doctor does, when
recommended by an old woman to take some favourite dose, or as a
lawyer when an unprofessional man attempts to put him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down by a
quibble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall have the living of Crabtree,''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>modestly suggested the warden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eighty pounds a year!''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>sneered the archdeacon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the precentorship,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father-in-law</b></font>)</div>said the father-in-law.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It goes with the wardenship,''  (<font color='red'><b>the son-in-law</b></font>)</div>said the son-in-law. Mr Harding was
prepared to argue this point, and began to do so, but Dr Grantly
stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``My dear warden,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``this is all nonsense.
Eighty pounds or a hundred and sixty makes very little difference.
You can't live on it,--you can't ruin Eleanor's prospects for ever.
In point of fact, you can't resign; the bishop wouldn't accept it;
the whole thing is settled. What I now want to do is to prevent any
inconvenient tittle-tattle,--any more newspaper articles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what I want, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>said the warden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And to prevent that,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued the other, <div class="bookquote">``we mustn't let any talk
of resignation get abroad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I shall resign,''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>said the warden, very, very meekly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens! Susan, my dear, what can I say to him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Grantly</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Grantly, getting up, and putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>) arm through
that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>) father, <div class="bookquote">``what is Eleanor to do if you throw away your
income?''

 (<font color='red'><b>father Eleanor</b></font>)</div><p/>A hot tear stood in each of the warden's eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) looked round upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) married daughter. Why should one sister who was so rich predict
poverty for another? Some such idea as this was on his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) mind, but he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
gave no utterance to it. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) thought of the pelican feeding its
young with blood from its own breast, but he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) gave no utterance to
that either; and then of Eleanor waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) at home, waiting to
congratulate him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) on the end of all his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) trouble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Think of Eleanor, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Grantly</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Grantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you will not do this rash thing?''  (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div>The lady was really moved
beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>) usual calm composure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It can never be rash to do right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I shall certainly
resign this wardenship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, Mr Harding, there is nothing before you but ruin,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>said the
archdeacon, now moved beyond all endurance. <div class="bookquote">``Ruin both for you and
Eleanor. How do you mean to pay the monstrous expenses of this
action?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Grantly</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs Grantly suggested that, as the action was abandoned, the costs
would not be heavy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed they will, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>continued he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``One cannot have the
attorney-general up at twelve o'clock at night for nothing;--but of
course your father has not thought of this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will sell my furniture,''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>said the warden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Furniture!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>ejaculated the other, with a most powerful sneer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, archdeacon,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady, <div class="bookquote">``we needn't mind that at present.
You know you never expected papa to pay the costs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Such absurdity is enough to provoke Job,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>said the archdeacon,
marching quickly up and down the room. <div class="bookquote">``Your father is like a child.
Eight hundred pounds a year!--eight hundred and eighty with the
house,--with nothing to do. The very place for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). And to throw
that up because some scoundrel writes an article in a newspaper!
Well;--I have done my duty. If he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) chooses to ruin his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) child I cannot
help it;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) stood still at the fire-place, and looked at himself
in a dingy mirror which stood on the chimney-piece.

<p/>There was a pause for about a minute, and then the warden, finding
that nothing else was coming, lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) candle, and quietly said,
<div class="bookquote">``Good-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady.

<p/>And so the warden retired; but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) closed the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
heard the well-known ejaculation,--slower, lower, more solemn, more
ponderous than ever,--<div class="bookquote">``Good heavens!''




 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter XIX

<p/>THE WARDEN RESIGNS


<p/>The party met the next morning at breakfast; and a very sombre affair
it was,--very unlike the breakfasts at Plumstead Episcopi.

<p/>There were three thin, small, dry bits of bacon, each an inch long,
served up under a huge old plated cover; there were four three-cornered
bits of dry toast, and four square bits of buttered toast; there was
a loaf of bread, and some oily-looking butter; and on the sideboard
there were the remains of a cold shoulder of mutton. The archdeacon,
however, had not come up from his (<font color='blue'><b>archdeacon</b></font>) rectory to St Paul's Churchyard to
enjoy himself, and therefore nothing was said of the scanty fare.

<p/>The guests were as sorry as the viands;--hardly anything was said over
the breakfast-table. The archdeacon munched his (<font color='blue'><b>archdeacon</b></font>) toast in ominous
silence, turning over bitter thoughts in his (<font color='blue'><b>archdeacon</b></font>) deep mind. The warden
tried to talk to his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) daughter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) tried to answer him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>); but they
both failed. There were no feelings at present in common between
them. The warden was thinking only of getting back to Barchester, and
calculating whether the archdeacon would expect him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) to wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>);
and Mrs Grantly was preparing herself for a grand attack which she (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>) was
to make on her (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>) father, as agreed upon between herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>) husband
during their curtain confabulation of that morning.

<p/>When the waiter had creaked out of the room with the last of the
teacups, the archdeacon got up and went to the window as though to
admire the view. The room looked out on a narrow passage which runs
from St Paul's Churchyard to Paternoster Row; and Dr Grantly patiently
perused the names of the three shopkeepers whose doors were in view.
The warden still kept his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) seat at the table, and examined the pattern
of the tablecloth; and Mrs Grantly, seating herself on the sofa, began
to knit.

<p/>After a while the warden pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) Bradshaw out of his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) pocket, and
began laboriously to consult it. There was a train for Barchester at
10 A.M.. That was out of the question, for it was nearly ten already.
Another at 3 P.M.; another, the night-mail train, at 9 P.M.. The three
o'clock train would take him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) home to tea, and would suit very well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I think I shall go back home at three o'clock
to-day. I shall get home at half-past eight. I don't think there's
anything to keep me in London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The archdeacon and I return by the early train to-morrow, papa; won't
you wait and go back with us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Eleanor will expect me tonight; and I've so much to do; and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much to do!''  (<font color='red'><b>archdeacon</b></font>)</div>said the archdeacon sotto voce; but the warden heard
him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better wait for us, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank ye, my dear! I think I'll go this afternoon.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div>The tamest
animal will turn when driven too hard, and even Mr Harding was
beginning to fight for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) own way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you won't be back before three?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady, addressing
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must leave this at two,''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>said the warden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite out of the question,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>said the archdeacon, answering his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) wife,
and still reading the shopkeepers' names; <div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose I shall be
back till five.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the shopkeepers</b></font>)</div><p/>There was another long pause, during which Mr Harding continued to
study his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) Bradshaw.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go to Cox and Cummins,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>said the archdeacon at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, to Cox and Cummins,''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>said the warden. It was quite a matter of
indifference to him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) where his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) son-in-law went. The names of Cox and
Cummins had now no interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cummins</b></font>) ears. What had he (<font color='blue'><b>Cummins</b></font>) to do with Cox
and Cummins further, having already had his (<font color='blue'><b>Cummins</b></font>) suit finally adjudicated
upon in a court of conscience, a judgment without power of appeal
fully registered, and the matter settled so that all the lawyers in
London could not disturb it. The archdeacon could go to Cox and
Cummins, could remain there all day in anxious discussion; but what
might be said there was no longer matter of interest to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cummins</b></font>), who was
so soon to lay aside the name of warden of Barchester Hospital.

<p/>The archdeacon took up his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) shining new clerical hat, and put on his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
black new clerical gloves, and looked heavy, respectable, decorous,
and opulent, a decided clergyman of the Church of England, every
inch of him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I suppose I shall see you at Barchester the day after
to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>).

<p/>The warden supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) would.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must once more beseech you to take no further steps till you see my
father; if you owe me nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>and the archdeacon looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
thought a great deal were due to him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``at least you owe so much to my
father;''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and, without waiting for a reply, Dr Grantly wended his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) way
to Cox and Cummins.

<p/>Mrs Grantly waited till the last fall of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>) husband's foot was heard,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cummins</b></font>) turned out of the court into St Paul's Churchyard, and then
commenced her (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>) task of talking her (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>) father over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``this is a most serious business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>said the warden, ringing the bell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I greatly feel the distress of mind you must have endured.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you do, my dear;'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) ordered the waiter to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
pen, ink, and paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to write, papa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear;--I am going to write my resignation to the bishop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, pray, papa, put it off till our return;--pray put it off till
you have seen the bishop;--dear papa! for my sake, for Eleanor's!--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is for your sake and Eleanor's that I do this. I hope, at least,
that my children may never have to be ashamed of their father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you talk about shame, papa?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>) stopped while the waiter
creaked in with the paper, and then slowly creaked out again; <div class="bookquote">``how can
you talk about shame? you know what all your friends think about this
question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div><p/>The warden spread his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) paper on the table, placing it on the
meagre blotting-book which the hotel afforded, and sat himself
down to write.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't refuse me one request, papa?''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>continued his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
daughter; <div class="bookquote">``you won't refuse to delay your letter for two short
days? Two days can make no possible difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) naïvely, <div class="bookquote">``if I waited till I got to Barchester, I
might, perhaps, be prevented.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But surely you would not wish to offend the bishop?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God forbid! The bishop is not apt to take offence, and knows me too
well to take in bad part anything that I may be called on to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, papa--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Susan,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``my mind on this subject is made up; it is not
without much repugnance that I act in opposition to the advice of such
men as Sir Abraham Haphazard and the archdeacon; but in this matter
I can take no advice, I cannot alter the resolution to which I have
come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But two days, papa--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--nor can I delay it. You may add to my present unhappiness by
pressing me, but you cannot change my purpose; it will be a comfort
to me if you will let the matter rest'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>: and, dipping his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) pen into the
inkstand, he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) eyes intently on the paper.

<p/>There was something in his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) manner which taught his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) daughter to
perceive that he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) was in earnest; she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had at one time ruled supreme in
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father's house, but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) knew that there were moments when, mild
and meek as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would have his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) way, and the present was an
occasion of the sort. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) returned, therefore, to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) knitting, and
very shortly after left the room.

<p/>The warden was now at liberty to compose his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) letter, and, as it was
characteristic of the man, it shall be given at full length. The
official letter, which, when written, seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) to be too formally
cold to be sent alone to so dear a friend, was accompanied by a
private note; and both are here inserted.

<p/>The letter of resignation ran as follows:--


<p/>CHAPTER HOTEL, ST. PAUL's,
LONDON,
August, 18--

<p/>My LORD BISHOP,


<p/>It is with the greatest pain that I feel myself constrained
to resign into your Lordship's hands the wardenship of the
hospital at Barchester, which you so kindly conferred upon
me, now nearly twelve years since.

<p/>I need not explain the circumstances which have made this
step appear necessary to me. You are aware that a question
has arisen as to the right of the warden to the income which
has been allotted to the wardenship; it has seemed to me
that this right is not well made out, and I hesitate to
incur the risk of taking an income to which my legal claim
appears doubtful.

<p/>The office of precentor of the cathedral is, as your
Lordship is aware, joined to that of the warden; that is to
say, the precentor has for many years been the warden of the
hospital; there is, however, nothing to make the junction of
the two offices necessary, and, unless you or the dean and
chapter object to such an arrangement, I would wish to keep
the precentorship. The income of this office will now be
necessary to me; indeed, I do not know why I should be
ashamed to say that I should have difficulty in supporting
myself without it.

<p/>Your Lordship, and such others as you may please to consult
on the matter, will at once see that my resignation of
the wardenship need offer not the slightest bar to its
occupation by another person. I am thought in the wrong by
all those whom I have consulted in the matter; I have very
little but an inward and an unguided conviction of my own
to bring me to this step, and I shall, indeed, be hurt to
find that any slur is thrown on the preferment which your
kindness bestowed on me, by my resignation of it. I, at
any rate for one, shall look on any successor whom you may
appoint as enjoying a clerical situation of the highest
respectability, and one to which your Lordship's nomination
gives an indefeasible right.

<p/>I cannot finish this official letter without again thanking
your Lordship for all your great kindness, and I beg to
subscribe myself--

<p/>Your Lordship's most obedient servant,

<p/>SEPTIMUS HARDING,

<p/>Warden of Barchester Hospital,
and Precentor of the Cathedral.


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Warden</b></font>) then wrote the following private note:--


<p/>My DEAR BISHOP,

<p/>I cannot send you the accompanying official letter without
a warmer expression of thanks for all your kindness than
would befit a document which may to a certain degree be
made public. You, I know, will understand the feeling,
and, perhaps, pity the weakness which makes me resign
the hospital. I am not made of calibre strong enough to
withstand public attack. Were I convinced that I stood
on ground perfectly firm, that I was certainly justified
in taking eight hundred a year under Hiram's will, I
should feel bound by duty to retain the position, however
unendurable might be the nature of the assault; but, as I
do not feel this conviction, I cannot believe that you will
think me wrong in what I am doing.

<p/>I had at one time an idea of keeping only some moderate
portion of the income; perhaps three hundred a year, and of
remitting the remainder to the trustees; but it occurred to
me, and I think with reason, that by so doing I should place
my successors in an invidious position, and greatly damage
your patronage.

<p/>My dear friend, let me have a line from you to say that
you do not blame me for what I am doing, and that the
officiating vicar of Crabtree Parva will be the same to
you as the warden of the hospital.

<p/>I am very anxious about the precentorship: the archdeacon
thinks it must go with the wardenship; I think not, and,
that, having it, I cannot be ousted. I will, however, be
guided by you and the dean. No other duty will suit me so
well, or come so much within my power of adequate
performance.

<p/>I thank you from my heart for the preferment which I am now
giving up, and for all your kindness, and am, dear bishop,
now as always--

<p/>Yours most sincerely,
SEPTIMUS HARDING

<p/>LONDON,--AUGUST, 18--


<p/>Having written these letters and made a copy of the former one for the
benefit of the archdeacon, Mr Harding, whom we must now cease to call
the warden, he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) having designated himself so for the last time, found
that it was nearly two o'clock, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) must prepare for his (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)
journey. Yes, from this time he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) never again admitted the name by
which he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had been so familiarly known, and in which, to tell the
truth, he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had rejoiced. The love of titles is common to all men,
and a vicar or fellow is as pleased at becoming Mr Archdeacon or
Mr Provost, as a lieutenant at getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) captaincy, or a city
tallow-chandler in becoming Sir John on the occasion of a Queen's
visit to a new bridge. But warden he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) was no longer, and the name of
precentor, though the office was to him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) so dear, confers in itself
no sufficient distinction; our friend, therefore, again became Mr
Harding.

<p/>Mrs Grantly had gone out; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had, therefore, no one to delay him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) by
further entreaties to postpone his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) journey; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had soon arranged his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
bag, and paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) bill, and, leaving a note for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) daughter, in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) put the copy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) official letter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) got into a cab and drove
away to the station with something of triumph in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) heart.

<p/>Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) not cause for triumph? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) not been supremely successful?
Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) not for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) life held his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) own purpose
against that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) son-in-law, and manfully combated against great
odds,--against the archdeacon's wife as well as the archdeacon? Had
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) not gained a great victory, and was it not fit that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) should step
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) cab with triumph?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had not told Eleanor when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) would return, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was on the
look-out for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) by every train by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) could arrive, and the
pony-carriage was at the Barchester station when the train drew up
at the platform.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), sitting beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) steered her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) little
vessel to one side of the road to make room for the clattering omnibus
as they passed from the station into the town, <div class="bookquote">``I hope you'll be able
to feel a proper degree of respect for the vicar of Crabtree.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I am so glad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There was great comfort in returning home to that pleasant house,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was to leave it so soon, and in discussing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) daughter
all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had done, and all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had to do. It must take some
time to get out of one house into another; the curate at Crabtree
could not be abolished under six months, that is, unless other
provision could be made for him (<font color='blue'><b>Crabtree</b></font>); and then the furniture:--the most of
that must be sold to pay Sir Abraham Haphazard for sitting up till
twelve at night. Mr Harding was strangely ignorant as to lawyers'
bills; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had no idea, from twenty pounds to two thousand, as to the
sum in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was indebted for legal assistance. True, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had
called in no lawyer himself; true, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had been no consenting party to
the employment of either Cox and Cummins, or Sir Abraham; he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) had never
been consulted on such matters;--the archdeacon had managed all this
himself, never for a moment suspecting that Mr Harding would take upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) to end the matter in a way of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) own. Had the lawyers' bills
been ten thousand pounds, Mr Harding could not have helped it; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was not on that account disposed to dispute his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) own liability.
The question never occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>); but it did occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
had very little money at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) banker's, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) could receive nothing
further from the hospital, and that the sale of the furniture was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
only resource.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not all, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Harding/ELEANOR</b></font>)</div>said Eleanor pleadingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not quite all, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``that is, if we can help it. We
must have a little at Crabtree,--but it can only be a little; we
must put a bold front on it, Nelly; it isn't easy to come down from
affluence to poverty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And so they planned their future mode of life; the father taking
comfort from the reflection that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter would soon be freed from
it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) resolving that her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father would soon have in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own house
a ready means of escape from the solitude of the Crabtree vicarage.

<p/>When the archdeacon left his (<font color='blue'><b>Crabtree</b></font>) wife and father-in-law at the Chapter
Coffee House to go to Messrs Cox and Cummins, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cummins</b></font>) had no very defined
idea of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Cummins</b></font>) had to do when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cummins</b></font>) got there. Gentlemen when at law,
or in any way engaged in matters requiring legal assistance, are very
apt to go to their lawyers without much absolute necessity;--gentlemen
when doing so, are apt to describe such attendance as quite
compulsory, and very disagreeable. The lawyers, on the other hand,
do not at all see the necessity, though they quite agree as to the
disagreeable nature of the visit;--gentlemen when so engaged are
usually somewhat gravelled at finding nothing to say to their learned
friends; they generally talk a little politics, a little weather, ask
some few foolish questions about their suit, and then withdraw, having
passed half an hour in a small dingy waiting-room, in company with
some junior assistant-clerk, and ten minutes with the members of the
firm; the business is then over for which the gentleman has come up
to London, probably a distance of a hundred and fifty miles. To be
sure he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) goes to the play, and dines at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) friend's club, and has a
bachelor's liberty and bachelor's recreation for three or four days;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could not probably plead the desire of such gratifications as
a reason to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wife for a trip to London.

<p/>Married ladies, when your husbands find they are positively obliged to
attend their legal advisers, the nature of the duty to be performed is
generally of this description.

<p/>The archdeacon would not have dreamt of leaving London without going
to Cox and Cummins; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Cummins</b></font>) had nothing to say to them. The game
was up; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cummins</b></font>) plainly saw that Mr Harding in this matter was not to be
moved; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) only remaining business on this head was to pay the bill
and have done with it; and I think it may be taken for granted,
that whatever the cause may be that takes a gentleman to a lawyer's
chambers, he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) never goes there to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) bill.

<p/>Dr Grantly, however, in the eyes of Messrs Cox and Cummins,
represented the spiritualities of the diocese of Barchester, as Mr
Chadwick did the temporalities, and was, therefore, too great a man to
undergo the half-hour in the clerk's room. It will not be necessary
that we should listen to the notes of sorrow in which the archdeacon
bewailed to Mr Cox the weakness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cox</b></font>) father-in-law, and the end
of all their hopes of triumph; nor need we repeat the various
exclamations of surprise with which the mournful intelligence was
received. No tragedy occurred, though Mr Cox, a short and somewhat
bull-necked man, was very near a fit of apoplexy when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cox</b></font>) first
attempted to ejaculate that fatal word--resign!

<p/>Over and over again did Mr Cox attempt to enforce on the archdeacon
the propriety of urging on Mr Warden the madness of the deed he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) was
about to do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eight hundred a year!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Cox</b></font>)</div>said Mr Cox.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And nothing whatever to do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cummins/Mr Cummins</b></font>)</div>said Mr Cummins, who had joined the
conference.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No private fortune, I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Cox</b></font>)</div>said Mr Cox.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a shilling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cummins/Mr Cummins</b></font>)</div>said Mr Cummins, in a very low voice, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Cummins</b></font>)
head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never heard of such a case in all my experience,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Cox</b></font>)</div>said Mr Cox.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eight hundred a year, and as nice a house as any gentleman could wish
to hang up his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hat in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cummins/Mr Cummins</b></font>)</div>said Mr Cummins.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And an unmarried daughter, I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Cox</b></font>)</div>said Mr Cox, with much moral
seriousness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cox</b></font>) tone. The archdeacon only sighed as each separate
wail was uttered, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Cox</b></font>) head, signifying that the fatuity of
some people was past belief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cummins/Mr Cummins</b></font>)</div>said Mr Cummins, brightening up.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you how you might save it:--let him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) exchange.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exchange where?''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>said the archdeacon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exchange for a living. There's Quiverful, of Puddingdale;--he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has
twelve children, and would be delighted to get the hospital. To
be sure Puddingdale is only four hundred, but that would be saving
something out of the fire: Mr Harding would have a curate, and still
keep three hundred or three hundred and fifty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The archdeacon</b></font>)</div><p/>The archdeacon opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Cummins</b></font>) ears and listened; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cummins</b></font>) really thought the
scheme might do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The newspapers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cummins/Mr Cummins</b></font>)</div>continued Mr Cummins, <div class="bookquote">``might hammer away at
Quiverful every day for the next six months without his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) minding
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cummins/Mr Cummins</b></font>)</div><p/>The archdeacon took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Cummins</b></font>) hat, and returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cummins</b></font>) hotel, thinking
the matter over deeply. At any rate he (<font color='blue'><b>Cummins</b></font>) would sound Quiverful. A man
with twelve children would do much to double his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) income.




<p/>Chapter XX

<p/>FAREWELL


<p/>On the morning after Mr Harding's return home he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) received a note from
the bishop full of affection, condolence, and praise. <div class="bookquote">``Pray come to
me at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bishop</b></font>)</div>wrote the bishop, <div class="bookquote">``that we may see what had better be
done; as to the hospital, I will not say a word to dissuade you; but I
don't like your going to Crabtree: at any rate, come to me at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the bishop</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Harding did go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) at once; and long and confidential was the
consultation between the two old friends. There they sat together
the whole long day, plotting to get the better of the archdeacon, and
to carry out little schemes of their own, which they knew would be
opposed by the whole weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) authority.

<p/>The bishop's first idea was, that Mr Harding, if left to himself,
would certainly starve,--not in the figurative sense in which so many
of our ladies and gentlemen do starve on incomes from one to five
hundred a year; not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) would be starved as regarded dress coats,
port wine, and pocket-money; but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) would positively perish of
inanition for want of bread.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is a man to live, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gives up all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) income?''  (<font color='red'><b>the bishop</b></font>)</div>said the
bishop to himself. And then the good-natured little man began to
consider how his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend might be best rescued from a death so horrid
and painful.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first proposition to Mr Harding was, that they should live
together at the palace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), the bishop, positively assured Mr Harding
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) wanted another resident chaplain,--not a young working
chaplain, but a steady, middle-aged chaplain; one who would dine and
drink a glass of wine with him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>), talk about the archdeacon, and poke
the fire. The bishop did not positively name all these duties, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) gave Mr Harding to understand that such would be the nature of the
service required.

<p/>It was not without much difficulty that Mr Harding made his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) friend see
that this would not suit him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>); that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) could not throw up the bishop's
preferment, and then come and hang on at the bishop's table; that he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
could not allow people to say of him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) that it was an easy matter to
abandon his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) own income, as he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was able to sponge on that of another
person. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) succeeded, however, in explaining that the plan would not
do, and then the bishop brought forward another which he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
sleeve. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>), the bishop, had in his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) will left certain moneys to Mr
Harding's two daughters, imagining that Mr Harding would himself want
no such assistance during his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) own lifetime. This legacy amounted to
three thousand pounds each, duty free; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) now pressed it as a gift
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The girls, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``will have it just the same when
you're gone,--and they won't want it sooner;--and as for the interest
during my lifetime, it isn't worth talking about. I have more than
enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With much difficulty and heartfelt sorrow, Mr Harding refused also
this offer. No; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) wish was to support himself, however poorly,--not
to be supported on the charity of anyone. It was hard to make the
bishop understand this; it was hard to make him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) comprehend that
the only real favour he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) could confer was the continuation of his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
independent friendship; but at last even this was done. At any rate,
thought the bishop, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) will come and dine with me from time to time,
and if he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) be absolutely starving I shall see it.

<p/>Touching the precentorship, the bishop was clearly of opinion that it
could be held without the other situation,--an opinion from which no
one differed; and it was therefore soon settled among all the parties
concerned, that Mr Harding should still be the precentor of the
cathedral.

<p/>On the day following Mr Harding's return, the archdeacon reached
Plumstead full of Mr Cummins's scheme regarding Puddingdale and Mr
Quiverful. On the very next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Quiverful</b></font>) drove over to Puddingdale,
and obtained the full consent of the wretched clerical Priam, who was
endeavouring to feed his (<font color='blue'><b>Quiverful</b></font>) poor Hecuba and a dozen of Hectors on the
small proceeds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quiverful</b></font>) ecclesiastical kingdom. Mr Quiverful had no
doubts as to the legal rights of the warden; his (<font color='blue'><b>Quiverful</b></font>) conscience would be
quite clear as to accepting the income; and as to _The Jupiter_, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quiverful</b></font>)
begged to assure the archdeacon that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quiverful</b></font>) was quite indifferent to any
emanations from the profane portion of the periodical press.

<p/>Having so far succeeded, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quiverful</b></font>) next sounded the bishop; but here he (<font color='blue'><b>Quiverful</b></font>) was
astonished by most unexpected resistance. The bishop did not think
it would do. <div class="bookquote">``Not do, why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>and seeing that his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) father was not
shaken, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) repeated the question in a severer form: <div class="bookquote">``Why not do, my
lord?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) lordship looked very unhappy, and shuffled about in his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) chair,
but still didn't give way; he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) thought Puddingdale wouldn't do for Mr
Harding; it was too far from Barchester.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! of course he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)'ll have a curate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The bishop</b></font>)</div><p/>The bishop also thought that Mr Quiverful wouldn't do for the
hospital; such an exchange wouldn't look well at such a time; and,
when pressed harder, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) declared he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) didn't think Mr Harding would
accept of Puddingdale under any circumstances.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) to live?''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>demanded the archdeacon.

<p/>The bishop, with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) eyes, declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) had not the
slightest conception how life was to be sustained within him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) at all.

<p/>The archdeacon then left his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) father, and went down to the hospital;
but Mr Harding wouldn't listen at all to the Puddingdale scheme. To
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) eyes it had no attraction; it savoured of simony, and was likely
to bring down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) harder and more deserved strictures than any he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
had yet received: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) positively declined to become vicar of
Puddingdale under any circumstances.

<p/>The archdeacon waxed wroth, talked big, and looked bigger; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) said
something about dependence and beggary, spoke of the duty every man
was under to earn his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bread, made passing allusions to the follies of
youth and waywardness of age, as though Mr Harding were afflicted by
both, and ended by declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had done. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had
left no stone unturned to arrange matters on the best and easiest
footing; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had, in fact, so arranged them, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had so
managed that there was no further need of any anxiety in the matter.
And how had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) been paid? His (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) advice had been systematically
rejected; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had been not only slighted, but distrusted and avoided;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) measures had been utterly thrown over, as had been Sir
Abraham, who, he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) had reason to know, was much pained at what had
occurred. He (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) now found it was useless to interfere any further, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) should retire. If any further assistance were required from him (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>),
he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) would probably be called on, and should be again happy to come
forward. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) left the hospital, and has not since entered it
from that day to this.

<p/>And here we must take leave of Archdeacon Grantly. We fear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) is
represented in these pages as being worse than he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) is; but we have had
to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) foibles, and not with his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) virtues. We have seen only
the weak side of the man, and have lacked the opportunity of bringing
him (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) forward on his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) strong ground. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) is a man somewhat too fond
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) own way, and not sufficiently scrupulous in his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) manner of
achieving it, his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) best friends cannot deny. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) is bigoted in
favour, not so much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) doctrines as of his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) cloth, is also true:
and it is true that the possession of a large income is a desire that
sits near his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) heart. Nevertheless, the archdeacon is a gentleman and
a man of conscience; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spends his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money liberally, and does the work
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has to do with the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ability; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) improves the tone of
society of those among whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lives. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) aspirations are of a
healthy, if not of the highest, kind. Though never an austere man,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) upholds propriety of conduct both by example and precept. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
is generous to the poor, and hospitable to the rich; in matters of
religion he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is sincere, and yet no Pharisee; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is in earnest, and yet
no fanatic. On the whole, the Archdeacon of Barchester is a man doing
more good than harm,--a man to be furthered and supported, though
perhaps also to be controlled; and it is matter of regret to us that
the course of our narrative has required that we should see more of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) weakness than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strength.

<p/>Mr Harding allowed himself no rest till everything was prepared for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) departure from the hospital. It may be as well to mention that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
was not driven to the stern necessity of selling all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) furniture: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
had been quite in earnest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) intention to do so, but it was soon
made known to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) that the claims of Messrs Cox and Cummins made no
such step obligatory. The archdeacon had thought it wise to make use
of the threat of the lawyer's bill, to frighten his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) father-in-law into
compliance; but he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had no intention to saddle Mr Harding with costs,
which had been incurred by no means exclusively for his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) benefit.
The amount of the bill was added to the diocesan account, and was,
in fact, paid out of the bishop's pocket, without any consciousness
on the part of his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) lordship. A great part of his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) furniture he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) did
resolve to sell, having no other means to dispose of it; and the
ponies and carriage were transferred, by private contract, to the use
of an old maiden lady in the city.

<p/>For his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) present use Mr Harding took a lodging in Barchester, and
thither were conveyed such articles as he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) wanted for daily use:--his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
music, books, and instruments, his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) own arm-chair, and Eleanor's pet
sofa; her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) teapoy and his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) cellaret, and also the slender but still
sufficient contents of his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) wine-cellar. Mrs Grantly had much wished
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>) sister would reside at Plumstead, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>) father's house
at Crabtree should be ready for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>); but Eleanor herself strongly
resisted this proposal. It was in vain urged upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Grantly</b></font>), that a lady
in lodgings cost more than a gentleman; and that, under her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father's
present circumstances, such an expense should be avoided. Eleanor had
not pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) father to give up the hospital in order that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) might
live at Plumstead Rectory and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) Barchester lodgings;
nor did Eleanor think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) would be treating a certain gentleman
very fairly, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) betook herself to the house which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would be the
least desirous of entering of any in the county. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) got a little
bedroom for herself behind the sitting-room, and just over the little
back parlour of the chemist, with whom they were to lodge. There was
somewhat of a savour of senna softened by peppermint about the place;
but, on the whole, the lodgings were clean and comfortable.

<p/>The day had been fixed for the migration of the ex-warden, and all
Barchester were in a state of excitement on the subject. Opinion
was much divided as to the propriety of Mr Harding's conduct. The
mercantile part of the community, the mayor and corporation, and
council, also most of the ladies, were loud in his (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) praise. Nothing
could be more noble, nothing more generous, nothing more upright.
But the gentry were of a different way of thinking,--especially the
lawyers and the clergymen. They said such conduct was very weak and
undignified; that Mr Harding evinced a lamentable want of _esprit de
corps_, as well as courage; and that such an abdication must do much
harm, and could do but little good.

<p/>On the evening before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) left, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) summoned all the bedesmen into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
parlour to wish them good-bye. With Bunce he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) had been in frequent
communication since his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) return from London, and had been at much
pains to explain to the old man the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resignation, without
in any way prejudicing the position of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) successor. The others,
also, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen more or less frequently; and had heard from most of
them separately some expression of regret at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) departure; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
postponed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) farewell till the last evening.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now bade the maid put wine and glasses on the table; and had the
chairs arranged around the room; and sent Bunce to each of the men to
request they would come and say farewell to their late warden. Soon
the noise of aged scuffling feet was heard upon the gravel and in the
little hall, and the eleven men who were enabled to leave their rooms
were assembled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in, my friends, come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>said the warden;--he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) was still warden
then. <div class="bookquote">``Come in, and sit down;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) took the hand of Abel Handy,
who was the nearest to him (<font color='blue'><b>Handy</b></font>), and led the limping grumbler to a chair.
The others followed slowly and bashfully; the infirm, the lame, and
the blind: poor wretches! who had been so happy, had they but known
it! Now their aged faces were covered with shame, and every kind word
from their master was a coal of fire burning on their heads.

<p/>When first the news had reached them that Mr Harding was going to
leave the hospital, it had been received with a kind of triumph;--his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
departure was, as it were, a prelude to success. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had admitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
want of right to the money about which they were disputing; and as it
did not belong to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), of course, it did to them. The one hundred a
year to each of them was actually becoming a reality; and Abel Handy
was a hero, and Bunce a faint-hearted sycophant, worthy neither honour
nor fellowship. But other tidings soon made their way into the old
men's rooms. It was first notified to them that the income abandoned
by Mr Harding would not come to them; and these accounts were
confirmed by attorney Finney. They were then informed that Mr
Harding's place would be at once filled by another. That the new
warden could not be a kinder man they all knew; that he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) would be a
less friendly one most suspected; and then came the bitter information
that, from the moment of Mr Harding's departure, the twopence a day,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) own peculiar gift, must of necessity be withdrawn.

<p/>And this was to be the end of all their mighty struggle,--of their
fight for their rights,--of their petition, and their debates, and
their hopes! They were to change the best of masters for a possible
bad one, and to lose twopence a day each man! No; unfortunate as this
was, it was not the worst, or nearly the worst, as will just now be
seen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down, sit down, my friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>said the warden; <div class="bookquote">``I want to say a
word to you and to drink your healths, before I leave you. Come up
here, Moody, here is a chair for you; come, Jonathan Crumple;'' (<font color='red'><b>the warden</b></font>)</div>--and by
degrees he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) got the men to be seated. It was not surprising that they
should hang back with faint hearts, having returned so much kindness
with such deep ingratitude. Last of all of them came Bunce, and with
sorrowful mien and slow step got into his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) accustomed seat near the
fire-place.

<p/>When they were all in their places, Mr Harding rose to address them;
and then finding himself not quite at home on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) legs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) sat down
again. <div class="bookquote">``My dear old friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you all know that I am going
to leave you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a sort of murmur ran round the room, intended, perhaps, to
express regret at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) departure; but it was but a murmur, and might
have meant that or anything else.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There has been lately some misunderstanding between us. You have
thought, I believe, that you did not get all that you were entitled
to, and that the funds of the hospital have not been properly disposed
of. As for me, I cannot say what should be the disposition of these
moneys, or how they should be managed, and I have therefore thought it
best to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We never wanted to drive your reverence out of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Handy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, your reverence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Skulpit/Job Skulpit</b></font>)</div>said Skulpit. <div class="bookquote">``We never thought it
would come to this. When I signed the petition,--that is, I didn't
sign it, because--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) reverence speak, can't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Moody</b></font>)</div>said Moody.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div>continued Mr Harding; <div class="bookquote">``I am sure you did not wish to turn me
out; but I thought it best to leave you. I am not a very good hand at
a lawsuit, as you may all guess; and when it seemed necessary that our
ordinary quiet mode of living should be disturbed, I thought it better
to go. I am neither angry nor offended with any man in the hospital.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Bunce uttered a kind of groan, very clearly expressive of
disagreement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am neither angry nor displeased with any man in the hospital,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr Harding, emphatically. <div class="bookquote">``If any man has been wrong,--and
I don't say any man has,--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has erred through wrong advice. In this
country all are entitled to look for their own rights, and you have
done no more. As long as your interests and my interests were at
variance, I could give you no counsel on this subject; but the
connection between us has ceased; my income can no longer depend on
your doings, and therefore, as I leave you, I venture to offer to you
my advice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div><p/>The men all declared that they would from henceforth be entirely
guided by Mr Harding's opinion in their affairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some gentleman will probably take my place here very soon, and I
strongly advise you to be prepared to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) in a kindly spirit
and to raise no further question among yourselves as to the amount of
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) income. Were you to succeed in lessening what he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has to receive,
you would not increase your own allowance. The surplus would not go
to you; your wants are adequately provided for, and your position
could hardly be improved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless your reverence, we knows it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Spriggs</b></font>)</div>said Spriggs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all true, your reverence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Skulpit/Job Skulpit</b></font>)</div>said Skulpit. <div class="bookquote">``We sees it all now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr Harding,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bunce/Mr Bunce</b></font>)</div>said Bunce, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) mouth for the first time;
<div class="bookquote">``I believe they do understand it now, now that they've driven from
under the same roof with them such a master as not one of them will
ever know again,--now that they're like to be in sore want of a
friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bunce/Mr Bunce</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, Bunce,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div>said Mr Harding, blowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) nose and manoeuvring
to wipe his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) eyes at the same time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, as to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Handy, <div class="bookquote">``we none of us never wanted to do Mr
Harding no harm; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)'s going now, it's not along of us; and I don't
see for what Mr Bunce speaks up agen us that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've ruined yourselves, and you've ruined me too, and that's why,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bunce/Mr Bunce</b></font>)</div>said Bunce.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Bunce,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div>said Mr Harding; <div class="bookquote">``there's nobody ruined at all.
I hope you'll let me leave you all friends; I hope you'll all drink
a glass of wine in friendly feeling with me and with one another.
You'll have a good friend, I don't doubt, in your new warden; and if
ever you want any other, why after all I'm not going so far off but
that I shall sometimes see you;''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div>and then, having finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) speech,
Mr Harding filled all the glasses, and himself handed each a glass to
the men round him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), and raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) own said:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you all! you have my heartfelt wishes for your welfare.
I hope you may live contented, and die trusting in the Lord Jesus
Christ, and thankful to Almighty God for the good things he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has given
you. God bless you, my friends!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and Mr Harding drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) wine.

<p/>Another murmur, somewhat more articulate than the first, passed round
the circle, and this time it was intended to imply a blessing on Mr
Harding. It had, however, but little cordiality in it. Poor old
men! how could they be cordial with their sore consciences and shamed
faces? how could they bid God bless him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) with hearty voices and a true
benison, knowing, as they did, that their vile cabal had driven him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
from his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) happy home, and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) old age to seek shelter under
a strange roof-tree? They did their best, however; they drank their
wine, and withdrew.

<p/>As they left the hall-door, Mr Harding shook hands with each of the
men, and spoke a kind word to them about their individual cases and
ailments; and so they departed, answering his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) questions in the fewest
words, and retreated to their dens, a sorrowful repentant crew.

<p/>All but Bunce, who still remained to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) own farewell. <div class="bookquote">``There's
poor old Bell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div>said Mr Harding; <div class="bookquote">``I mustn't go without saying a word
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>); come through with me, Bunce, and bring the wine with you;''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div>and so they went through to the men's cottages, and found the old man
propped up as usual in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've come to say good-bye to you, Bell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div>said Mr Harding, speaking
loud, for the old man was deaf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And are you going away, then, really?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bell/Johnny Bell</b></font>)</div>asked Bell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I am, and I've brought you a glass of wine; so that we may
part friends, as we lived, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man took the proffered glass in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shaking hands, and drank
it eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``God bless you, Bell!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div>said Mr Harding; <div class="bookquote">``good-bye, my old
friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so you're really going?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man again asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I am, Bell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The creature</b></font>)</div><p/>The poor old bed-ridden creature still kept Mr Harding's hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
own, and the warden thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had met with something like warmth
of feeling in the one of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) subjects from whom it was the least
likely to be expected; for poor old Bell had nearly outlived all human
feelings. <div class="bookquote">``And your reverence,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) paused, while
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) old palsied head shook horribly, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) shrivelled cheeks sank
lower within his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) jaws, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) glazy eye gleamed with a momentary
light; <div class="bookquote">``and your reverence, shall we get the hundred a year, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>How gently did Mr Harding try to extinguish the false hope of money
which had been so wretchedly raised to disturb the quiet of the dying
man! One other week and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mortal coil would be shuffled off; in
one short week would God resume his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul, and set it apart for its
irrevocable doom; seven more tedious days and nights of senseless
inactivity, and all would be over for poor Bell in this world; and
yet, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) last audible words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) was demanding his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) moneyed rights,
and asserting himself to be the proper heir of John Hiram's bounty!
Not on him (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>), poor sinner as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) was, be the load of such sin!

<p/>Mr Harding returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) parlour, meditating with a sick heart
on what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had seen, and Bunce with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>). We will not describe the
parting of these two good men, for good men they were. It was in
vain that the late warden endeavoured to comfort the heart of the old
bedesman; poor old Bunce felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) days of comfort were gone. The
hospital had to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) been a happy home, but it could be so no longer.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) had had honour there, and friendship; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) had recognised his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) master,
and been recognised; all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) wants, both of soul and body, had been
supplied, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) had been a happy man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) wept grievously as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>)
parted from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) friend, and the tears of an old man are bitter.
<div class="bookquote">``It is all over for me in this world,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave the last
squeeze to Mr Harding's hand; <div class="bookquote">``I have now to forgive those who have
injured me;--and to die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Harding/Harding</b></font>)</div><p/>And so the old man went out, and then Mr Harding gave way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) grief
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) too wept aloud.




<p/>Chapter XXI

<p/>CONCLUSION

<p/>Our tale is now done, and it only remains to us to collect the
scattered threads of our little story, and to tie them into a seemly
knot. This will not be a work of labour, either to the author or
to his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) readers; we have not to deal with many personages, or with
stirring events, and were it not for the custom of the thing, we might
leave it to the imagination of all concerned to conceive how affairs
at Barchester arranged themselves.

<p/>On the morning after the day last alluded to, Mr Harding, at an early
hour, walked out of the hospital, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) daughter under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) arm, and
sat down quietly to breakfast at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) lodgings over the chemist's shop.
There was no parade about his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) departure; no one, not even Bunce, was
there to witness it; had he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) walked to the apothecary's thus early to
get a piece of court plaster, or a box of lozenges, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) could not have
done it with less appearance of an important movement. There was a
tear in Eleanor's eye as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) passed through the big gateway and over
the bridge; but Mr Harding walked with an elastic step, and entered
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) new abode with a pleasant face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you have everything ready, and you can
make tea here just as nicely as in the parlour at the hospital.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So
Eleanor took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) bonnet and made the tea. After this manner did
the late Warden of Barchester Hospital accomplish his (<font color='blue'><b>Warden</b></font>) flitting, and
change his (<font color='blue'><b>Warden</b></font>) residence.

<p/>It was not long before the archdeacon brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Warden</b></font>) father to discuss
the subject of a new warden. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Warden</b></font>) looked upon the nomination
as his (<font color='blue'><b>Warden</b></font>) own, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Warden</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warden</b></font>) eye three or four fitting candidates,
seeing that Mr Cummins's plan as to the living of Puddingdale could
not be brought to bear. How can I describe the astonishment which
confounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Cummins</b></font>), when his (<font color='blue'><b>Cummins</b></font>) father declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cummins</b></font>) would appoint no
successor to Mr Harding? <div class="bookquote">``If we can get the matter set to rights, Mr
Harding will return,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bishop</b></font>)</div>said the bishop; <div class="bookquote">``and if we cannot, it will be
wrong to put any other gentleman into so cruel a position.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the bishop</b></font>)</div><p/>It was in vain that the archdeacon argued and lectured, and even
threatened; in vain he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) my-lorded his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) poor father in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) sternest
manner; in vain his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``good heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>were ejaculated in a tone that
might have moved a whole synod, let alone one weak and aged bishop.
Nothing could induce his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) father to fill up the vacancy caused by Mr
Harding's retirement.

<p/>Even John Bold would have pitied the feelings with which the
archdeacon returned to Plumstead: the church was falling, nay, already
in ruins; its dignitaries were yielding without a struggle before the
blows of its antagonists; and one of its most respected bishops, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
own father,--the man considered by all the world as being in such
matters under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), Dr Grantly's, control,--had positively resolved to
capitulate, and own himself vanquished!

<p/>And how fared the hospital under this resolve of its visitor? Badly
indeed. It is now some years since Mr Harding left it, and the
warden's house is still tenantless. Old Bell has died, and Billy
Gazy; the one-eyed Spriggs has drunk himself to death, and three
others of the twelve have been gathered into the churchyard mould.
Six have gone, and the six vacancies remain unfilled! Yes, six have
died, with no kind friend to solace their last moments, with no
wealthy neighbour to administer comforts and ease the stings of death.
Mr Harding, indeed, did not desert them; from him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) they had such
consolation as a dying man may receive from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Christian pastor; but
it was the occasional kindness of a stranger which ministered to them,
and not the constant presence of a master, a neighbour, and a friend.

<p/>Nor were those who remained better off than those who died.
Dissensions rose among them, and contests for pre-eminence; and
then they began to understand that soon one among them would be the
last,--some one wretched being would be alone there in that now
comfortless hospital,--the miserable relic of what had once been so
good and so comfortable.

<p/>The building of the hospital itself has not been allowed to go to
ruins. Mr Chadwick, who still holds his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadwick</b></font>) stewardship, and pays the
accruing rents into an account opened at a bank for the purpose, sees
to that; but the whole place has become disordered and ugly. The
warden's garden is a wretched wilderness, the drive and paths are
covered with weeds, the flower-beds are bare, and the unshorn lawn is
now a mass of long damp grass and unwholesome moss. The beauty of the
place is gone; its attractions have withered. Alas! a very few years
since it was the prettiest spot in Barchester, and now it is a
disgrace to the city.

<p/>Mr Harding did not go out to Crabtree Parva. An arrangement was made
which respected the homestead of Mr Smith and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) happy family, and
put Mr Harding into possession of a small living within the walls of
the city. It is the smallest possible parish, containing a part of
the Cathedral Close and a few old houses adjoining. The church is a
singular little Gothic building, perched over a gateway, through which
the Close is entered, and is approached by a flight of stone steps
which leads down under the archway of the gate. It is no bigger
than an ordinary room,--perhaps twenty-seven feet long by eighteen
wide,--but still it is a perfect church. It contains an old carved
pulpit and reading-desk, a tiny altar under a window filled with dark
old-coloured glass, a font, some half-dozen pews, and perhaps a dozen
seats for the poor; and also a vestry. The roof is high pitched, and
of black old oak, and the three large beams which support it run down
to the side walls, and terminate in grotesquely carved faces,--two
devils and an angel on one side, two angels and a devil on the other.
Such is the church of St Cuthbert at Barchester, of which Mr Harding
became rector, with a clear income of seventy-five pounds a year.

<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) performs afternoon service every Sunday, and administers the
Sacrament once in every three months. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) audience is not large; and,
had they been so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) could not have accommodated them: but enough come
to fill his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) six pews, and on the front seat of those devoted to the
poor is always to be seen our old friend Mr Bunce, decently arrayed in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunce</b></font>) bedesman's gown.

<p/>Mr Harding is still precentor of Barchester; and it is very rarely
the case that those who attend the Sunday morning service miss the
gratification of hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) chant the Litany, as no other man in
England can do it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is neither a discontented nor an unhappy
man; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still inhabits the lodgings to which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on leaving the
hospital, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now has them to himself. Three months after that
time Eleanor became Mrs Bold, and of course removed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) husband's
house.

<p/>There were some difficulties to be got over on the occasion of the
marriage. The archdeacon, who could not so soon overcome his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) grief,
would not be persuaded to grace the ceremony with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) presence, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife and children to be there. The marriage took place
in the cathedral, and the bishop himself officiated. It was the last
occasion on which he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) ever did so; and, though he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) still lives, it is
not probable that he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) will ever do so again.

<p/>Not long after the marriage, perhaps six months, when Eleanor's
bridal-honours were fading, and persons were beginning to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) Mrs
Bold without twittering, the archdeacon consented to meet John Bold at
a dinner-party, and since that time they have become almost friends.
The archdeacon firmly believes that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) brother-in-law was, as a
bachelor, an infidel, an unbeliever in the great truths of our
religion; but that matrimony has opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) eyes, as it has those of
others. And Bold is equally inclined to think that time has softened
the asperities of the archdeacon's character. Friends though they
are, they do not often revert to the feud of the hospital.

<p/>Mr Harding, we say, is not an unhappy man: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) keeps his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) lodgings, but
they are of little use to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), except as being the one spot on earth
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) calls his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) own. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) time is spent chiefly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) daughter's
or at the palace; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) is never left alone, even should he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) wish to be
so; and within a twelvemonth of Eleanor's marriage his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) determination
to live at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) own lodging had been so far broken through and
abandoned, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) consented to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) violoncello permanently
removed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) daughter's house.

<p/>Every other day a message is brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) from the bishop. <div class="bookquote">``The
bishop's compliments, and his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) lordship is not very well to-day, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) hopes Mr Harding will dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>This bulletin as to the old
man's health is a myth; for though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is over eighty he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is never ill,
and will probably die some day, as a spark goes out, gradually and
without a struggle. Mr Harding does dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) very often, which
means going to the palace at three and remaining till ten; and
whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) does not the bishop whines, and says that the port wine is
corked, and complains that nobody attends to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>), and frets himself
off to bed an hour before his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) time.

<p/>It was long before the people of Barchester forgot to call Mr Harding
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) long well-known name of Warden. It had become so customary to
say Mr Warden, that it was not easily dropped. <div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Warden</b></font>) always
says when so addressed, <div class="bookquote">``not warden now, only precentor.''

<div class="bookquote">``Defects,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

<p/>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

<p/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<p/>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
-LRB-$1 to $5,000-RRB- are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

<p/>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

<p/>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

<p/>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<p/>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations. To donate, please visit:

<p/>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

<p/>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hart</b></font>) produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

<p/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<p/>http://www.gutenberg.net

<p/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
