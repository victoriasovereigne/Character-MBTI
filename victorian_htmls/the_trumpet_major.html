<p/>PREFACE


<p/>The present tale is founded more largely on testimony--oral and
written--than any other in this series. The external incidents which
direct its course are mostly an unexaggerated reproduction of the
recollections of old persons well known to the author in childhood, but
now long dead, who were eye-witnesses of those scenes. If wholly
transcribed their recollections would have filled a volume thrice the
length of <div class="bookquote">``The Trumpet-Major.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Buonaparte</b></font>)</div><p/>Down to the middle of this century, and later, there were not wanting, in
the neighbourhood of the places more or less clearly indicated herein,
casual relics of the circumstances amid which the action moves--our
preparations for defence against the threatened invasion of England by
Buonaparte. An outhouse door riddled with bullet-holes, which had been
extemporized by a solitary man as a target for firelock practice when the
landing was hourly expected, a heap of bricks and clods on a beacon-hill,
which had formed the chimney and walls of the hut occupied by the beacon-
keeper, worm-eaten shafts and iron heads of pikes for the use of those
who had no better weapons, ridges on the down thrown up during the
encampment, fragments of volunteer uniform, and other such lingering
remains, brought to my imagination in early childhood the state of
affairs at the date of the war more vividly than volumes of history could
have done.

<p/>Those who have attempted to construct a coherent narrative of past times
from the fragmentary information furnished by survivors, are aware of the
difficulty of ascertaining the true sequence of events indiscriminately
recalled. For this purpose the newspapers of the date were
indispensable. Of other documents consulted I may mention, for the
satisfaction of those who love a true story, that the ``Address to all
Ranks and Descriptions of Englishmen' was transcribed from an original
copy in a local museum; that the hieroglyphic portrait of Napoleon
existed as a print down to the present day in an old woman's cottage near
``Overcombe;' that the particulars of the King's doings at his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) favourite
watering-place were augmented by details from records of the time. The
drilling scene of the local militia received some additions from an
account given in so grave a work as Gifford's ``History of the Wars of the
French Revolution' -LRB-London, 1817-RRB-. But on reference to the History I
find I was mistaken in supposing the account to be advanced as authentic,
or to refer to rural England. However, it does in a large degree accord
with the local traditions of such scenes that I have heard recounted,
times without number, and the system of drill was tested by reference to
the Army Regulations of 1801, and other military handbooks. Almost the
whole narrative of the supposed landing of the French in the Bay is from
oral relation as aforesaid. Other proofs of the veracity of this
chronicle have escaped my recollection.

<p/>I. WHAT WAS SEEN FROM THE WINDOW OVERLOOKING THE DOWN


<p/>In the days of high-waisted and muslin-gowned women, when the vast amount
of soldiering going on in the country was a cause of much trembling to
the sex, there lived in a village near the Wessex coast two ladies of
good report, though unfortunately of limited means. The elder was a Mrs.
Martha Garland, a landscape-painter's widow, and the other was her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) only
daughter Anne.

<p/>Anne was fair, very fair, in a poetical sense; but in complexion she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was
of that particular tint between blonde and brunette which is
inconveniently left without a name. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes were honest and inquiring,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mouth cleanly cut and yet not classical, the middle point of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
upper lip scarcely descending so far as it should have done by rights, so
that at the merest pleasant thought, not to mention a smile, portions of
two or three white teeth were uncovered whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would or not. Some
people said that this was very attractive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was graceful and slender,
and, though but little above five feet in height, could draw herself up
to look tall. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) manner, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) comings and goings, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``I'll do
this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``I'll do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) combined dignity with sweetness as no other
girl could do; and any impressionable stranger youths who passed by were
led to yearn for a windfall of speech from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and to see at the same
time that they would not get it. In short, beneath all that was charming
and simple in this young woman there lurked a real firmness, unperceived
at first, as the speck of colour lurks unperceived in the heart of the
palest parsley flower.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wore a white handkerchief to cover her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) white neck, and a cap on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
head with a pink ribbon round it, tied in a bow at the front. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had a
great variety of these cap-ribbons, the young men being fond of sending
them to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as presents until they fell definitely in love with a special
sweetheart elsewhere, when they left off doing so. Between the border of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cap and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) forehead were ranged a row of round brown curls, like
swallows' nests under eaves.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lived with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) widowed mother in a portion of an ancient building
formerly a manor-house, but now a mill, which, being too large for his (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>)
own requirements, the miller had found it convenient to divide and
appropriate in part to these highly respectable tenants. In this
dwelling Mrs. Garland's and Anne's ears were soothed morning, noon, and
night by the music of the mill, the wheels and cogs of which, being of
wood, produced notes that might have borne in their minds a remote
resemblance to the wooden tones of the stopped diapason in an organ.
Occasionally, when the miller was bolting, there was added to these
continuous sounds the cheerful clicking of the hopper, which did not
deprive them of rest except when it was kept going all night; and over
and above all this they had the pleasure of knowing that there crept in
through every crevice, door, and window of their dwelling, however
tightly closed, a subtle mist of superfine flour from the grinding room,
quite invisible, but making its presence known in the course of time by
giving a pallid and ghostly look to the best furniture. The miller
frequently apologized to his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) tenants for the intrusion of this insidious
dry fog; but the widow was of a friendly and thankful nature, and she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
said that she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) did not mind it at all, being as it was, not nasty dirt,
but the blessed staff of life.

<p/>By good-humour of this sort, and in other ways, Mrs. Garland acknowledged
her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) friendship for her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) neighbour, with whom Anne and herself associated
to an extent which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) never could have anticipated when, tempted by the
lowness of the rent, they first removed thither after her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) husband's death
from a larger house at the other end of the village. Those who have
lived in remote places where there is what is called no society will
comprehend the gradual levelling of distinctions that went on in this
case at some sacrifice of gentility on the part of one household. The
widow was sometimes sorry to find with what readiness Anne caught up some
dialect-word or accent from the miller and his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) friends; but he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) was so
good and true-hearted a man, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) so easy-minded, unambitious a woman,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would not make life a solitude for fastidious reasons. More
than all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had good ground for thinking that the miller secretly
admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and this added a piquancy to the situation.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/>On a fine summer morning, when the leaves were warm under the sun, and
the more industrious bees abroad, diving into every blue and red cup that
could possibly be considered a flower, Anne was sitting at the back
window of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother's portion of the house, measuring out lengths of
worsted for a fringed rug that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was making, which lay, about three-
quarters finished, beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). The work, though chromatically brilliant,
was tedious: a hearth-rug was a thing which nobody worked at from morning
to night; it was taken up and put down; it was in the chair, on the
floor, across the hand-rail, under the bed, kicked here, kicked there,
rolled away in the closet, brought out again, and so on more capriciously
perhaps than any other home-made article. Nobody was expected to finish
a rug within a calculable period, and the wools of the beginning became
faded and historical before the end was reached. A sense of this
inherent nature of worsted-work rather than idleness led Anne to look
rather frequently from the open casement.

<p/>Immediately before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was the large, smooth millpond, over-full, and
intruding into the hedge and into the road. The water, with its flowing
leaves and spots of froth, was stealing away, like Time, under the dark
arch, to tumble over the great slimy wheel within. On the other side of
the mill-pond was an open place called the Cross, because it was three-
quarters of one, two lanes and a cattle-drive meeting there. It was the
general rendezvous and arena of the surrounding village. Behind this a
steep slope rose high into the sky, merging in a wide and open down, now
littered with sheep newly shorn. The upland by its height completely
sheltered the mill and village from north winds, making summers of
springs, reducing winters to autumn temperatures, and permitting myrtle
to flourish in the open air.

<p/>The heaviness of noon pervaded the scene, and under its influence the
sheep had ceased to feed. Nobody was standing at the Cross, the few
inhabitants being indoors at their dinner. No human being was on the
down, and no human eye or interest but Anne's seemed to be concerned with
it. The bees still worked on, and the butterflies did not rest from
roving, their smallness seeming to shield them from the stagnating effect
that this turning moment of day had on larger creatures. Otherwise all
was still.

<p/>The girl glanced at the down and the sheep for no particular reason; the
steep margin of turf and daisies rising above the roofs, chimneys, apple-
trees, and church tower of the hamlet around her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), bounded the view from
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) position, and it was necessary to look somewhere when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
head. While thus engaged in working and stopping her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) attention was
attracted by the sudden rising and running away of the sheep squatted on
the down; and there succeeded sounds of a heavy tramping over the hard
sod which the sheep had quitted, the tramp being accompanied by a
metallic jingle. Turning her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes further she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) beheld two cavalry
soldiers on bulky grey chargers, armed and accoutred throughout,
ascending the down at a point to the left where the incline was
comparatively easy. The burnished chains, buckles, and plates of their
trappings shone like little looking-glasses, and the blue, red, and white
about them was unsubdued by weather or wear.

<p/>The two troopers rode proudly on, as if nothing less than crowns and
empires ever concerned their magnificent minds. They reached that part
of the down which lay just in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), where they came to a halt. In
another minute there appeared behind them a group containing some half-
dozen more of the same sort. These came on, halted, and dismounted
likewise.

<p/>Two of the soldiers then walked some distance onward together, when one
stood still, the other advancing further, and stretching a white line of
tape between them. Two more of the men marched to another outlying
point, where they made marks in the ground. Thus they walked about and
took distances, obviously according to some preconcerted scheme.

<p/>At the end of this systematic proceeding one solitary horseman--a
commissioned officer, if his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) uniform could be judged rightly at that
distance--rode up the down, went over the ground, looked at what the
others had done, and seemed to think that it was good. And then the girl
heard yet louder tramps and clankings, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) beheld rising from where
the others had risen a whole column of cavalry in marching order. At a
distance behind these came a cloud of dust enveloping more and more
troops, their arms and accoutrements reflecting the sun through the haze
in faint flashes, stars, and streaks of light. The whole body approached
slowly towards the plateau at the top of the down.

<p/>Anne threw down her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) work, and letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes remain on the nearing
masses of cavalry, the worsteds getting entangled as they would, said,
<div class="bookquote">``Mother, mother; come here! Here's such a fine sight! What does it
mean? What can they be going to do up there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the masses</b></font>)</div><p/>The mother thus invoked ran upstairs and came forward to the window. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
was a woman of sanguine mouth and eye, unheroic manner, and pleasant
general appearance; a little more tarnished as to surface, but not much
worse in contour than the girl herself.

<p/>Widow Garland's thoughts were those of the period. <div class="bookquote">``Can it be the
French,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) said, arranging herself for the extremest form of
consternation. <div class="bookquote">``Can that arch-enemy of mankind have landed at last?''  (<font color='red'><b>Satan Buonaparte</b></font>)</div>It
should be stated that at this time there were two arch-enemies of
mankind--Satan as usual, and Buonaparte, who had sprung up and eclipsed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) elder rival altogether. Mrs. Garland alluded, of course, to the
junior gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It cannot be he (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne. <div class="bookquote">``Ah! there's Simon Burden, the man who
watches at the beacon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burden</b></font>)'ll know!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand to an aged form of the same colour as the road, who
had just appeared beyond the mill-pond, and who, though active, was bowed
to that degree which almost reproaches a feeling observer for standing
upright. The arrival of the soldiery had drawn him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) out from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) drop of
drink at the ``Duke of York' as it had attracted Anne. At her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) call he (<font color='blue'><b>Burden</b></font>)
crossed the mill-bridge, and came towards the window.

<p/>Anne inquired of him (<font color='blue'><b>Burden</b></font>) what it all meant; but Simon Burden, without
answering, continued to move on with parted gums, staring at the cavalry
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Burden</b></font>) own private account with a concern that people often show about
temporal phenomena when such matters can affect them but a short time
longer. <div class="bookquote">``You'll walk into the millpond!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne. <div class="bookquote">``What are they
doing? You were a soldier many years ago, and ought to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't ask me, Mis`ess Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the military relic, depositing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
body against the wall one limb at a time. <div class="bookquote">``I were only in the foot, ye
know, and never had a clear understanding of horses. Ay, I be a old man,
and of no judgment now.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Some additional pressure, however, caused him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
to search further in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) worm-eaten magazine of ideas, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) found that
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did know in a dim irresponsible way. The soldiers must have come
there to camp: those men they had seen first were the markers: they had
come on before the rest to measure out the ground. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) who had
accompanied them was the quartermaster. <div class="bookquote">``And so you see they have got
all the lines marked out by the time the regiment have come up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
added. <div class="bookquote">``And then they will--well-a-deary! who'd ha' supposed that
Overcombe would see such a day as this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``And then they will--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then-- Ah, it's gone from me again!''  (<font color='red'><b>Simon Burden/Simon</b></font>)</div>said Simon. <div class="bookquote">``O, and then they will
raise their tents, you know, and picket their horses. That was it; so it
was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>By this time the column of horse had ascended into full view, and they
formed a lively spectacle as they rode along the high ground in marching
order, backed by the pale blue sky, and lit by the southerly sun. Their
uniform was bright and attractive; white buckskin pantaloons,
three-quarter boots, scarlet shakos set off with lace, mustachios waxed
to a needle point; and above all, those richly ornamented blue jackets
mantled with the historic pelisse--that fascination to women, and
encumbrance to the wearers themselves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis the York Hussars!''  (<font color='red'><b>the wearers</b></font>)</div>said Simon Burden, brightening like a dying
ember fanned. <div class="bookquote">``Foreigners to a man, and enrolled long since my time. But
as good hearty comrades, they say, as you'll find in the King's service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here are more and different ones,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garland.

<p/>Other troops had, during the last few minutes, been ascending the down at
a remoter point, and now drew near. These were of different weight and
build from the others; lighter men, in helmet hats, with white plumes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know which I like best,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne. <div class="bookquote">``These, I think, after
all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Simon Burden/Simon</b></font>)</div><p/>Simon, who had been looking hard at the latter, now said that they were
the --th Dragoons.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All Englishmen they,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man. <div class="bookquote">``They lay at Budmouth barracks
a few years ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They did. I remember it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garland.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And lots of the chaps about here `listed at the time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Simon Burden/Simon</b></font>)</div>said Simon. <div class="bookquote">``I
can call to mind that there was--ah, `tis gone from me again! However,
all that's of little account now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The dragoons</b></font>)</div><p/>The dragoons passed in front of the lookers-on as the others had done,
and their gay plumes, which had hung lazily during the ascent, swung to
northward as they reached the top, showing that on the summit a fresh
breeze blew. <div class="bookquote">``But look across there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne. There had entered upon
the down from another direction several battalions of foot, in white
kerseymere breeches and cloth gaiters. They seemed to be weary from a
long march, the original black of their gaiters and boots being whity-
brown with dust. Presently came regimental waggons, and the private
canteen carts which followed at the end of a convoy.

<p/>The space in front of the mill-pond was now occupied by nearly all the
inhabitants of the village, who had turned out in alarm, and remained for
pleasure, their eyes lighted up with interest in what they saw; for
trappings and regimentals, war horses and men, in towns an attraction,
were here almost a sublimity.

<p/>The troops filed to their lines, dismounted, and in quick time took off
their accoutrements, rolled up their sheep-skins, picketed and unbitted
their horses, and made ready to erect the tents as soon as they could be
taken from the waggons and brought forward. When this was done, at a
given signal the canvases flew up from the sod; and thenceforth every man
had a place in which to lay his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head.

<p/>Though nobody seemed to be looking on but the few at the window and in
the village street, there were, as a matter of fact, many eyes converging
upon that military arrival in its high and conspicuous position, not to
mention the glances of birds and other wild creatures. Men in distant
gardens, women in orchards and at cottage-doors, shepherds on remote
hills, turnip-hoers in blue-green enclosures miles away, captains with
spy-glasses out at sea, were regarding the picture keenly. Those three
or four thousand men of one machine-like movement, some of them
swashbucklers by nature; others, doubtless, of a quiet shop-keeping
disposition who had inadvertently got into uniform--all of them had
arrived from nobody knew where, and hence were matter of great curiosity.
They seemed to the mere eye to belong to a different order of beings from
those who inhabited the valleys below. Apparently unconscious and
careless of what all the world was doing elsewhere, they remained
picturesquely engrossed in the business of making themselves a habitation
on the isolated spot which they had chosen.

<p/>Mrs. Garland was of a festive and sanguine turn of mind, a woman soon set
up and soon set down, and the coming of the regiments quite excited her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought there was reason for putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) best cap, thought that
perhaps there was not; that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would hurry on the dinner and go out in
the afternoon; then that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would, after all, do nothing unusual, nor
show any silly excitements whatever, since they were unbecoming in a
mother and a widow. Thus circumscribing her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) intentions till she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was
toned down to an ordinary person of forty, Mrs. Garland accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>)
daughter downstairs to dine, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Presently we will call on Miller
Loveday, and hear what he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) thinks of it all.''




 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>II. SOMEBODY KNOCKS AND COMES IN


<p/>Miller Loveday was the representative of an ancient family of
corn-grinders whose history is lost in the mists of antiquity. His (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
ancestral line was contemporaneous with that of De Ros, Howard, and De La
Zouche; but, owing to some trifling deficiency in the possessions of the
house of Loveday, the individual names and intermarriages of its members
were not recorded during the Middle Ages, and thus their private lives in
any given century were uncertain. But it was known that the family had
formed matrimonial alliances with farmers not so very small, and once
with a gentleman-tanner, who had for many years purchased after their
death the horses of the most aristocratic persons in the county--fiery
steeds that earlier in their career had been valued at many hundred
guineas.

<p/>It was also ascertained that Mr. Loveday's great-grandparents had been
eight in number, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) great-great-grandparents sixteen, every one of
whom reached to years of discretion: at every stage backwards his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) sires
and gammers thus doubled and doubled till they became a vast body of
Gothic ladies and gentlemen of the rank known as ceorls or villeins, full
of importance to the country at large, and ramifying throughout the
unwritten history of England. His (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) immediate father had greatly improved
the value of their residence by building a new chimney, and setting up an
additional pair of millstones.

<p/>Overcombe Mill presented at one end the appearance of a hard-worked house
slipping into the river, and at the other of an idle, genteel place, half-
cloaked with creepers at this time of the year, and having no visible
connexion with flour. It had hips instead of gables, giving it a round-
shouldered look, four chimneys with no smoke coming out of them, two
zigzag cracks in the wall, several open windows, with a looking-glass
here and there inside, showing its warped back to the passer-by; snowy
dimity curtains waving in the draught; two mill doors, one above the
other, the upper enabling a person to step out upon nothing at a height
of ten feet from the ground; a gaping arch vomiting the river, and a
lean, long-nosed fellow looking out from the mill doorway, who was the
hired grinder, except when a bulging fifteen stone man occupied the same
place, namely, the miller himself.

<p/>Behind the mill door, and invisible to the mere wayfarer who did not
visit the family, were chalked addition and subtraction sums, many of
them originally done wrong, and the figures half rubbed out and
corrected, noughts being turned into nines, and ones into twos. These
were the miller's private calculations. There were also chalked in the
same place rows and rows of strokes like open palings, representing the
calculations of the grinder, who in his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) youthful ciphering studies had
not gone so far as Arabic figures.

<p/>In the court in front were two worn-out millstones, made useful again by
being let in level with the ground. Here people stood to smoke and
consider things in muddy weather; and cats slept on the clean surfaces
when it was hot. In the large stubbard-tree at the corner of the garden
was erected a pole of larch fir, which the miller had bought with others
at a sale of small timber in Damer's Wood one Christmas week. It rose
from the upper boughs of the tree to about the height of a fisherman's
mast, and on the top was a vane in the form of a sailor with his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) arm
stretched out. When the sun shone upon this figure it could be seen that
the greater part of his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) countenance was gone, and the paint washed from
his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) body so far as to reveal that he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) had been a soldier in red before he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>)
became a sailor in blue. The image had, in fact, been John, one of our
coming characters, and was then turned into Robert, another of them. This
revolving piece of statuary could not, however, be relied on as a vane,
owing to the neighbouring hill, which formed variable currents in the
wind.

<p/>The leafy and quieter wing of the mill-house was the part occupied by
Mrs. Garland and her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) daughter, who made up in summer-time for the
narrowness of their quarters by overflowing into the garden on stools and
chairs. The parlour or dining-room had a stone floor--a fact which the
widow sought to disguise by double carpeting, lest the standing of Anne
and herself should be lowered in the public eye. Here now the mid-day
meal went lightly and mincingly on, as it does where there is no greedy
carnivorous man to keep the dishes about, and was hanging on the close
when somebody entered the passage as far as the chink of the parlour
door, and tapped. This proceeding was probably adopted to kindly avoid
giving trouble to Susan, the neighbour's pink daughter, who helped at
Mrs. Garland's in the mornings, but was at that moment particularly
occupied in standing on the water-butt and gazing at the soldiers, with
an inhaling position of the mouth and circular eyes.

<p/>There was a flutter in the little dining-room--the sensitiveness of
habitual solitude makes hearts beat for preternaturally small reasons--and
a guessing as to who the visitor might be. It was some military
gentleman from the camp perhaps? No; that was impossible. It was the
parson? No; he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) would not come at dinner-time. It was the well-informed
man who travelled with drapery and the best Birmingham earrings? Not at
all; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) time was not till Thursday at three. Before they could think
further the visitor moved forward another step, and the diners got a
glimpse of him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) through the same friendly chink that had afforded him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) a
view of the Garland dinner-table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O! It is only Loveday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>nobody</b></font>)</div><p/>This approximation to nobody was the miller above mentioned, a hale man
of fifty-five or sixty--hale all through, as many were in those days, and
not merely veneered with purple by exhilarating victuals and drinks,
though the latter were not at all despised by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face was indeed
rather pale than otherwise, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had just come from the mill. It was
capable of immense changes of expression: mobility was its essence, a
roll of flesh forming a buttress to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose on each side, and a deep
ravine lying between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lower lip and the tumulus represented by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
chin. These fleshy lumps moved stealthily, as if of their own accord,
whenever his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fancy was tickled.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes having lighted on the table-cloth, plates, and viands, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found
himself in a position which had a sensible awkwardness for a modest man
who always liked to enter only at seasonable times the presence of a girl
of such pleasantly soft ways as Anne Garland, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) who could make apples
seem like peaches, and throw over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shillings the glamour of guineas
when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) paid him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for flour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dinner is over, neighbour Loveday; please come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow,
seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) case. The miller said something about coming in presently;
but Anne pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to stay, with a tender motion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lip as it
played on the verge of a solicitous smile without quite lapsing into
one--her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) habitual manner when speaking.

<p/>Loveday took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) low-crowned hat and advanced. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had not come about
pigs or fowls this time. <div class="bookquote">``You have been looking out, like the rest o'
us, no doubt, Mrs. Garland, at the mampus of soldiers that have come upon
the down? Well, one of the horse regiments is the --th Dragoons, my son
John's regiment, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div><p/>The announcement, though it interested them, did not create such an
effect as the father of John had seemed to anticipate; but Anne, who
liked to say pleasant things, replied, <div class="bookquote">``The dragoons looked nicer than
the foot, or the German cavalry either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are a handsome body of men,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller in a disinterested
voice. <div class="bookquote">``Faith! I didn't know they were coming, though it may be in the
newspaper all the time. But old Derriman keeps it so long that we never
know things till they be in everybody's mouth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a nephew</b></font>)</div><p/>This Derriman was a squireen living near, who was chiefly distinguished
in the present warlike time by having a nephew in the yeomanry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We were told that the yeomanry went along the turnpike road yesterday,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne; `and they say that they were a pretty sight, and quite
soldierly.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! well--they be not regulars,''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Miller Loveday, keeping back
harsher criticism as uncalled for. But inflamed by the arrival of the
dragoons, which had been the exciting cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) call, his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) mind would
not go to yeomanry. <div class="bookquote">``John has not been home these five years,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what rank does he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hold now?''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'s trumpet-major, ma'am; and a good musician.''  (<font color='red'><b>The miller father</b></font>)</div>The miller, who was a
good father, went on to explain that John had seen some service, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
had enlisted when the regiment was lying in this neighbourhood, more than
eleven years before, which put his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father out of temper with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
had wished him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to follow on at the mill. But as the lad had enlisted
seriously, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had often said that he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) would be a soldier, the
miller had thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) would let Jack take his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) chance in the
profession of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) choice.

<p/>Loveday had two sons, and the second was now brought into the
conversation by a remark of Anne's that neither of them seemed to care
for the miller's business.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Loveday in a less buoyant tone. <div class="bookquote">``Robert, you see, must needs
go to sea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) is much younger than his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) brother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garland.

<p/>About four years, the miller told her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) soldier son was
two-and-thirty, and Bob was twenty-eight. When Bob returned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
present voyage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was to be persuaded to stay and assist as grinder in
the mill, and go to sea no more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A sailor-miller!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) knows as much about mill business as I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Loveday; `he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) was
intended for it, you know, like John. But, bless me!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``I
am before my story. I'm come more particularly to ask you, ma'am, and
you, Anne my honey, if you will join me and a few friends at a leetle
homely supper that I shall gi'e to please the chap now he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s come? I can
do no less than have a bit of a randy, as the saying is, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s
here safe and sound.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Garland wanted to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) daughter's eye; she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) was in some doubt
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) answer. But Anne's eye was not to be caught, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hated
hints, nods, and calculations of any kind in matters which should be
regulated by impulse; and the matron replied, <div class="bookquote">``If so be `tis possible,
we'll be there. You will tell us the day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had seen son John. <div class="bookquote">''`Twill be rather untidy, you
know, owing to my having no womenfolks in the house; and my man David is
a poor dunder-headed feller for getting up a feast. Poor chap! his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) sight
is bad, that's true, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s very good at making the beds, and oiling
the legs of the chairs and other furniture, or I should have got rid of
him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) years ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should have a woman to attend to the house, Loveday,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the
widow.

<p/>``Yes, I should, but--. Well, `tis a fine day, neighbours. Hark! I
fancy I hear the noise of pots and pans up at the camp, or my ears
deceive me. Poor fellows, they must be hungry! Good day t`ye, ma<div class="bookquote">``am.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And the miller went away.

<p/>All that afternoon Overcombe continued in a ferment of interest in the
military investment, which brought the excitement of an invasion without
the strife. There were great discussions on the merits and appearance of
the soldiery. The event opened up, to the girls unbounded possibilities
of adoring and being adored, and to the young men an embarrassment of
dashing acquaintances which quite superseded falling in love. Thirteen
of these lads incontinently stated within the space of a quarter of an
hour that there was nothing in the world like going for a soldier. The
young women stated little, but perhaps thought the more; though, in
justice, they glanced round towards the encampment from the corners of
their blue and brown eyes in the most demure and modest manner that could
be desired.

<p/>In the evening the village was lively with soldiers' wives; a tree full
of starlings would not have rivalled the chatter that was going on. These
ladies were very brilliantly dressed, with more regard for colour than
for material. Purple, red, and blue bonnets were numerous, with bunches
of cocks' feathers; and one had on an Arcadian hat of green sarcenet,
turned up in front to show her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) cap underneath. It had once belonged to
an officer's lady, and was not so much stained, except where the
occasional storms of rain, incidental to a military life, had caused the
green to run and stagnate in curious watermarks like peninsulas and
islands. Some of the prettiest of these butterfly wives had been
fortunate enough to get lodgings in the cottages, and were thus spared
the necessity of living in huts and tents on the down. Those who had not
been so fortunate were not rendered more amiable by the success of their
sisters-in-arms, and called them names which brought forth retorts and
rejoinders; till the end of these alternative remarks seemed dependent
upon the close of the day.

<p/>One of these new arrivals, who had a rosy nose and a slight thickness of
voice, which, as Anne said, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) couldn't help, poor thing, seemed to have
seen so much of the world, and to have been in so many campaigns, that
Anne would have liked to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) into their own house, so as to acquire
some of that practical knowledge of the history of England which the lady
possessed, and which could not be got from books. But the narrowness of
Mrs. Garland's rooms absolutely forbade this, and the houseless treasury
of experience was obliged to look for quarters elsewhere.

<p/>That night Anne retired early to bed. The events of the day, cheerful as
they were in themselves, had been unusual enough to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) a slight
headache. Before getting into bed she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went to the window, and lifted the
white curtains that hung across it. The moon was shining, though not as
yet into the valley, but just peeping above the ridge of the down, where
the white cones of the encampment were softly touched by its light. The
quarter-guard and foremost tents showed themselves prominently; but the
body of the camp, the officers' tents, kitchens, canteen, and
appurtenances in the rear were blotted out by the ground, because of its
height above her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could discern the forms of one or two sentries
moving to and fro across the disc of the moon at intervals. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could
hear the frequent shuffling and tossing of the horses tied to the
pickets; and in the other direction the miles-long voice of the sea,
whispering a louder note at those points of its length where hampered in
its ebb and flow by some jutting promontory or group of boulders. Louder
sounds suddenly broke this approach to silence; they came from the camp
of dragoons, were taken up further to the right by the camp of the
Hanoverians, and further on still by the body of infantry. It was
tattoo. Feeling no desire to sleep, she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) listened yet longer, looked at
Charles's Wain swinging over the church tower, and the moon ascending
higher and higher over the right-hand streets of tents, where, instead of
parade and bustle, there was nothing going on but snores and dreams, the
tired soldiers lying by this time under their proper canvases, radiating
like spokes from the pole of each tent.

<p/>At last Anne gave up thinking, and retired like the rest. The night wore
on, and, except the occasional ``All's well' of the sentries, no voice was
heard in the camp or in the village below.




<p/>III. THE MILL BECOMES AN IMPORTANT CENTRE OF OPERATIONS


<p/>The next morning Miss Garland awoke with an impression that something
more than usual was going on, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) recognized as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) could
clearly reason that the proceedings, whatever they might be, lay not far
away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) bedroom window. The sounds were chiefly those of pickaxes
and shovels. Anne got up, and, lifting the corner of the curtain about
an inch, peeped out.

<p/>A number of soldiers were busily engaged in making a zigzag path down the
incline from the camp to the river-head at the back of the house, and
judging from the quantity of work already got through they must have
begun very early. Squads of men were working at several equidistant
points in the proposed pathway, and by the time that Anne had dressed
herself each section of the length had been connected with those above
and below it, so that a continuous and easy track was formed from the
crest of the down to the bottom of the steep.

<p/>The down rested on a bed of solid chalk, and the surface exposed by the
roadmakers formed a white ribbon, serpenting from top to bottom.

<p/>Then the relays of working soldiers all disappeared, and, not long after,
a troop of dragoons in watering order rode forward at the top and began
to wind down the new path. They came lower and closer, and at last were
immediately beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>dragoons</b></font>) window, gathering themselves up on the space by
the mill-pond. A number of the horses entered it at the shallow part,
drinking and splashing and tossing about. Perhaps as many as thirty,
half of them with riders on their backs, were in the water at one time;
the thirsty animals drank, stamped, flounced, and drank again, letting
the clear, cool water dribble luxuriously from their mouths. Miller
Loveday was looking on from over his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) garden hedge, and many admiring
villagers were gathered around.

<p/>Gazing up higher, Anne saw other troops descending by the new road from
the camp, those which had already been to the pond making room for these
by withdrawing along the village lane and returning to the top by a
circuitous route.

<p/>Suddenly the miller exclaimed, as in fulfilment of expectation, <div class="bookquote">``Ah,
John, my boy; good morning!''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>And the reply of <div class="bookquote">``Morning, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>a soldier</b></font>)</div>came
from a well-mounted soldier near him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>), who did not, however, form one of
the watering party. Anne could not see his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) face very clearly, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
had no doubt that this was John Loveday.

<p/>There were tones in the voice which reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) of old times, those of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) very infancy, when Johnny Loveday had been top boy in the village
school, and had wanted to learn painting of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father. The deeps and
shallows of the mill-pond being better known to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) than to any other man
in the camp, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had apparently come down on that account, and was
cautioning some of the horsemen against riding too far in towards the
mill-head.

<p/>Since her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) childhood and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) enlistment Anne had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) only once, and
then but casually, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was home on a short furlough. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) figure was
not much changed from what it had been; but the many sunrises and sunsets
which had passed since that day, developing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) from a comparative child
to womanhood, had abstracted some of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) angularities, reddened his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) skin,
and given him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a foreign look. It was interesting to see what years of
training and service had done for this man. Few would have supposed that
the white and the blue coats of miller and soldier covered the forms of
father and son.

<p/>Before the last troop of dragoons rode off they were welcomed in a body
by Miller Loveday, who still stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) outer garden, this being a plot
lying below the mill-tail, and stretching to the water-side. It was just
the time of year when cherries are ripe, and hang in clusters under their
dark leaves. While the troopers loitered on their horses, and chatted to
the miller across the stream, he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) gathered bunches of the fruit, and held
them up over the garden hedge for the acceptance of anybody who would
have them; whereupon the soldiers rode into the water to where it had
washed holes in the garden bank, and, reining their horses there, caught
the cherries in their forage-caps, or received bunches of them on the
ends of their switches, with the dignified laugh that became martial men
when stooping to slightly boyish amusement. It was a cheerful, careless,
unpremeditated half-hour, which returned like the scent of a flower to
the memories of some of those who enjoyed it, even at a distance of many
years after, when they lay wounded and weak in foreign lands.

<p/>Then dragoons and horses wheeled off as the others had done; and troops
of the German Legion next came down and entered in panoramic procession
the space below Anne's eyes, as if on purpose to gratify her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). These were
notable by their mustachios, and queues wound tightly with brown ribbon
to the level of their broad shoulder-blades. They were charmed, as the
others had been, by the head and neck of Miss Garland in the little
square window overlooking the scene of operations, and saluted her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) with
devoted foreign civility, and in such overwhelming numbers that the
modest girl suddenly withdrew herself into the room, and had a private
blush between the chest of drawers and the washing-stand.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came downstairs her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother said, <div class="bookquote">``I have been thinking what I
ought to wear to Miller Loveday's to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>``To Miller Loveday<div class="bookquote">``s?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. The party is to-night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) has been in here this morning to tell
me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) has seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) son, and they have fixed this evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think we ought to go, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne slowly, and looking at
the smaller features of the window-flowers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garland.

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) will only have men there except ourselves, will he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)? And shall we be
right to go alone among <div class="bookquote">``em?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne had not recovered from the ardent gaze of the gallant York Hussars,
whose voices reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) even now in converse with Loveday.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``La, Anne, how proud you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Widow Garland</b></font>)</div>said Widow Garland. <div class="bookquote">``Why, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) our
nearest neighbour and our landlord? and don't he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) always fetch our faggots
from the wood, and keep us in vegetables for next to nothing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we can't be distant with the man. And if the enemy land next
autumn, as everybody says they will, we shall have quite to depend upon
the miller's waggon and horses. He (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>)'s our only friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, so he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne. <div class="bookquote">``And you had better go, mother; and I'll
stay at home. They will be all men; and I don't like going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Garland reflected. ``Well, if you don't want to go, I don``t,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, as you are growing up, it would be better to stay at
home this time. Your father was a professional man, certainly.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Having
spoken as a mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sighed as a woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you sigh, mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are so prim and stiff about everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well--we'll go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no--I am not sure that we ought. I did not promise, and there will be
no trouble in keeping away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne apparently did not feel certain of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own opinion, and, instead of
supporting or contradicting, looked thoughtfully down, and abstractedly
brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hands together on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) bosom, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) fingers met tip to tip.

<p/>As the day advanced the young woman and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother became aware that
great preparations were in progress in the miller's wing of the house.
The partitioning between the Lovedays and the Garlands was not very
thorough, consisting in many cases of a simple screwing up of the doors
in the dividing walls; and thus when the mill began any new performances
they proclaimed themselves at once in the more private dwelling. The
smell of Miller Loveday's pipe came down Mrs. Garland's chimney of an
evening with the greatest regularity. Every time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) poked his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) fire
they knew from the vehemence or deliberateness of the blows the precise
state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) mind; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) wound his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) clock on Sunday nights the whirr
of that monitor reminded the widow to wind hers. This transit of noises
was most perfect where Loveday's lobby adjoined Mrs. Garland's pantry;
and Anne, who was occupied for some time in the latter apartment, enjoyed
the privilege of hearing the visitors arrive and of catching stray sounds
and words without the connecting phrases that made them entertaining, to
judge from the laughter they evoked. The arrivals passed through the
house and went into the garden, where they had tea in a large
summer-house, an occasional blink of bright colour, through the foliage,
being all that was visible of the assembly from Mrs. Garland's windows.
When it grew dusk they all could be heard coming indoors to finish the
evening in the parlour.

<p/>Then there was an intensified continuation of the above-mentioned signs
of enjoyment, talkings and haw-haws, runnings upstairs and runnings down,
a slamming of doors and a clinking of cups and glasses; till the proudest
adjoining tenant without friends on his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) own side of the partition might
have been tempted to wish for entrance to that merry dwelling, if only to
know the cause of these fluctuations of hilarity, and to see if the
guests were really so numerous, and the observations so very amusing as
they seemed.

<p/>The stagnation of life on the Garland side of the party-wall began to
have a very gloomy effect by the contrast. When, about half-past nine
o'clock, one of these tantalizing bursts of gaiety had resounded for a
longer time than usual, Anne said, <div class="bookquote">``I believe, mother, that you are
wishing you had gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I own to feeling that it would have been very cheerful if we had joined
in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garland, in a hankering tone. <div class="bookquote">``I was rather too nice in
listening to you and not going. The parson never calls upon us except in
his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) spiritual capacity. Old Derriman is hardly genteel; and there's
nobody left to speak to. Lonely people must accept what company they can
get.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or do without it altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not natural, Anne; and I am surprised to hear a young woman like
you say such a thing. Nature will not be stifled in that way...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Song and powerful chorus heard through partition.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``I declare the room
on the other side of the wall seems quite a paradise compared with this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, you are quite a girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne in slightly superior accents.
<div class="bookquote">``Go in and join them by all means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no--not now,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother, resignedly shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head. ``It is
too late now. We ought to have taken advantage of the invitation. They
would look hard at me as a poor mortal who had no real business there,
and the miller would say, with his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) broad smile, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, you be obliged to
come round.'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>While the sociable and unaspiring Mrs. Garland continued thus to pass the
evening in two places, her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) body in her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) own house and her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) mind in the
miller's, somebody knocked at the door, and directly after the elder
Loveday himself was admitted to the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) was dressed in a suit
between grand and gay, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) used for such occasions as the present,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) blue coat, yellow and red waistcoat with the three lower buttons
unfastened, steel-buckled shoes and speckled stockings, became him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) very
well in Mrs. Martha Garland's eyes.

<p/>``Your servant, ma``am,'' said the miller, adopting as a matter of propriety
the raised standard of politeness required by his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) higher costume. ``Now,
begging your pardon, I can't hae this. <div class="bookquote">``Tis unnatural that you two
ladies should be biding here and we under the same roof making merry
without ye. Your husband, poor man--lovely picters that a' would make to
be sure--would have been in with us long ago if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been in your
place. I can take no nay from ye, upon my honour. You and maidy Anne
must come in, if it be only for half-an-hour. John and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) friends have
got passes till twelve o'clock to-night, and, saving a few of our own
village folk, the lowest visitor present is a very genteel German
corporal. If you should hae any misgivings on the score of
respectability, ma'am, we'll pack off the underbred ones into the back
kitchen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Widow</b></font>)</div><p/>Widow Garland and Anne looked yes at each other after this appeal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll follow you in a few minutes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the elder, smiling; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>)
rose with Anne to go upstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'll wait for ye,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller doggedly; `or perhaps you'll
alter your mind again.''

<p/>While the mother and daughter were upstairs dressing, and saying
laughingly to each other, <div class="bookquote">``Well, we must go now,''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>as if they hadn't
wished to go all the evening, other steps were heard in the passage; and
the miller cried from below, <div class="bookquote">``Your pardon, Mrs. Garland; but my son John
has come to help fetch ye. Shall I ask him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) in till ye be ready?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly; I shall be down in a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>screamed Anne's mother in a
slanting voice towards the staircase.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) descended, the outline of the trumpet-major appeared half-way
down the passage. <div class="bookquote">``This is John,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller simply. <div class="bookquote">``John, you
can mind Mrs. Martha Garland very well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dragoon</b></font>)</div>said the dragoon, coming in a little further. ``I
should have called to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) last time, but I was only home a week. How
is your little girl, ma<div class="bookquote">``am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Garland said Anne was quite well. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is grown-up now. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will
be down in a moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a slight noise of military heels without the door, at which the
trumpet-major went and put his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) head outside, and said, <div class="bookquote">``All right--coming
in a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>when voices in the darkness replied, <div class="bookquote">``No hurry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More friends?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garland.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, it is only Buck and Jones come to fetch me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>said the soldier. ``Shall
I ask 'em in a minute, Mrs Garland, ma<div class="bookquote">``am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady forms</b></font>)</div>said the lady; and the two interesting forms of Trumpeter Buck
and Saddler-sergeant Jones then came forward in the most friendly manner;
whereupon other steps were heard without, and it was discovered that
Sergeant-master-tailor Brett and Farrier-extraordinary Johnson were
outside, having come to fetch Messrs. Buck and Jones, as Buck and Jones
had come to fetch the trumpet-major.

<p/>As there seemed a possibility of Mrs. Garland's small passage being
choked up with human figures personally unknown to her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) was relieved
to hear Anne coming downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's my little girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garland, and the trumpet-major looked
with a sort of awe upon the muslin apparition who came forward, and stood
quite dumb before her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>). Anne recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) as the trooper she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had seen
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) window, and welcomed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) kindly. There was something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)
honest face which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) feel instantly at home with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>).

<p/>At this frankness of manner Loveday--who was not a ladies' man--blushed,
and made some alteration in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bodily posture, began a sentence which
had no end, and showed quite a boy's embarrassment. Recovering himself,
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) politely offered his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arm, which Anne took with a very pretty grace. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
conducted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) through his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) comrades, who glued themselves perpendicularly
to the wall to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) pass, and then they went out of the door, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
mother following with the miller, and supported by the body of troopers,
the latter walking with the usual cavalry gait, as if their thighs were
rather too long for them. Thus they crossed the threshold of the mill-
house and up the passage, the paving of which was worn into a gutter by
the ebb and flow of feet that had been going on there ever since Tudor
times.




<p/>IV. WHO WERE PRESENT AT THE MILLER``S LITTLE ENTERTAINMENT


<p/>When the group entered the presence of the company a lull in the
conversation was caused by the sight of new visitors, and -LRB-of course-RRB- by
the charm of Anne's appearance; until the old men, who had daughters of
their own, perceiving that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was only a half-formed girl, resumed their
tales and toss-potting with unconcern.

<p/>Miller Loveday had fraternized with half the soldiers in the camp since
their arrival, and the effect of this upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) party was striking--both
chromatically and otherwise. Those among the guests who first attracted
the eye were the sergeants and sergeant-majors of Loveday's regiment,
fine hearty men, who sat facing the candles, entirely resigned to
physical comfort. Then there were other non-commissioned officers, a
German, two Hungarians, and a Swede, from the foreign hussars--young men
with a look of sadness on their faces, as if they did not much like
serving so far from home. All of them spoke English fairly well. Old
age was represented by Simon Burden the pensioner, and the shady side of
fifty by Corporal Tullidge, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tullidge</b></font>) friend and neighbour, who was hard of
hearing, and sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tullidge</b></font>) hat on over a red cotton handkerchief that was
wound several times round his (<font color='blue'><b>Tullidge</b></font>) head. These two veterans were employed as
watchers at the neighbouring beacon, which had lately been erected by the
Lord-Lieutenant for firing whenever the descent on the coast should be
made. They lived in a little hut on the hill, close by the heap of
faggots; but to-night they had found deputies to watch in their stead.

<p/>On a lower plane of experience and qualifications came neighbour James
Comfort, of the Volunteers, a soldier by courtesy, but a blacksmith by
rights; also William Tremlett and Anthony Cripplestraw, of the local
forces. The two latter men of war were dressed merely as villagers, and
looked upon the regulars from a humble position in the background. The
remainder of the party was made up of a neighbouring dairyman or two, and
their wives, invited by the miller, as Anne was glad to see, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother should not be the only women there.

<p/>The elder Loveday apologized in a whisper to Mrs. Garland for the
presence of the inferior villagers. <div class="bookquote">``But as they are learning to be
brave defenders of their home and country, ma'am, as fast as they can
master the drill, and have worked for me off and on these many years,
I've asked 'em in, and thought you'd excuse it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, Miller Loveday,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow.

<p/>``And the same of old Burden and Tullidge. They have served well and long
in the Foot, and even now have a hard time of it up at the beacon in wet
weather. So after giving them a meal in the kitchen I just asked 'em in
to hear the singing. They faithfully promise that as soon as ever the
gunboats appear in view, and they have fired the beacon, to run down here
first, in case we shouldn't see it. <div class="bookquote">``Tis worth while to be friendly with
'em, you see, though their tempers be queer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite worth while, miller,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>).

<p/>Anne was rather embarrassed by the presence of the regular military in
such force, and at first confined her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) words to the dairymen's wives she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
was acquainted with, and to the two old soldiers of the parish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't ye speak to me afore, chiel?''  (<font color='red'><b>Corporal</b></font>)</div>said one of these, Corporal
Tullidge, the elderly man with the hat, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was talking to old
Simon Burden. <div class="bookquote">``I met ye in the lane yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Burden</b></font>) added reproachfully,
`but ye didn't notice me at all.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said; but, being afraid to shout in such a
company, the effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) remark upon the corporal was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had not
spoken at all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You was coming along with yer head full of some high notions or other no
doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>the corporal</b></font>)</div>continued the uncompromising corporal in the same loud voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah, `tis the young bucks that get all the notice nowadays, and old folks
are quite forgot! I can mind well enough how young Bob Loveday used to
lie in wait for ye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne blushed deeply, and stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>corporal</b></font>) too excursive discourse by hastily
saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) always respected old folks like him (<font color='blue'><b>corporal</b></font>). The corporal
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) inquired why he (<font color='blue'><b>corporal</b></font>) always kept his (<font color='blue'><b>corporal</b></font>) hat on, and answered that it
was because his (<font color='blue'><b>corporal</b></font>) head was injured at Valenciennes, in July, Ninety-three.
<div class="bookquote">``We were trying to bomb down the tower, and a piece of the shell struck
me. I was no more nor less than a dead man for two days. If it hadn't a
been for that and my smashed arm I should have come home none the worse
for my five-and-twenty years' service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have got a silver plate let into yer head, haven't ye, corpel?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cripplestraw/Anthony Cripplestraw/Anthony</b></font>)</div>said
Anthony Cripplestraw, who had drawn near. ``I have heard that the way
they morticed yer skull was a beautiful piece of workmanship. Perhaps
the young woman would like to see the place? <div class="bookquote">``Tis a curious sight,
Mis`ess Anne; you don't see such a wownd every day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne hurriedly, dreading, as did all the young
people of Overcombe, the spectacle of the corporal uncovered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) had
never been seen in public without the hat and the handkerchief since his (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>)
return in Ninety-four; and strange stories were told of the ghastliness
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) appearance bare-headed, a little boy who had accidentally beheld
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) going to bed in that state having been frightened into fits.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if the young woman don't want to see yer head, maybe she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d like to
hear yer arm?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cripplestraw/Anthony Cripplestraw/Anthony</b></font>)</div>continued Cripplestraw, earnest to please her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey?''  (<font color='red'><b>the corporal</b></font>)</div>said the corporal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your arm hurt too?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>cried Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Knocked to a pummy at the same time as my head,''  (<font color='red'><b>Corporal Tullidge/Tullidge</b></font>)</div>said Tullidge
dispassionately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rattle yer arm, corpel, and show her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Cripplestraw/Anthony Cripplestraw/Anthony</b></font>)</div>said Cripplestraw.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>the corporal</b></font>)</div>said the corporal, raising the limb slowly, as if the glory
of exhibition had lost some of its novelty, though he (<font color='blue'><b>corporal</b></font>) was willing to
oblige. Twisting it mercilessly about with his (<font color='blue'><b>corporal</b></font>) right hand he (<font color='blue'><b>corporal</b></font>) produced a
crunching among the bones at every motion, Cripplestraw seeming to derive
great satisfaction from the ghastly sound.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How very shocking!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, painfully anxious for him (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) to leave off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, it don't hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), bless ye. Do it, corpel?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cripplestraw/Anthony Cripplestraw/Anthony</b></font>)</div>said Cripplestraw.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>the corporal</b></font>)</div>said the corporal, still working his (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) arm with great energy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no life in the bones at all. No life in 'em, I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),
corpel!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They be as loose as a bag of ninepins,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cripplestraw/Anthony Cripplestraw/Anthony</b></font>)</div>explained Cripplestraw in
continuation. <div class="bookquote">``You can feel 'em quite plain, Mis`ess Anne. If ye would
like to, he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll undo his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sleeve in a minute to oblege ye?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no, no, please not! I quite understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the young woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) want to hear or see any more, or don't she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the corporal
inquired, with a sense that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) time was getting wasted.

<p/>Anne explained that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not on any account; and managed to escape
from the corner.




<p/>V. THE SONG AND THE STRANGER


<p/>The trumpet-major now contrived to place himself near her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), Anne's
presence having evidently been a great pleasure to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) since the moment
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) first seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was quite at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ease with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>), and asked
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) thought that Buonaparte would really come during the summer,
and many other questions which the gallant dragoon could not answer, but
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) nevertheless liked to be asked. William Tremlett, who had not
enjoyed a sound night's rest since the First Consul's menace had become
known, pricked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Consul</b></font>) ears at sound of this subject, and inquired if
anybody had seen the terrible flat-bottomed boats that the enemy were to
cross in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My brother Robert saw several of them paddling about the shore the last
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) passed the Straits of Dover,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the trumpet-major; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Consul</b></font>)
further startled the company by informing them that there were supposed
to be more than fifteen hundred of these boats, and that they would carry
a hundred men apiece. So that a descent of one hundred and fifty
thousand men might be expected any day as soon as Boney had brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Boney</b></font>)
plans to bear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord ha' mercy upon us!''  (<font color='red'><b>William Tremlett/Tremlett/William</b></font>)</div>said William Tremlett.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The night-time is when they will try it, if they try it at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said
old Tullidge, in the tone of one whose watch at the beacon must, in the
nature of things, have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Tremlett</b></font>) comprehensive views of the situation.
<div class="bookquote">``It is my belief that the point they will choose for making the shore is
just over there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tremlett</b></font>) nodded with indifference towards a section of
the coast at a hideous nearness to the house in which they were
assembled, whereupon Fencible Tremlett, and Cripplestraw of the Locals,
tried to show no signs of trepidation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When d'ye think `twill be?''  (<font color='red'><b>Volunteer</b></font>)</div>said Volunteer Comfort, the blacksmith.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't answer to a day,''  (<font color='red'><b>the corporal</b></font>)</div>said the corporal, `but it will certainly be
in a down-channel tide; and instead of pulling hard against it, he (<font color='blue'><b>corporal</b></font>)'ll let
his (<font color='blue'><b>corporal</b></font>) boats drift, and that will bring 'em right into Budmouth Bay. <div class="bookquote">``Twill
be a beautiful stroke of war, if so be `tis quietly done!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Beautiful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cripplestraw/Anthony Cripplestraw/Anthony</b></font>)</div>said Cripplestraw, moving inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) clothes. <div class="bookquote">``But how if
we should be all abed, corpel? You can't expect a man to be brave in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
shirt, especially we Locals, that have only got so far as shoulder fire-
locks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s not coming this summer. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll never come at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>a sergeant-major</b></font>)</div>said a tall
sergeant-major decisively.

<p/>Loveday the soldier was too much engaged in attending upon Anne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
mother to join in these surmises, bestirring himself to get the ladies
some of the best liquor the house afforded, which had, as a matter of
fact, crossed the Channel as privately as Buonaparte wished his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) army to
do, and had been landed on a dark night over the cliff. After this he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
asked Anne to sing, but though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had a very pretty voice in private
performances of that nature, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) declined to oblige him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>); turning the
subject by making a hesitating inquiry about his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) brother Robert, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
had mentioned just before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Robert is as well as ever, thank you, Miss Garland,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) is
now mate of the brig Pewit--rather young for such a command; but the
owner puts great trust in him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>the person</b></font>)</div>The trumpet-major added, deepening his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
thoughts to a profounder view of the person discussed, <div class="bookquote">``Bob is in love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the person</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne looked conscious, and listened attentively; but Loveday did not go
on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Much?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't exactly say. And the strange part of it is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) never tells
us who the woman is. Nobody knows at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) will tell, of course?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, in the remote tone of a person with
whose sex such matters had no connexion whatever.

<p/>Loveday shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) head, and the tete-a-tete was put an end to by a burst
of singing from one of the sergeants, who was followed at the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
song by others, each giving a ditty in his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) turn; the singer standing up
in front of the table, stretching his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) chin well into the air, as though
to abstract every possible wrinkle from his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) throat, and then plunging
into the melody. When this was over one of the foreign hussars--the
genteel German of Miller Loveday's description, who called himself a
Hungarian, and in reality belonged to no definite country--performed at
Trumpet-major Loveday's request the series of wild motions that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
denominated his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) national dance, that Anne might see what it was like.
Miss Garland was the flower of the whole company; the soldiers one and
all, foreign and English, seemed to be quite charmed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) presence, as
indeed they well might be, considering how seldom they came into the
society of such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>).

<p/>Anne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother were just thinking of retiring to their own dwelling
when Sergeant Stanner of the --th Foot, who was recruiting at Budmouth,
began a satirical song:--

<p/>When law'-yers strive' to heal' a breach',
And par-sons prac'-tise what' they preach';
Then lit'-tle Bo-ney he (<font color='blue'><b>Stanner</b></font>)'ll pounce down',
And march' his (<font color='blue'><b>Stanner</b></font>) men' on Lon'-don town'!

<p/>Chorus.--Rol'-li-cum ro'-rum, tol'-lol-lo'-rum,
Rol'-li-cum ro'-rum, tol'-lol-lay.

<p/>When jus'-ti-ces' hold e`qual scales',
And rogues' are on'-ly found' in jails';
Then lit`tle Bo'-ney he (<font color='blue'><b>Bo</b></font>)'ll pounce down',
And march' his (<font color='blue'><b>Bo</b></font>) men' on Lon'-don town'!

<p/>Chorus.--Rol'-li-cum ro'-rum, tol'-lol-lo'-rum,
Rol'-li-cum ro'-rum, tol'-lol-lay.

<p/>When rich' men find' their wealth' a curse',
And fill' there-with' the poor' man's purse';
Then lit'-tle Bo'-ney he (<font color='blue'><b>Bo</b></font>)'ll pounce down',
And march' his (<font color='blue'><b>Bo</b></font>) men' on Lon'-don town'!

<p/>Chorus.--Rol'-li-cum ro'-rum, tol'-lol-lo'-rum,
Rol'-li-cum ro'-rum, tol'-lol-lay.

<p/>Poor Stanner! In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stanner</b></font>) satire, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stanner</b></font>) fell at the bloody battle of
Albuera a few years after this pleasantly spent summer at the Georgian
watering-place, being mortally wounded and trampled down by a French
hussar when the brigade was deploying into line under Beresford.

<p/>While Miller Loveday was saying <div class="bookquote">``Well done, Mr. Stanner!''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>at the close of
the thirteenth stanza, which seemed to be the last, and Mr. Stanner was
modestly expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Stanner</b></font>) regret that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stanner</b></font>) could do no better, a stentorian
voice was heard outside the window shutter repeating,

<p/>Rol'-li-cum ro'-rum, tol'-lol-lo'-rum,
Rol'-li-cum ro'-rum, tol'-lol-lay.

<p/>The company was silent in a moment at this reinforcement, and only the
military tried not to look surprised. While all wondered who the singer
could be somebody entered the porch; the door opened, and in came a young
man, about the size and weight of the Farnese Hercules, in the uniform of
the yeomanry cavalry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis young Squire Derriman, old Mr. Derriman's nephew,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Farnese Hercules</b></font>)</div>murmured voices
in the background.

<p/>Without waiting to address anybody, or apparently seeing who were
gathered there, the colossal man waved his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cap above his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head and went on
in tones that shook the window-panes:--

<p/>When hus'-bands with' their wives' agree'.
And maids' won't wed' from mod'-es-ty',
Then lit'-tle Bo'-ney he (<font color='blue'><b>Bo</b></font>)'ll pounce down',
And march' his (<font color='blue'><b>Bo</b></font>) men' on Lon'-don town'!

<p/>Chorus.--Rol'-li-cum ro'-rum, tol'-lol-lo'-rum,
Rol'-li-cum ro'-rum, tol'-lol-lay.

<p/>It was a verse which had been omitted by the gallant Stanner, out of
respect to the ladies.

<p/>The new-comer was red-haired and of florid complexion, and seemed full of
a conviction that his (<font color='blue'><b>Stanner</b></font>) whim of entering must be their pleasure, which for
the moment it was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No ceremony, good men all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stanner</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I was passing by, and my ear was
caught by the singing. I like singing; `tis warming and cheering, and
shall not be put down. I should like to hear anybody say otherwise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Welcome, Master Derriman,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller, filling a glass and handing
it to the yeoman. <div class="bookquote">``Come all the way from quarters, then? I hardly
knowed ye in your soldier's clothes. You'd look more natural with a spud
in your hand, sir. I shouldn't ha' known ye at all if I hadn't heard
that you were called out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More natural with a spud!--have a care, miller,''  (<font color='red'><b>the giant fire</b></font>)</div>said the young giant,
the fire of his (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) complexion increasing to scarlet. <div class="bookquote">``I don't mean anger,
but--but--a soldier's honour, you know!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the yeoman</b></font>)</div><p/>The military in the background laughed a little, and the yeoman then for
the first time discovered that there were more regulars present than one.
He (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) looked momentarily disconcerted, but expanded again to full assurance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right, right, Master Derriman, no offence--'twas only my joke,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the
genial miller. <div class="bookquote">``Everybody's a soldier nowadays. Drink a drap o' this
cordial, and don't mind words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man drank without the least reluctance, and said, ``Yes, miller,
I am called out. <div class="bookquote">``Tis ticklish times for us soldiers now; we hold our
lives in our hands--What are those fellows grinning at behind the
table?--I say, we do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Staying with your uncle at the farm for a day or two, Mr. Derriman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No, no; as I told you, six mile off. Billeted at Casterbridge. But I
have to call and see the old, old--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gentleman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gentleman!--no, skinflint. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gentleman</b></font>) lives upon the sweepings of the barton;
ha, ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div>And the speaker's regular white teeth showed themselves like
snow in a Dutch cabbage. ``Well, well, the profession of arms makes a man
proof against all that. I take things as I find <div class="bookquote">``em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite right, Master Derriman. Another drop?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no. I'll take no more than is good for me--no man should; so don't
tempt me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The yeoman</b></font>)</div><p/>The yeoman then saw Anne, and by an unconscious gravitation went towards
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and the other women, flinging a remark to John Loveday in passing.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah, Loveday! I heard you were come; in short, I come o' purpose to see
you. Glad to see you enjoying yourself at home again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The trumpet-major replied civilly, though not without grimness, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
seemed hardly to like Derriman's motion towards Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Widow Garland's daughter!--yes, `tis! surely. You remember me? I have
been here before. Festus Derriman, Yeomanry Cavalry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne gave a little curtsey. <div class="bookquote">``I know your name is Festus--that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, `tis well known--especially latterly.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) voice to
confidence pitch. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose your friends here are disturbed by my
coming in, as they don't seem to talk much? I don't mean to interrupt
the party; but I often find that people are put out by my coming among
'em, especially when I've got my regimentals on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``La! and are they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; `tis the way I have.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) further lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) tone, as if they had
been old friends, though in reality he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) had only seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) three or four
times. <div class="bookquote">``And how did you come to be here? Dash my wig, I don't like to
see a nice young lady like you in this company. You should come to some
of our yeomanry sprees in Casterbridge or Shottsford-Forum. O, but the
girls do come! The yeomanry are respected men, men of good substantial
families, many farming their own land; and every one among us rides his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
own charger, which is more than these cussed fellows do.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) nodded
towards the dragoons.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, hush! Why, these are friends and neighbours of Miller Loveday,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) is a great friend of ours--our best friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne with great
emphasis, and reddening at the sense of injustice to their host. <div class="bookquote">``What
are you thinking of, talking like that? It is ungenerous in you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha, ha! I've affronted you. Isn't that it, fair angel, fair--what do
you call it?--fair vestal? Ah, well! would you was safe in my own house!
But honour must be minded now, not courting. Rollicum-rorum, tol-lol-
lorum. Pardon me, my sweet, I like ye! It may be a come down for me,
owning land; but I do like ye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, please be quiet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, distressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will, I will. Well, Corporal Tullidge, how's your head?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) said,
going towards the other end of the room, and leaving Anne to herself.

<p/>The company had again recovered its liveliness, and it was a long time
before the bouncing Rufus who had joined them could find heart to tear
himself away from their society and good liquors, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) had had
quite enough of the latter before he (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) entered. The natives received him (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>)
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) own valuation, and the soldiers of the camp, who sat beyond the
table, smiled behind their pipes at his (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) remarks, with a pleasant twinkle
of the eye which approached the satirical, John Loveday being not the
least conspicuous in this bearing. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) friends were too
courteous on such an occasion as the present to challenge the young man's
large remarks, and readily permitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) to set them right on the details
of camping and other military routine, about which the troopers seemed
willing to let persons hold any opinion whatever, provided that they
themselves were not obliged to give attention to it; showing, strangely
enough, that if there was one subject more than another which never
interested their minds, it was the art of war. To them the art of
enjoying good company in Overcombe Mill, the details of the miller's
household, the swarming of his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) bees, the number of his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) chickens, and the
fatness of his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) pigs, were matters of infinitely greater concern.

<p/>The present writer, to whom this party has been described times out of
number by members of the Loveday family and other aged people now passed
away, can never enter the old living-room of Overcombe Mill without
beholding the genial scene through the mists of the seventy or eighty
years that intervene between then and now. First and brightest to the
eye are the dozen candles, scattered about regardless of expense, and
kept well snuffed by the miller, who walks round the room at intervals of
five minutes, snuffers in hand, and nips each wick with great precision,
and with something of an executioner's grim look upon his (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) face as he (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>)
closes the snuffers upon the neck of the candle. Next to the
candle-light show the red and blue coats and white breeches of the
soldiers--nearly twenty of them in all besides the ponderous Derriman--the
head of the latter, and, indeed, the heads of all who are standing up,
being in dangerous proximity to the black beams of the ceiling. There is
not one among them who would attach any meaning to <div class="bookquote">``Vittoria,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>or gather
from the syllables ``Waterloo' the remotest idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tullidge</b></font>) own glory or
death. Next appears the correct and innocent Anne, little thinking what
things Time has in store for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) at no great distance off. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) looks at
Derriman with a half-uneasy smile as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tullidge</b></font>) clanks hither and thither, and
hopes he (<font color='blue'><b>Tullidge</b></font>) will not single her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) out again to hold a private dialogue
with--which, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tullidge</b></font>) does, irresistibly attracted by the white muslin
figure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must, of course, look a little gracious again now, lest his (<font color='blue'><b>Tullidge</b></font>)
mood should turn from sentimental to quarrelsome--no impossible
contingency with the yeoman-soldier, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) quick perception had noted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well; this idling won't do for me, folks,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) at last said, to
Anne's relief. ``I ought not to have come in, by rights; but I heard you
enjoying yourselves, and thought it might be worth while to see what you
were up to; I have several miles to go before bedtime;' and stretching
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tullidge</b></font>) arms, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tullidge</b></font>) chin, and shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Tullidge</b></font>) head, to eradicate any
unseemly curve or wrinkle from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tullidge</b></font>) person, the yeoman wished them an off-
hand good-night, and departed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should have teased him (<font color='blue'><b>Tullidge</b></font>) a little more, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the
trumpet-major drily. <div class="bookquote">``You could soon have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tullidge</b></font>) as crabbed as a
bear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't want to provoke the chap--'twasn't worth while. He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) came in
friendly enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the gentle miller without looking up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was overmuch friendly,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis as well to be neighbourly with folks, if they be not quite
onbearable,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father genially replied, as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) coat to go
and draw more ale--this periodical stripping to the shirt-sleeves being
necessitated by the narrowness of the cellar and the smeary effect of its
numerous cobwebs upon best clothes.

<p/>Some of the guests then spoke of Fess Derriman as not such a bad young
man if you took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right and humoured him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); others said that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
nobody's enemy but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own; and the elder ladies mentioned in a tone of
interest that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was likely to come into a deal of money at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uncle's
death. The person who did not praise was the one who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best, who
had known him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as a boy years ago, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had lived nearer to Overcombe
than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did at present. This unappreciative person was the
trumpet-major.




<p/>VI. OLD MR. DERRIMAN OF OXWELL HALL


<p/>At this time in the history of Overcombe one solitary newspaper
occasionally found its way into the village. It was lent by the
postmaster at Budmouth -LRB-who, in some mysterious way, got it for nothing
through his (<font color='blue'><b>postmaster</b></font>) connexion with the mail-RRB- to Mr. Derriman at the Hall, by whom
it was handed on to Mrs. Garland when it was not more than a fortnight
old. Whoever remembers anything about the old farmer-squire will, of
course, know well enough that this delightful privilege of reading
history in long columns was not accorded to the Widow Garland for
nothing. It was by such ingenuous means that he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>)
daughter's occasional services in reading aloud to him (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) and making out his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>)
accounts, in which matters the farmer, whose guineas were reported to
touch five figures--some said more--was not expert.

<p/>Mrs. Martha Garland, as a respectable widow, occupied a twilight rank
between the benighted villagers and the well-informed gentry, and kindly
made herself useful to the former as letter-writer and reader, and
general translator from the printing tongue. It was not without
satisfaction that she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) stood at her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) door of an evening, newspaper in hand,
with three or four cottagers standing round, and poured down their open
throats any paragraph that she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) might choose to select from the stirring
ones of the period. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) had done with the sheet Mrs. Garland passed
it on to the miller, the miller to the grinder, and the grinder to the
grinder's boy, in whose hands it became subdivided into half pages,
quarter pages, and irregular triangles, and ended its career as a paper
cap, a flagon bung, or a wrapper for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bread and cheese.

<p/>Notwithstanding his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) compact with Mrs. Garland, old Mr. Derriman kept the
paper so long, and was so chary of wasting his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) man's time on a merely
intellectual errand, that unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) sent for the journal it seldom
reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) hands. Anne was always her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) messenger. The arrival of the
soldiers led Mrs. Garland to despatch her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) daughter for it the day after
the party; and away she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) went in her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) hat and pelisse, in a direction at
right angles to that of the encampment on the hill.

<p/>Walking across the fields for the distance of a mile or two, she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) came out
upon the high-road by a wicket-gate. On the other side of the way was
the entrance to what at first sight looked like a neglected meadow, the
gate being a rotten one, without a bottom rail, and broken-down palings
lying on each side. The dry hard mud of the opening was marked with
several horse and cow tracks, that had been half obliterated by fifty
score sheep tracks, surcharged with the tracks of a man and a dog. Beyond
this geological record appeared a carriage-road, nearly grown over with
grass, which Anne followed. It descended by a gentle slope, dived under
dark-rinded elm and chestnut trees, and conducted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) on till the hiss of
a waterfall and the sound of the sea became audible, when it took a bend
round a swamp of fresh watercress and brooklime that had once been a fish
pond. Here the grey, weather-worn front of a building edged from behind
the trees. It was Oxwell Hall, once the seat of a family now extinct,
and of late years used as a farmhouse.

<p/>Benjamin Derriman, who owned the crumbling place, had originally been
only the occupier and tenant-farmer of the fields around. His (<font color='blue'><b>occupier</b></font>) wife had
brought him (<font color='blue'><b>occupier</b></font>) a small fortune, and during the growth of their only son
there had been a partition of the Oxwell estate, giving the farmer, now a
widower, the opportunity of acquiring the building and a small portion of
the land attached on exceptionally low terms. But two years after the
purchase the boy died, and Derriman's existence was paralyzed forthwith.
It was said that since that event he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) had devised the house and fields to
a distant female relative, to keep them out of the hands of his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) detested
nephew; but this was not certainly known.

<p/>The hall was as interesting as mansions in a state of declension usually
are, as the excellent county history showed. That popular work in folio
contained an old plate dedicated to the last scion of the original
owners, from which drawing it appeared that in 1750, the date of
publication, the windows were covered with little scratches like black
flashes of lightning; that a horn of hard smoke came out of each of the
twelve chimneys; that a lady and a lap-dog stood on the lawn in a
strenuously walking position; and a substantial cloud and nine flying
birds of no known species hung over the trees to the north-east.

<p/>The rambling and neglected dwelling had all the romantic excellencies and
practical drawbacks which such mildewed places share in common with
caves, mountains, wildernesses, glens, and other homes of poesy that
people of taste wish to live and die in. Mustard and cress could have
been raised on the inner plaster of the dewy walls at any height not
exceeding three feet from the floor; and mushrooms of the most refined
and thin-stemmed kinds grew up through the chinks of the larder paving.
As for the outside, Nature, in the ample time that had been given her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>),
had so mingled her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) filings and effacements with the marks of human wear
and tear upon the house, that it was often hard to say in which of the
two or if in both, any particular obliteration had its origin. The
keenness was gone from the mouldings of the doorways, but whether worn
out by the rubbing past of innumerable people's shoulders, and the moving
of their heavy furniture, or by Time in a grander and more abstract form,
did not appear. The iron stanchions inside the window-panes were eaten
away to the size of wires at the bottom where they entered the stone, the
condensed breathings of generations having settled there in pools and
rusted them. The panes themselves had either lost their shine altogether
or become iridescent as a peacock's tail. In the middle of the porch was
a vertical sun-dial, whose gnomon swayed loosely about when the wind
blew, and cast its shadow hither and thither, as much as to say, <div class="bookquote">``Here's
your fine model dial; here's any time for any man; I am an old dial; and
shiftiness is the best policy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne passed under the arched gateway which screened the main front; over
it was the porter's lodge, reached by a spiral staircase. Across the
archway was fixed a row of wooden hurdles, one of which Anne opened and
closed behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Their necessity was apparent as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) got
inside. The quadrangle of the ancient pile was a bed of mud and manure,
inhabited by calves, geese, ducks, and sow pigs surprisingly large, with
young ones surprisingly small. In the groined porch some heifers were
amusing themselves by stretching up their necks and licking the carved
stone capitals that supported the vaulting. Anne went on to a second and
open door, across which was another hurdle to keep the live stock from
absolute community with the inmates. There being no knocker, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knocked
by means of a short stick which was laid against the post for that
purpose; but nobody attending, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) entered the passage, and tried an
inner door.

<p/>A slight noise was heard inside, the door opened about an inch, and a
strip of decayed face, including the eye and some forehead wrinkles,
appeared within the crevice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please I have come for the paper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, is it you, dear Anne?''  (<font color='red'><b>the inmate</b></font>)</div>whined the inmate, opening the door a little
further. <div class="bookquote">``I could hardly get to the door to open it, I am so weak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The speaker</b></font>)</div><p/>The speaker was a wizened old gentleman, in a coat the colour of his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>)
farmyard, breeches of the same hue, unbuttoned at the knees, revealing a
bit of leg above his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) stocking and a dazzlingly white shirt-frill to
compensate for this untidiness below. The edge of his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) skull round his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>)
eye-sockets was visible through the skin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) had a mouth whose
corners made towards the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) head on the slightest provocation.
He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) walked with great apparent difficulty back into the room, Anne
following him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you can have the paper if you want it; but you never give me much
time to see what's in en! Here's the paper.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) held it out, but before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could take it he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) drew it back again, saying, ``I have not had my share

so soon for en. I am a poor put-upon soul; but my ``Duty of Man<div class="bookquote">'' will be
left to me when the newspaper is gone.''  (<font color='red'><b>Man</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) sank into his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) chair with
an air of exhaustion.

<p/>Anne said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not wish to take the paper if he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) had not done with
it, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was really later in the week than usual, owing to the
soldiers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Soldiers, yes--rot the soldiers! And now hedges will be broke, and
hens' nests robbed, and sucking-pigs stole, and I don't know what all.
Who's to pay for`t, sure? I reckon that because the soldiers be come you

myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would read if he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) wished, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was in no hurry. And sitting
herself down she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) unfolded the paper.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Dinner at Carlton House'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>?'

<p/>``No, faith. <div class="bookquote">``Tis nothing to I.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye may read that if ye will. I hope there will be no billeting in this

like myself do with soldiers in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) house, and nothing to feed 'em with?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne began reading, and continued at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) task nearly ten minutes, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was interrupted by the appearance in the quadrangular slough without
of a large figure in the uniform of the yeomanry cavalry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you see out there?''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>said the farmer with a start, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) paused
and slowly blushed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A soldier--one of the yeomanry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, not quite at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ease.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Scrounch it all--`tis my nephew!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man face</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the old man, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face
turning to a phosphoric pallor, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body twitching with innumerable
alarms as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) formed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face a gasping smile of joy, with which to
welcome the new-coming relative. <div class="bookquote">``Read on, prithee, Miss Garland.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had read far the visitor straddled over the door-hurdle into
the passage and entered the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, nunc, how do you feel?''  (<font color='red'><b>the giant</b></font>)</div>said the giant, shaking hands with the
farmer in the manner of one violently ringing a hand-bell. <div class="bookquote">``Glad to see
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bad and weakish, Festus,''  (<font color='red'><b>person</b></font>)</div>replied the other, his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) person responding
passively to the rapid vibrations imparted. <div class="bookquote">``O, be tender, please--a

his (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) uncle's chair with a loud smack, at which Uncle Benjy nervously
sprang three inches from his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) seat and dropped into it again. ``Ask your
pardon for frightening ye, uncle. <div class="bookquote">``Tis how we do in the army, and I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to see ye. You are not going to stay long, perhaps?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite the contrary. I am going to stay ever so long!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O I see! I am so glad, dear Festus. Ever so long, did ye say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, _ever_ so long,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the young gentleman, sitting on the slope of
the bureau and stretching out his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) legs as props. <div class="bookquote">``I am going to make
this quite my own home whenever I am off duty, as long as we stay out.
And after that, when the campaign is over in the autumn, I shall come

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! How you do please me!''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>said the farmer, with a horrified smile, and
grasping the arms of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) chair to sustain himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I have been meaning to come a long time, as I knew you'd like to
have me, Uncle Benjy; and `tisn't in my heart to refuse you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You always was kind that way!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I always was. But I ought to tell you at once, not to disappoint

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, not always? That's a pity!''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the farmer with a cheerful
eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew you'd say so. And I shan't be able to sleep here at night
sometimes, for the same reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not sleep here o' nights?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman, still more relieved.
``You ought to sleep here--you certainly ought; in short, you must. But

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not while we are with the colours. But directly that's over--the very

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Th-thank ye, that will be very nice!''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Benjy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I knew `twould relieve ye.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) kindly stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) uncle's
head, the old man expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) enjoyment at the affectionate token by a
death's-head grimace. <div class="bookquote">``I should have called to see you the other night
when I passed through here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>Festus continued; `but it was so late that I

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, if you _couldn't_. I never shall think it unkind if you
really _can't_ come, you know, Festy.''  (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div>There was a few minutes' pause,
and as the nephew said nothing Uncle Benjy went on: <div class="bookquote">``I wish I had a
little present for ye. But as ill-luck would have it we have lost a deal
of stock this year, and I have had to pay away so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Benjy/Uncle Benjy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor old man--I know you have. Shall I lend you a seven-shilling piece,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha, ha!--you must have your joke; well, I'll think o' that. And so they

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who says so?''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>asked the florid son of Mars, losing a little redness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The newspaper-man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, there's nothing in that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus bravely. <div class="bookquote">``The gover`ment
thought it possible at one time; but they don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div><p/>Festus turned himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) talked, and now said abruptly: <div class="bookquote">``Ah, who's
this? Why, `tis our little Anne!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) had not noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) till this
moment, the young woman having at his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) entry kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) face over the
newspaper, and then got away to the back part of the room. <div class="bookquote">``And are you
and your mother always going to stay down there in the mill-house
watching the little fishes, Miss Anne?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) said that it was uncertain, in a tone of truthful precision which the
question was hardly worth, looking forcedly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) spoke. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)
blushed fitfully, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) arms and hands as much as in her (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) face. Not that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) was overpowered by the great boots, formidable spurs, and other
fierce appliances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) person, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) imagined; simply she (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) had not been
prepared to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you will, I am sure, for my own good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>), letting his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) eyes
linger on the round of her (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) cheek.

<p/>Anne became a little more dignified, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) look showed reserve. But
the yeoman on perceiving this went on talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in so civil a way
that he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) irresistibly amused her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tried to conceal all feeling.
At a brighter remark of his (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) than usual her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mouth moved, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) upper lip
playing uncertainly over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) white teeth; it would stay still--no, it
would withdraw a little way in a smile; then it would flutter down again;
and so it wavered like a butterfly in a tender desire to be pleased and
smiling, and yet to be also sedate and composed; to show him (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did
not want compliments, and yet that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was not so cold as to wish to
repress any genuine feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) might be anxious to utter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you want any more reading, Mr. Derriman?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), interrupting
the younger man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remarks. <div class="bookquote">``If not, I'll go homeward.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let me hinder you longer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus. <div class="bookquote">``I'm off in a minute or
two, when your man has cleaned my boots.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye don't hinder us, nephew. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must have the paper: `tis the day for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to have `n. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) might read a little more, as I have had so little
profit out o' en hitherto. Well, why don't ye speak? Will ye, or won't
ye, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to two,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ho, ho! damn it, I must go then, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus, laughing; and
unable to get a further glance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) left the room and clanked into
the back yard, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) saw a man; holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``Anthony
Cripplestraw!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Cripplestraw came up in a trot, moved a lock of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) hair and replaced it,
and said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Maister Derriman.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cripplestraw/Anthony Cripplestraw/Anthony</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) was old Mr. Derriman's odd hand in
the yard and garden, and like his (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) employer had no great pretensions to
manly beauty, owing to a limpness of backbone and speciality of mouth,
which opened on one side only, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) a triangular smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Cripplestraw, how is it to-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus, with
socially-superior heartiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Middlin', considering, Maister Derriman. And how's yerself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fairish. Well, now, see and clean these military boots of mine. I'll
cock my foot up on this bench. This pigsty of my uncle's is not fit for
a soldier to come into.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Maister Derriman, I will. No, `tis not fit, Maister Derriman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What stock has uncle lost this year, Cripplestraw?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let's see, sir. I can call to mind that we've lost three
chickens, a tom-pigeon, and a weakly sucking-pig, one of a fare of ten. I
can't think of no more, Maister Derriman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm, not a large quantity of cattle. The old rascal!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, `tis not a large quantity. Old what did you say, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>)'s within there.''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>Festus flung his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) forehead in the
direction of a right line towards the inner apartment. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>)'s a regular

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hee, hee; fie, fie, Master Derriman!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cripplestraw/Anthony Cripplestraw/Anthony</b></font>)</div>said Cripplestraw, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>)

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes, sir; they do off and on, you know. They says you be as fine
a piece of calvery flesh and bones as was ever growed on fallow-ground;

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey?''  (<font color='red'><b>the warrior</b></font>)</div>said the warrior uneasily. <div class="bookquote">``What makes 'em think I am going to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, maister, I am afraid I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cripplestraw/Anthony Cripplestraw/Anthony</b></font>)</div>said the cheering Cripplestraw. ``And

 (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div><p/>Festus gloomily returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) uncle's room and found that Anne was just
leaving. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) was inclined to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) at once, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) no
opportunity for doing this he (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) went to the window, and remained tapping
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) fingers against the shutter while she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) crossed the yard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, nephy, you are not gone yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>said the farmer, looking dubiously
at Festus from under one eyelid. <div class="bookquote">``You see how I am. Not by any means

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't, nunc, you can't. I don't think you are worse--if I do, dash

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis, Festus; and I am thinking of moving.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, where to?''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus, with surprise and interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Up into the garret in the north corner. There is no fireplace in the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis not moving far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis not. But I have not a soul belonging to me within ten mile; and

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A splendid spirit!''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Benjy, with much admiration on the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be disturbed, uncle; I'll control myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus, betrayed

assurance, each yard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) retreat adding private joyousness to his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)
uncle's form.

<p/>When the bulky young man had disappeared through the porter's lodge,
Uncle Benjy showed preternatural activity for one in his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) invalid state,
jumping up quickly without his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) stick, at the same time opening and
shutting his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) mouth quite silently like a thirsty frog, which was his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) way
of expressing mirth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) ran upstairs as quick as an old squirrel, and
went to a dormer window which commanded a view of the grounds beyond the
gate, and the footpath that stretched across them to the village.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) said in a suppressed scream, dancing up and down, `he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>)'s
after her (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>)'ve hit en!'' For there appeared upon the path the figure
of Anne Garland, and, hastening on at some little distance behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>),
the swaggering shape of Festus. She (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) became conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) approach,
and moved more quickly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) moved more quickly still, and overtook her (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) turned as if in answer to a call from him (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) walked on beside
her (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>), till they were out of sight. The old man then played upon an
imaginary fiddle for about half a minute; and, suddenly discontinuing
these signs of pleasure, went downstairs again.




<p/>VII. HOW THEY TALKED IN THE PASTURES


<p/><div class="bookquote">``You often come this way?''  (<font color='red'><b>HOW THEY</b></font>)</div>said Festus to Anne rather before he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) had
overtaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I come for the newspaper and other things,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, perplexed by a
doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) were there by accident or design.

<p/>They moved on in silence, Festus beating the grass with his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) switch in a
masterful way. <div class="bookquote">``Did you speak, Mis`ess Anne?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten thousand pardons. I thought you did. Now don't let me drive you
out of the path. I can walk among the high grass and giltycups--they
will not yellow my stockings as they will yours. Well, what do you think
of a lot of soldiers coming to the neighbourhood in this way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it is very lively, and a great change,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said with demure
seriousness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you don't like us warriors as a body?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne smiled without replying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you are laughing!''  (<font color='red'><b>the yeoman</b></font>)</div>said the yeoman, looking searchingly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and
blushing like a little fire. <div class="bookquote">``What do you see to laugh at?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I laugh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, a little scared at his (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) sudden mortification.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, yes; you know you did, you young sneerer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) said like a cross
baby. <div class="bookquote">``You are laughing at me--that's who you are laughing at! I should
like to know what you would do without such as me if the French were to
drop in upon ye any night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you help to beat them off?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you ask such a question? What are we for? But you don't think
anything of soldiers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>O yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) liked soldiers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, especially when they came home from
the wars, covered with glory; though when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thought what doings had won
them that glory she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not like them quite so well. The gallant and
appeased yeoman said he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) supposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to mean chopping off heads, blowing
out brains, and that kind of business, and thought it quite right that a
tender-hearted thing like her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) should feel a little horrified. But as for
him (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) should not mind such another Blenheim this summer as the army had
fought a hundred years ago, or whenever it was--dash his (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) wig if he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) should
mind it at all. <div class="bookquote">``Hullo! now you are laughing again; yes, I saw you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>And
the choleric Festus turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) blue eyes and flushed face upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) as
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) would read her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) through. Anne strove valiantly to look calmly
back; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes could not face his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>), and they fell. <div class="bookquote">``You did laugh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was only a tiny little one,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--I knew you did!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thundered he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Now what was it you laughed at?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only--thought that you were--merely in the yeomanry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) murmured
slily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what of that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the yeomanry only seem farmers that have lost their senses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes! I knew you meant some jeering o' that sort, Mistress Anne.
But I suppose `tis the way of women, and I take no notice. I'll confess
that some of us are no great things: but I know how to draw a sword,
don't I?--say I don't just to provoke me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne sweetly. <div class="bookquote">``If a Frenchman came up to you,
Mr. Derriman, would you take him (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) on the hip, or on the thigh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you are flattering!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) said, his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) white teeth uncovering themselves
in a smile. ``Well, of course I should draw my sword--no, I mean my sword
would be already drawn; and I should put spurs to my horse--charger, as
we call it in the army; and I should ride up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) and say--no, I
shouldn't say anything, of course--men never waste words in battle; I
should take him (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) with the third guard, low point, and then coming back to
the second guard--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But that would be taking care of yourself--not hitting at him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you say that!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) cried, the beams upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) face turning to a
lurid cloud in a moment. <div class="bookquote">``How can you understand military terms who've
never had a sword in your life? I shouldn't take him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) with the sword at
all.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) went on with eager sulkiness, ``I should take him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) with my
pistol. I should pull off my right glove, and throw back my goat-skin;
then I should open my priming-pan, prime, and cast about--no, I
shouldn't, that's wrong; I should draw my right pistol, and as soon as
loaded, seize the weapon by the butt; then at the word <div class="bookquote">``Cock your pistol''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>I should--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then there is plenty of time to give such words of command in the heat
of battle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne innocently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>the yeoman face</b></font>)</div>said the yeoman, his (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) face again in flames. ``Why, of course I am
only telling you what _would_ be the word of command _if_--there now! you
la--'

<p/>``I didn't; `pon my word I didn<div class="bookquote">``t!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't think you did; it was my mistake. Well, then I come smartly
to Present, looking well along the barrel--along the barrel--and fire. Of
course I know well enough how to engage the enemy! But I expect my old
uncle has been setting you against me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) has not said a word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>replied Anne; `though I have heard of you, of
course.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you heard? Nothing good, I dare say. It makes my blood boil
within me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, nothing bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) assuringly. <div class="bookquote">``Just a word now and then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, come, tell me, there's a dear. I don't like to be crossed. It
shall be a sacred secret between us. Come, now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne was embarrassed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) smile was uncomfortable. <div class="bookquote">``I shall not tell
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There it is again!''  (<font color='red'><b>the yeoman</b></font>)</div>said the yeoman, throwing himself into a despair. <div class="bookquote">``I
shall soon begin to believe that my name is not worth sixpence about
here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you 'twas nothing against you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>repeated Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That means it might have been for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus, in a mollified tone.
``Well, though, to speak the truth, I have a good many faults, some people
will praise me, I suppose. <div class="bookquote">``Twas praise?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am not much at farming, and I am not much in company, and I am
not much at figures, but perhaps I must own, since it is forced upon me,
that I can show as fine a soldier's figure on the Esplanade as any man of
the cavalry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne; for though her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) flesh crept in mortal terror of his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)
irascibility, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not resist the fearful pleasure of leading him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)
on. ``You look very well; and some say, you are--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What? Well, they say I am good-looking. I don't make myself, so `tis
no praise. Hullo! what are you looking across there for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only at a bird that I saw fly out of that tree,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What? Only at a bird, do you say?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) heaved out in a voice of thunder.
<div class="bookquote">``I see your shoulders a-shaking, young madam. Now don't you provoke me
with that laughing! By God, it won't do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then go away!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, changed from mirthfulness to irritation by his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)
rough manner. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want your company, you great bragging thing! You
are so touchy there's no bearing with you. Go away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, Anne; I am wrong to speak to you so. I give you free liberty to
say what you will to me. Say I am not a bit of a soldier, or anything!
Abuse me--do now, there's a dear. I'm scum, I'm froth, I'm dirt before
the besom--yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have nothing to say, sir. Stay where you are till I am out of this
field.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there's such command in your looks that I ha'n't heart to go
against you. You will come this way to-morrow at the same time? Now,
don't be uncivil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was too generous not to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>), but the short little lip
murmured that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not think it at all likely she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) should come that way
to-morrow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then Sunday?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not Sunday,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then Monday--Tuesday--Wednesday, surely?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) went on experimentally.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) answered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) should probably not see him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) on either day, and,
cutting short the argument, went through the wicket into the other field.
Festus paused, looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>); and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) could no longer see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
slight figure he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) swept away his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) deliberations, began singing, and turned
off in the other direction.




<p/>VIII. ANNE MAKES A CIRCUIT OF THE CAMP


<p/>When Anne was crossing the last field, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw approaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) an old
woman with wrinkled cheeks, who surveyed the earth and its inhabitants
through the medium of brass-rimmed spectacles. Shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head at Anne
till the glasses shone like two moons, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, ah; I zeed ye! If
I had only kept on my short ones that I use for reading the Collect and
Gospel I shouldn't have zeed ye; but thinks I, I be going out o' doors,
and I'll put on my long ones, little thinking what they'd show me. Ay, I
can tell folk at any distance with these--`tis a beautiful pair for out
o' doors; though my short ones be best for close work, such as darning,
and catching fleas, that's true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you seen, Granny Seamore?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fie, fie, Miss Nancy! you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Granny Seamore</b></font>)</div>said Granny Seamore, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head
still. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s a fine young feller, and will have all his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) uncle's
money when `a's gone.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>Anne said nothing to this, and looking ahead with
a smile passed Granny Seamore by.

<p/>Festus, the subject of the remark, was at this time about
three-and-twenty, a fine fellow as to feet and inches, and of a
remarkably warm tone in skin and hair. Symptoms of beard and whiskers
had appeared upon him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) at a very early age, owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) persistent use of
the razor before there was any necessity for its operation. The brave
boy had scraped unseen in the out-house, in the cellar, in the wood-shed,
in the stable, in the unused parlour, in the cow-stalls, in the barn, and
wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could set up his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) triangular bit of looking-glass without
observation, or extemporize a mirror by sticking up his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hat on the
outside of a window-pane. The result now was that, did he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) neglect to use
the instrument he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) once had trifled with, a fine rust broke out upon his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
countenance on the first day, a golden lichen on the second, and a fiery
stubble on the third to a degree which admitted of no further
postponement.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) disposition divided naturally into two, the boastful and the
cantankerous. When Festus put on the big pot, as it is classically
called, he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) was quite blinded ipso facto to the diverting effect of that
mood and manner upon others; but when disposed to be envious or
quarrelsome he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) was rather shrewd than otherwise, and could do some pretty
strokes of satire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) was both liked and abused by the girls who knew
him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>), and though they were pleased by his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) attentions, they never failed to
ridicule him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) back. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) cups -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) knew those vessels, though
only twenty-three-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) first became noisy, then excessively friendly, and
then invariably nagging. During childhood he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) had made himself renowned
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) pleasant habit of pouncing down upon boys smaller and poorer than
himself, and knocking their birds' nests out of their hands, or
overturning their little carts of apples, or pouring water down their
backs; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) conduct became singularly the reverse of aggressive the
moment the little boys' mothers ran out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>), brandishing brooms,
frying-pans, skimmers, and whatever else they could lay hands on by way
of weapons. He (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) then fled and hid behind bushes, under faggots, or in
pits till they had gone away; and on one such occasion was known to creep
into a badger's hole quite out of sight, maintaining that post with great
firmness and resolution for two or three hours. He (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) had brought more
vulgar exclamations upon the tongues of respectable parents in his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) native
parish than any other boy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) time. When other youngsters snowballed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) ran into a place of shelter, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) kneaded snowballs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)
own, with a stone inside, and used these formidable missiles in returning
their pleasantry. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) got fearfully beaten by boys his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) own age,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) would roar most lustily, but fight on in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) tears,
blood, and cries.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) was early in love, and had at the time of the story suffered from the
ravages of that passion thirteen distinct times. He (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) could not love
lightly and gaily; his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) love was earnest, cross-tempered, and even savage.
It was a positive agony to him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) to be ridiculed by the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)
affections, and such conduct drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) into a frenzy if persisted in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)
was a torment to those who behaved humbly towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>), cynical with those
who denied his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) superiority, and a very nice fellow towards those who had
the courage to ill-use him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>).

<p/>This stalwart gentleman and Anne Garland did not cross each other's paths
again for a week. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) mother began as before about the newspaper,
and, though Anne did not much like the errand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) agreed to go for it on
Mrs. Garland pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) with unusual anxiety. Why her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) mother was so
persistent on so small a matter quite puzzled the girl; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) put on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) hat and started.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) had expected, Festus appeared at a stile over which she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) sometimes
went for shortness' sake, and showed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) manner that he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>).
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) saw this she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) kept straight on, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) would not enter the
park at all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely this is your way?''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was thinking of going round by the road,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) paused, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) were not inclined to say. <div class="bookquote">``I go that way when the
grass is wet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) returned at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not wet now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) persisted; `the sun has been shining on it these
nine hours.'' The fact was that the way by the path was less open than by
the road, and Festus wished to walk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) uninterrupted. <div class="bookquote">``But, of
course, it is nothing to me what you do.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) flung himself from the
stile and walked away towards the house.

<p/>Anne, supposing him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) really indifferent, took the same way, upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)
turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) head and waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) with a proud smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot go with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said decisively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, you foolish girl! I must walk along with you down to the
corner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, please, Mr. Derriman; we might be seen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, now--that's shyness!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) said jocosely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; you know I cannot let you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I must.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do not allow it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Allow it or not, I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you are unkind, and I must submit,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes brimming
with tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ho, ho; what a shame of me! My wig, I won't do any such thing for the
world,''  (<font color='red'><b>the yeoman</b></font>)</div>said the repentant yeoman. ``Haw, haw; why, I thought your ``go
away'' meant ``come on,<div class="bookquote">'' as it does with so many of the women I meet,
especially in these clothes. Who was to know you were so confoundedly
serious?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) did not go Anne stood still and said nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see you have a deal more caution and a deal less good-nature than I
ever thought you had,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) continued emphatically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir; it is not any planned manner of mine at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said
earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``But you will see, I am sure, that I could not go down to the
hall with you without putting myself in a wrong light.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; that's it, that's it. I am only a fellow in the yeomanry cavalry--a
plain soldier, I may say; and we know what women think of such: that they
are a bad lot--men you mustn't speak to for fear of losing your
character--chaps you avoid in the roads--chaps that come into a house
like oxen, daub the stairs wi' their boots, stain the furniture wi' their
drink, talk rubbish to the servants, abuse all that's holy and righteous,
and are only saved from being carried off by Old Nick because they are
wanted for Boney.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, I didn't know you were thought so bad of as that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
simply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! don't my uncle complain to you of me? You are a favourite of that
handsome, nice old gaffer's, I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what do we think of our nice trumpet-major, hey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mouth up tight, built it up, in fact, to show that no
answer was coming to that question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O now, come, seriously, Loveday is a good fellow, and so is his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``What a close little rogue you are! There is no getting anything out of
you. I believe you would say ``I don't know,'' to every mortal question,
so very discreet as you are. Upon my heart, there are some women who
would say ``I don't know,'' to <div class="bookquote">``Will ye marry me?'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>The brightness upon Anne's cheek and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes during this remark
showed that there was a fair quantity of life and warmth beneath the
discretion he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) complained of. Having spoken thus, he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) drew aside that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
might pass, and bowed very low. Anne formally inclined herself and went
on.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been at vexation point all the time that he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) was present, from a
haunting sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) would not have spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) so freely had she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
been a young woman with thriving male relatives to keep forward admirers
in check. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been struck, now as at their previous meeting,
with the power she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) possessed of working him (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) up either to irritation or to
complacency at will; and this consciousness of being able to play upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) as upon an instrument disposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to a humorous considerateness, and
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tolerate even while she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) rebuffed him (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>).

<p/>When Anne got to the hall the farmer, as usual, insisted upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) reading
what he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had been unable to get through, and held the paper tightly in his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)
skinny hand till she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had agreed. He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to a hard chair that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
could not possibly injure to the extent of a pennyworth by sitting in it
a twelvemonth, and watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) from the outer angle of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) near eye while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) bent over the paper. His (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) look might have been suggested by the sight
that he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had witnessed from his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) window on the last occasion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) visit,
for it partook of the nature of concern. The old man was afraid of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
nephew, physically and morally, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to regard Anne as a fellow-
sufferer under the same despot. After this sly and curious gaze at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) withdrew his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye again, so that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) casually lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own there
was nothing visible but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) keen bluish profile as before.

<p/>When the reading was about half-way through, the door behind them opened,
and footsteps crossed the threshold. The farmer diminished perceptibly
in his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) chair, and looked fearful, but pretended to be absorbed in the
reading, and quite unconscious of an intruder. Anne felt the presence of
the swashing Festus, and stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) reading.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please go on, Miss Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am not going to speak a word.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)
withdrew to the mantelpiece and leaned against it at his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) ease.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on, do ye, maidy Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Benjy/Uncle Benjy</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Benjy, keeping down his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) tremblings
by a great effort to half their natural extent.

<p/>Anne's voice became much lower now that there were two listeners, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
modesty shrank somewhat from exposing to Festus the appreciative
modulations which an intelligent interest in the subject drew from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
when unembarrassed. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) still went on that he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) might not suppose her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
to be disconcerted, though the ensuing ten minutes was one of
disquietude. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew that the bothering yeoman's eyes were travelling
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) position behind, creeping over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) shoulders, up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
head, and across her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) arms and hands. Old Benjy on his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) part knew the same
thing, and after sundry endeavours to peep at his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) nephew from the corner
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) eye, he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) could bear the situation no longer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do ye want to say anything to me, nephew?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) quaked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, uncle, thank ye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus heartily. <div class="bookquote">``I like to stay here,
thinking of you and looking at your back hair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The nervous old man writhed under this vivisection, and Anne read on;
till, to the relief of both, the gallant fellow grew tired of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
amusement and went out of the room. Anne soon finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) paragraph and
rose to go, determined never to come again as long as Festus haunted the
precincts. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face grew warmer as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) would be sure to
waylay her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) journey home to-day.

<p/>On this account, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) left the house, instead of going in the
customary direction, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) bolted round to the further side, through the
bushes, along under the kitchen-garden wall, and through a door leading
into a rutted cart-track, which had been a pleasant gravelled drive when
the fine old hall was in its prosperity. Once out of sight of the
windows she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ran with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) might till she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had quitted the park by a
route directly opposite to that towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) home. Why she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was so
seriously bent upon doing this she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could hardly tell but the instinct to
run was irresistible.

<p/>It was necessary now to clamber over the down to the left of the camp,
and make a complete circuit round the latter--infantry, cavalry, sutlers,
and all--descending to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) house on the other side. This tremendous walk
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) performed at a rapid rate, never once turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head, and avoiding
every beaten track to keep clear of the knots of soldiers taking a walk.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) at last got down to the levels again she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) paused to fetch breath,
and murmured, <div class="bookquote">``Why did I take so much trouble? He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) would not, after all,
have hurt me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) neared the mill an erect figure with a blue body and white thighs
descended before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) from the down towards the village, and went past the
mill to a stile beyond, over which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) usually returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) house.
Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lingered. On coming nearer Anne discovered this person to be
Trumpet-major Loveday; and not wishing to meet anybody just now Anne
passed quickly on, and entered the house by the garden door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Anne, what a time you have been gone!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have been round by another road.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you do that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne looked thoughtful and reticent, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) reason was almost too silly
a one to confess. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I wanted to avoid a person who is very busy
trying to meet me--that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother glanced out of the window. <div class="bookquote">``And there he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
said, as John Loveday, tired of looking for Anne at the stile, passed the
house on his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) father's door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) could not help casting his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
eyes towards their window, and, seeing them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) smiled.

<p/>Anne's reluctance to mention Festus was such that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not correct her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
mother's error, and the dame went on: <div class="bookquote">``Well, you are quite right, my
dear. Be friendly with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), but no more at present. I have heard of
your other affair, and think it is a very wise choice. I am sure you
have my best wishes in it, and I only hope it will come to a point.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the dame</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said the astonished Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You and Mr. Festus Derriman, dear. You need not mind me; I have known
it for several days. Old Granny Seamore called here Saturday, and told
me she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) coming home with you across Park Close last week, when you
went for the newspaper; so I thought I'd send you again to-day, and give
you another chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you didn't want the paper--and it was only for that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>)'s a very fine young fellow; he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) looks a thorough woman's protector.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) may look it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) has given up the freehold farm his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) father held at Pitstock, and lives
in independence on what the land brings him (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>). And when Farmer Derriman
dies, he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>)'ll have all the old man's, for certain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>)'ll be worth ten
thousand pounds, if a penny, in money, besides sixteen horses, cart and
hack, a fifty-cow dairy, and at least five hundred sheep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne turned away, and instead of informing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been
running like a doe to escape the interesting heir-presumptive alluded to,
merely said <div class="bookquote">``Mother, I don't like this at all.''




 (<font color='red'><b>a doe</b></font>)</div><p/>IX. ANNE IS KINDLY FETCHED BY THE TRUMPET-MAJOR


<p/>After this, Anne would on no account walk in the direction of the hall
for fear of another encounter with young Derriman. In the course of a
few days it was told in the village that the old farmer had actually gone
for a week's holiday and change of air to the Royal watering-place near
at hand, at the instance of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) nephew Festus. This was a wonderful
thing to hear of Uncle Benjy, who had not slept outside the walls of
Oxwell Hall for many a long year before; and Anne well imagined what
extraordinary pressure must have been put upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) to induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) to take
such a step. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) pictured his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) unhappiness at the bustling
watering-place, and hoped no harm would come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) spent much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) time indoors or in the garden, hearing little of
the camp movements beyond the periodical Ta-ta-ta-taa of the trumpeters
sounding their various ingenious calls for watch-setting, stables, feed,
boot-and-saddle, parade, and so on, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) think how clever her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
friend the trumpet-major must be to teach his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pupils to play those pretty
little tunes so well.

<p/>On the third morning after Uncle Benjy's departure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was disturbed as
usual while dressing by the tramp of the troops down the slope to the
mill-pond, and during the now familiar stamping and splashing which
followed there sounded upon the glass of the window a slight smack, which
might have been caused by a whip or switch. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) listened more
particularly, and it was repeated.

<p/>As John Loveday was the only dragoon likely to be aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) slept in
that particular apartment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) imagined the signal to come from him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>),
though wondering that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) should venture upon such a freak of familiarity.

<p/>Wrapping herself up in a red cloak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went to the window, gently drew
up a corner of the curtain, and peeped out, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had done many times
before. Nobody who was not quite close beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) window could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
face; but as it happened, somebody was close. The soldiers whose
floundering Anne had heard were not Loveday's dragoons, but a troop of
the York Hussars, quite oblivious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) existence. They had passed on
out of the water, and instead of them there sat Festus Derriman alone on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) horse, and in plain clothes, the water reaching up to the animal's
belly, and Festus' heels elevated over the saddle to keep them out of the
stream, which threatened to wash rider and horse into the deep mill-head
just below. It was plainly he (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) who had struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lattice, for in a
moment he (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) looked up, and their eyes met. Festus laughed loudly, and
slapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) window again; and just at that moment the dragoons began
prancing down the slope in review order. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not but wait a minute
or two to see them pass. While doing so she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was suddenly led to draw
back, drop the corner of the curtain, and blush privately in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) room.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had not only been seen by Festus Derriman, but by John Loveday, who,
riding along with his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) trumpet slung up behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>), had looked over his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
shoulder at the phenomenon of Derriman beneath Anne's bedroom window and
seemed quite astounded at the sight.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was quite vexed at the conjunction of incidents, and went no more to
the window till the dragoons had ridden far away and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had heard
Festus's horse laboriously wade on to dry land. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) looked out
there was nobody left but Miller Loveday, who usually stood in the garden
at this time of the morning to say a word or two to the soldiers, of whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) already knew so many, and was in a fair way of knowing many more, from
the liberality with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) handed round mugs of cheering liquor
whenever parties of them walked that way.

<p/>In the afternoon of this day Anne walked to a christening party at a
neighbour's in the adjoining parish of Springham, intending to walk home
again before it got dark; but there was a slight fall of rain towards
evening, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was pressed by the people of the house to stay over the
night. With some hesitation she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) accepted their hospitality; but at ten
o'clock, when they were thinking of going to bed, they were startled by a
smart rap at the door, and on it being unbolted a man's form was seen in
the shadows outside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Miss Garland here?''  (<font color='red'><b>the visitor</b></font>)</div>the visitor inquired, at which Anne suspended her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne's entertainer, warily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) mother is very anxious to know what's become of her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) promised
to come home.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>To her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) great relief Anne recognized the voice as John
Loveday's, and not Festus Derriman's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did, Mr. Loveday,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), coming forward; `but it rained, and
I thought my mother would guess where I was.''

<p/>Loveday said with diffidence that it had not rained anything to speak of
at the camp, or at the mill, so that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother was rather alarmed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) asked you to come for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>Anne inquired.

<p/>This was a question which the trumpet-major had been dreading during the
whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) walk thither. <div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) didn't exactly ask me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) said
rather lamely, but still in a manner to show that Mrs. Garland had
indirectly signified such to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) wish. In reality Mrs. Garland had
not addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) at all on the subject. She (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) had merely spoken to his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
father on finding that her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) daughter did not return, and received an
assurance from the miller that the precious girl was doubtless quite
safe. John heard of this inquiry, and, having a pass that evening,
resolved to relieve Mrs. Garland's mind on his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own responsibility. Ever
since his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) morning view of Festus under her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) window he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had been on thorns
of anxiety, and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) thrilling hope now was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) would walk back with
him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) foot nervously as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) made the bold request. Anne felt at
once that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would go. There was nobody in the world whose care she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
would more readily be under than the trumpet-major's in a case like the
present. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was their nearest neighbour's son, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had liked his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
single-minded ingenuousness from the first moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) return home.

<p/>When they had started on their walk, Anne said in a practical way, to
show that there was no sentiment whatever in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) acceptance of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
company, <div class="bookquote">``Mother was much alarmed about me, perhaps?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) was uneasy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said; and then was compelled by conscience to
make a clean breast of it. <div class="bookquote">``I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) was uneasy, because my father
said so. But I did not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) myself. The truth is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) doesn't know I
am come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne now saw how the matter stood; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was not offended with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).
What woman could have been? They walked on in silence, the respectful
trumpet-major keeping a yard off on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) right as precisely as if that
measure had been fixed between them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had a great feeling of civility
toward him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) this evening, and spoke again. <div class="bookquote">``I often hear your trumpeters
blowing the calls. They do it beautifully, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty fair; they might do better,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), as one too well-mannered to
make much of an accomplishment in which he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had a hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you taught them how to do it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I taught them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It must require wonderful practice to get them into the way of beginning
and finishing so exactly at one time. It is like one throat doing it
all. How came you to be a trumpeter, Mr. Loveday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I took to it naturally when I was a little boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), betrayed
into quite a gushing state by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) delightful interest. <div class="bookquote">``I used to make
trumpets of paper, eldersticks, eltrot stems, and even stinging-nettle
stalks, you know. Then father set me to keep the birds off that little
barley-ground of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and gave me an old horn to frighten 'em with. I
learnt to blow that horn so that you could hear me for miles and miles.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bought me a clarionet, and when I could play that I borrowed a
serpent, and I learned to play a tolerable bass. So when I `listed I was
picked out for training as trumpeter at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes, however, I wish I had never joined the army. My father gave
me a very fair education, and your father showed me how to draw horses--on
a slate, I mean. Yes, I ought to have done more than I have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, did you know my father?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) asked with new interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes, for years. You were a little mite of a thing then; and you used
to cry when we big boys looked at you, and made pig's eyes at you, which
we did sometimes. Many and many a time have I stood by your poor father
while he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) worked. Ah, you don't remember much about him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); but I do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne remained thoughtful; and the moon broke from behind the clouds,
lighting up the wet foliage with a twinkling brightness, and lending to
each of the trumpet-major's buttons and spurs a little ray of its own.
They had come to Oxwell park gate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Do you like going
across, or round by the lane?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We may as well go by the nearest road,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/>They entered the park, following the half-obliterated drive till they
came almost opposite the hall, when they entered a footpath leading on to
the village. While hereabout they heard a shout, or chorus of
exclamation, apparently from within the walls of the dark buildings near
them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) companion. <div class="bookquote">``I'll go and see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) went round the intervening swamp of watercress and brooklime which had
once been the fish-pond, crossed by a culvert the trickling brook that
still flowed that way, and advanced to the wall of the house. Boisterous
noises were resounding from within, and he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was tempted to go round the
corner, where the low windows were, and look through a chink into the
room whence the sounds proceeded.

<p/>It was the room in which the owner dined--traditionally called the great
parlour--and within it sat about a dozen young men of the yeomanry
cavalry, one of them being Festus. They were drinking, laughing,
singing, thumping their fists on the tables, and enjoying themselves in
the very perfection of confusion. The candles, blown by the breeze from
the partly opened window, had guttered into coffin handles and shrouds,
and, choked by their long black wicks for want of snuffing, gave out a
smoky yellow light. One of the young men might possibly have been in a
maudlin state, for he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) arm round the neck of his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) next neighbour.
Another was making an incoherent speech to which nobody was listening.
Some of their faces were red, some were sallow; some were sleepy, some
wide awake. The only one among them who appeared in his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) usual frame of
mind was Festus, whose huge, burly form rose at the head of the table,
enjoying with a serene and triumphant aspect the difference between his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)
own condition and that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) neighbours. While the trumpet-major
looked, a young woman, niece of Anthony Cripplestraw, and one of Uncle
Benjy's servants, was called in by one of the crew, and much against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
will a fiddle was placed in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands, from which they made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) produce
discordant screeches.

<p/>The absence of Uncle Benjy had, in fact, been contrived by young Derriman
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) might make use of the hall on his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) own account. Cripplestraw had
been left in charge, and Festus had found no difficulty in forcing from
that dependent the keys of whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) required. John Loveday turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
eyes from the scene to the neighbouring moonlit path, where Anne still
stood waiting. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) looked into the room, then at Anne again. It was
an opportunity of advancing his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) own cause with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) by exposing Festus,
for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) began to entertain hostile feelings of no mean force.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I can't do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">''`Tis underhand. Let things take their
chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) moved away, and then perceived that Anne, tired of waiting, had
crossed the stream, and almost come up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the noise about?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's company in the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Loveday.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Company? Farmer Derriman is not at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, and went on to the
window whence the rays of light leaked out, the trumpet-major standing
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face enter the beam of candlelight, stay there
for a moment, and quickly withdraw. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) at once. <div class="bookquote">``Let
us go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said.

<p/>Loveday imagined from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tone that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must have an interest in
Derriman, and said sadly, <div class="bookquote">``You blame me for going across to the window,
and leading you to follow me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) mistake as to the state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heart,
and being rather angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) for it. <div class="bookquote">``I think it was most natural,
considering the noise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Silence again. <div class="bookquote">``Derriman is sober as a judge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Loveday, as they
turned to go. <div class="bookquote">``It was only the others who were noisy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) is sober or not is nothing whatever to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not. I know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the trumpet-major, in accents
expressing unhappiness at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) somewhat curt tone, and some doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
assurance.

<p/>Before they had emerged from the shadow of the hall some persons were
seen moving along the road. Loveday was for going on just the same; but
Anne, from a shy feeling that it was as well not to be seen walking alone
with a man who was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lover, said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Loveday, let us wait here a minute till they have passed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lover</b></font>)</div><p/>On nearer view the group was seen to comprise a man on a piebald horse,
and another man walking beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). When they were opposite the house
they halted, and the rider dismounted, whereupon a dispute between him (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>)
and the other man ensued, apparently on a question of money.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis old Mr. Derriman come home!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said Anne. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) has hired that horse
from the bathing-machine to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>). Only fancy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the farmer companion</b></font>)</div><p/>Before they had gone many steps further the farmer and his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) companion had
ended their dispute, and the latter mounted the horse and cantered away,
Uncle Benjy coming on to the house at a nimble pace. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>)
observed Loveday and Anne, he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) fell into a feebler gait; when they came up
he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) recognized Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have torn yourself away from King George's Esplanade so soon,
Farmer Derriman?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, faith! I couldn't bide at such a ruination place,''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>said the
farmer. ``Your hand in your pocket every minute of the day. <div class="bookquote">``Tis a
shilling for this, half-a-crown for that; if you only eat one egg, or
even a poor windfall of an apple, you've got to pay; and a bunch o'
radishes is a halfpenny, and a quart o' cider a good tuppence
three-farthings at lowest reckoning. Nothing without paying! I couldn't
even get a ride homeward upon that screw without the man wanting a
shilling for it, when my weight didn't take a penny out of the beast.
I've saved a penn`orth or so of shoeleather to be sure; but the saddle
was so rough wi' patches that 'a took twopence out of the seat of my best
breeches. King George hev' ruined the town for other folks. More than
that, my nephew promised to come there to-morrow to see me, and if I had
stayed I must have treated en. Hey--what's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a shout from within the walls of the building, and Loveday said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your nephew is here, and has company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My nephew _here_?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>gasped the old man. <div class="bookquote">``Good folks, will you come up to
the door with me? I mean--hee--hee--just for company! Dear me, I
thought my house was as quiet as a church?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div><p/>They went back to the window, and the farmer looked in, his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) mouth falling
apart to a greater width at the corners than in the middle, and his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)
fingers assuming a state of radiation.

<p/>''`Tis my best silver tankards they've got, that I've never used! O! `tis
my strong beer! <div class="bookquote">``Tis eight candles guttering away, when I've used
nothing but twenties myself for the last half-year!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't know he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) was here, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Loveday.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O no!''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>said the farmer, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) head half-way. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing's known to
poor I! There's my best rummers jingling as careless as if 'twas tin
cups; and my table scratched, and my chairs wrenched out of joint. See
how they tilt 'em on the two back legs--and that's ruin to a chair! Ah!
when I be gone he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) won't find another old man to make such work with, and
provide goods for his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) breaking, and house-room and drink for his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) tear-
brass set!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Comrades and fellow-soldiers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus to the hot farmers and yeomen
he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) entertained within, `as we have vowed to brave danger and death
together, so we'll share the couch of peace. You shall sleep here to-
night, for it is getting late. My scram blue-vinnied gallicrow of an
uncle takes care that there shan't be much comfort in the house, but you
can curl up on the furniture if beds run short. As for my sleep, it
won't be much. I'm melancholy! A woman has, I may say, got my heart in
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pocket, and I have hers in mine. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s not much--to other folk, I
mean--but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is to me. The little thing came in my way, and conquered
me. I fancy that simple girl! I ought to have looked higher--I know it;
what of that? <div class="bookquote">``Tis a fate that may happen to the greatest men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whash her (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) name?''  (<font color='red'><b>the warriors</b></font>)</div>said one of the warriors, whose head occasionally
drooped upon his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) epaulettes, and whose eyes fell together in the casual
manner characteristic of the tired soldier. -LRB-It was really Farmer Stubb,
of Duddle Hole.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) name? Well, `tis spelt, A, N--but, by gad, I won't give ye her (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) name
here in company. She (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) don't live a hundred miles off, however, and she (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)
wears the prettiest cap-ribbons you ever saw. Well, well, `tis weakness!
She (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) has little, and I have much; but I do adore that girl, in spite of
myself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Prithee stand by an old man till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s got into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house!''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>implored
Uncle Benjy. <div class="bookquote">``I only ask ye to bide within call. Stand back under the
trees, and I'll do my poor best to give no trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll stand by you for half-an-hour, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Loveday. <div class="bookquote">``After that I
must bolt to camp.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; bide back there under the trees,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Benjy. ``I don't
want to spite <div class="bookquote">``em?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll wait a few minutes, just to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gets in?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said the trumpet-
major to Anne as they retired from the old man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to get home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne anxiously.

<p/>When they had quite receded behind the tree-trunks and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood alone,
Uncle Benjy, to their surprise, set up a loud shout, altogether beyond
the imagined power of his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) lungs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Man a-lost! man a-lost!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) cried, repeating the exclamation several
times; and then ran and hid himself behind a corner of the building. Soon
the door opened, and Festus and his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) guests came tumbling out upon the
green.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis our duty to help folks in distress,''  (<font color='red'><b>guests</b></font>)</div>said Festus. <div class="bookquote">``Man a-lost,
where are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">'''Twas across there,''  (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>said one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) friends.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! 'twas here,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said another.

<p/>Meanwhile Uncle Benjy, coming from his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) hiding-place, had scampered with
the quickness of a boy up to the door they had quitted, and slipped in.
In a moment the door flew together, and Anne heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) bolting and
barring it inside. The revellers, however, did not notice this, and came
on towards the spot where the trumpet-major and Anne were standing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's succour at hand, friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus. <div class="bookquote">``We are all king's men;
do not fear us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Loveday; `so are we.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) explained in two words that
they were not the distressed traveller who had cried out, and turned to
go on.

<p/>''`Tis she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)! my life, `tis she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said Festus, now first recognizing Anne.
<div class="bookquote">``Fair Anne, I will not part from you till I see you safe at your own dear
door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'s in my hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Loveday civilly, though not without firmness,
`so it is not required, thank you.''

<p/>``Man, had I but my sword--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Loveday, <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to quarrel. Let's put it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).
Whichever of us she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) likes best, he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) shall take her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) home. Miss Anne,
which?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne would much rather have gone home alone, but seeing the remainder of
the yeomanry party staggering up she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thought it best to secure a
protector of some kind. How to choose one without offending the other
and provoking a quarrel was the difficulty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must both walk home with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) adroitly said, `one on one side,
and one on the other. And if you are not quite civil to one another all
the time, I'll never speak to either of you again.''

<p/>They agreed to the terms, and the other yeomen arriving at this time said
they would go also as rearguard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne. <div class="bookquote">``Now go and get your hats, and don't be long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes; our hats,''  (<font color='red'><b>the yeomanry</b></font>)</div>said the yeomanry, whose heads were so hot that they
had forgotten their nakedness till then.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll wait till we've got 'em--we won't be a moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus
eagerly.

<p/>Anne and Loveday said yes, and Festus ran back to the house, followed by
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) band.

<p/>``Now let's run and leave <div class="bookquote">``em,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Anne, when they were out of hearing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But we've promised to wait!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the trumpet-major in surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Promised to wait!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne indignantly. <div class="bookquote">``As if one ought to keep such
a promise to drunken men as that. You can do as you like, I shall go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is hardly fair to leave the chaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Loveday reluctantly, and
looking back at them. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heard no more, and flitting off under the
trees, was soon lost to his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) sight.

<p/>Festus and the rest had by this time reached Uncle Benjy's door, which
they were discomfited and astonished to find closed. They began to
knock, and then to kick at the venerable timber, till the old man's head,
crowned with a tasselled nightcap, appeared at an upper window, followed
by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulders, with apparently nothing on but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shirt, though it was
in truth a sheet thrown over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fie, fie upon ye all for making such a hullaballoo at a weak old man's
door,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, yawning. <div class="bookquote">``What's in ye to rouse honest folks at this
time o' night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hang me--why--it's Uncle Benjy! Haw--haw--haw?''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus. ``Nunc,
why how the devil's this? <div class="bookquote">``Tis I--Festus--wanting to come in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no, no, my clever man, whoever you be!''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Benjy in a tone of
incredulous integrity. <div class="bookquote">``My nephew, dear boy, is miles away at quarters,
and sound asleep by this time, as becomes a good soldier. That story
won't do to-night, my man, not at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my soul `tis I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to-night, my man; not to-night! Anthony, bring my blunderbuss,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>said the farmer, turning and addressing nobody inside the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's break in the window-shutters,''  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>said one of the others.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My wig, and we will!''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus. <div class="bookquote">``What a trick of the old man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Get some big stones,''  (<font color='red'><b>the yeomen</b></font>)</div>said the yeomen, searching under the wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; forbear, forbear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus, beginning to be frightened at the
spirit he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) had raised. <div class="bookquote">``I forget; we should drive him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into fits, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s
subject to 'em, and then perhaps `twould be manslaughter. Comrades, we
must march! No, we'll lie in the barn. I'll see into this, take my word
for `t. Our honour is at stake. Now let's back to see my beauty home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We can't, as we hav'n't got our hats,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob</b></font>)</div>said one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)
fellow-troopers--in domestic life Jacob Noakes, of Muckleford Farm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No more we can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus, in a melancholy tone. <div class="bookquote">``But I must go to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Comrades</b></font>) and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Comrades</b></font>) the reason. She (<font color='blue'><b>Comrades</b></font>) pulls me in spite of all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Comrades</b></font>)'s gone. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Comrades</b></font>) flee across park while we were knocking at the
door,''  (<font color='red'><b>the yeomanry</b></font>)</div>said another of the yeomanry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gone!''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus, grinding his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) teeth and putting himself into a rigid
shape. ``Then `tis my enemy--he (<font color='blue'><b>Comrades</b></font>) has tempted her (<font color='blue'><b>Comrades</b></font>) away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Comrades</b></font>)! But I am
a rich man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s poor, and rides the King's horse while I ride my
own. Could I but find that fellow, that regular, that common man, I
would--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the trumpet-major, coming up behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I,'--sai''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>Festus, starting round,--``I would seize him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the hand and

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A good speech. And I will, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Loveday heartily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now for shelter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus to his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) companions.

<p/>They then unceremoniously left Loveday, without wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) good-night,
and proceeded towards the barn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) crossed the park and ascended the
down to the camp, grieved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) had given Anne cause of complaint, and
fancying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) held him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) of slight account beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) wealthier rival.




<p/>X. THE MATCH-MAKING VIRTUES OF A DOUBLE GARDEN


<p/>Anne was so flurried by the military incidents attending her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) return home
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was almost afraid to venture alone outside her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother's
premises. Moreover, the numerous soldiers, regular and otherwise, that
haunted Overcombe and its neighbourhood, were getting better acquainted
with the villagers, and the result was that they were always standing at
garden gates, walking in the orchards, or sitting gossiping just within
cottage doors, with the bowls of their tobacco-pipes thrust outside for
politeness' sake, that they might not defile the air of the household.
Being gentlemen of a gallant and most affectionate nature, they naturally
turned their heads and smiled if a pretty girl passed by, which was
rather disconcerting to the latter if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were unused to society. Every
belle in the village soon had a lover, and when the belles were all
allotted those who scarcely deserved that title had their turn, many of
the soldiers being not at all particular about half-an-inch of nose more
or less, a trifling deficiency of teeth, or a larger crop of freckles
than is customary in the Saxon race. Thus, with one and another,
courtship began to be practised in Overcombe on rather a large scale, and
the dispossessed young men who had been born in the place were left to
take their walks alone, where, instead of studying the works of nature,
they meditated gross outrages on the brave men who had been so good as to
visit their village.

<p/>Anne watched these romantic proceedings from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) window with much
interest, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw how triumphantly other handsome girls of the
neighbourhood walked by on the gorgeous arms of Lieutenant Knockheelmann,
Cornet Flitzenhart, and Captain Klaspenkissen, of the thrilling York
Hussars, who swore the most picturesque foreign oaths, and had a
wonderful sort of estate or property called the Vaterland in their
country across the sea, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was filled with a sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own
loneliness. It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) think of things which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tried to forget, and
to look into a little drawer at something soft and brown that lay in a
curl there, wrapped in paper. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could bear it no longer, and
went downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garland.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To see the folks, because I am so gloomy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not at present, Anne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, blushing with an indefinite sense of being
very wicked.

<p/>``Because you must not. I have been going to tell you several times not
to go into the street at this time of day. Why not walk in the morning?
There's young Mr. Derriman would be glad to--'

<p/>``Don't mention him (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>), mother, don<div class="bookquote">``t!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, dear, walk in the garden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>So poor Anne, who really had not the slightest wish to throw her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heart
away upon a soldier, but merely wanted to displace old thoughts by new,
turned into the inner garden from day to day, and passed a good many
hours there, the pleasant birds singing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and the delightful
butterflies alighting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hat, and the horrid ants running up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
stockings.

<p/>This garden was undivided from Loveday's, the two having originally been
the single garden of the whole house. It was a quaint old place,
enclosed by a thorn hedge so shapely and dense from incessant clipping
that the mill-boy could walk along the top without sinking in--a feat
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) often performed as a means of filling out his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) day's work. The
soil within was of that intense fat blackness which is only seen after a
century of constant cultivation. The paths were grassed over, so that
people came and went upon them without being heard. The grass harboured
slugs, and on this account the miller was going to replace it by gravel
as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) had time; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) had said this for thirty years without
doing it, the grass and the slugs seemed likely to remain.

<p/>The miller's man attended to Mrs. Garland's piece of the garden as well
as to the larger portion, digging, planting, and weeding indifferently in
both, the miller observing with reason that it was not worth while for a
helpless widow lady to hire a man for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) little plot when his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) man,
working alongside, could tend it without much addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) labour. The
two households were on this account even more closely united in the
garden than within the mill. Out there they were almost one family, and
they talked from plot to plot with a zest and animation which Mrs.
Garland could never have anticipated when she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) first removed thither after
her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) husband's death.

<p/>The lower half of the garden, farthest from the road, was the most snug
and sheltered part of this snug and sheltered enclosure, and it was well
watered as the land of Lot. Three small brooks, about a yard wide, ran
with a tinkling sound from side to side between the plots, crossing the
path under wood slabs laid as bridges, and passing out of the garden
through little tunnels in the hedge. The brooks were so far overhung at
their brinks by grass and garden produce that, had it not been for their
perpetual babbling, few would have noticed that they were there. This
was where Anne liked best to linger when her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) excursions became restricted
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own premises; and in a spot of the garden not far removed the
trumpet-major loved to linger also.

<p/>Having by virtue of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) office no stable duty to perform, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) came down
from the camp to the mill almost every day; and Anne, finding that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
adroitly walked and sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) father's portion of the garden whenever
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did so in the other half, could not help smiling and speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).
So his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) epaulettes and blue jacket, and Anne's yellow gipsy hat, were
often seen in different parts of the garden at the same time; but he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
never intruded into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) part of the enclosure, nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) into
Loveday's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) always spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
replied in deep, firm accents across the gooseberry bushes, or through
the tall rows of flowering peas, as the case might be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) thus gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
accounts at fifteen paces of his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) experiences in camp, in quarters, in
Flanders, and elsewhere; of the difference between line and column, of
forced marches, billeting, and such-like, together with his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) hopes of
promotion. Anne listened at first indifferently; but knowing no one else
so good-natured and experienced, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) grew interested in him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) as in a
brother. By degrees his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) gold lace, buckles, and spurs lost all their
strangeness and were as familiar to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own clothes.

<p/>At last Mrs. Garland noticed this growing friendship, and began to
despair of her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) motherly scheme of uniting Anne to the moneyed Festus. Why
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not take prompt steps to check interference with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) plans
arose partly from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) nature, which was the reverse of managing, and
partly from a new emotional circumstance with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found it
difficult to reckon. The near neighbourhood that had produced the
friendship of Anne for John Loveday was slowly effecting a warmer liking
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother and his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) father.

<p/>Thus the month of July passed. The troop horses came with the regularity
of clockwork twice a day down to drink under her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) window, and, as the
weather grew hotter, kicked up their heels and shook their heads
furiously under the maddening sting of the dun-fly. The green leaves in
the garden became of a darker dye, the gooseberries ripened, and the
three brooks were reduced to half their winter volume.

<p/>At length the earnest trumpet-major obtained Mrs. Garland's consent to
take her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) daughter to the camp, which they had not yet viewed from
any closer point than their own windows. So one afternoon they went, the
miller being one of the party. The villagers were by this time driving a
roaring trade with the soldiers, who purchased of them every description
of garden produce, milk, butter, and eggs at liberal prices. The figures
of these rural sutlers could be seen creeping up the slopes, laden like
bees, to a spot in the rear of the camp, where there was a kind of market-
place on the greensward.

<p/>Mrs. Garland, Anne, and the miller were conducted from one place to
another, and on to the quarter where the soldiers' wives lived who had
not been able to get lodgings in the cottages near. The most sheltered
place had been chosen for them, and snug huts had been built for their
use by their husbands, of clods, hurdles, a little thatch, or whatever
they could lay hands on. The trumpet-major conducted his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) friends thence
to the large barn which had been appropriated as a hospital, and to the
cottage with its windows bricked up, that was used as the magazine; then
they inspected the lines of shining dark horses -LRB-each representing the
then high figure of two-and-twenty guineas purchase money-RRB-, standing
patiently at the ropes which stretched from one picket-post to another, a
bank being thrown up in front of them as a protection at night.

<p/>They passed on to the tents of the German Legion, a well-grown and rather
dandy set of men, with a poetical look about their faces which rendered
them interesting to feminine eyes. Hanoverians, Saxons, Prussians,
Swedes, Hungarians, and other foreigners were numbered in their ranks.
They were cleaning arms, which they leant carefully against a rail when
the work was complete.

<p/>On their return they passed the mess-house, a temporary wooden building
with a brick chimney. As Anne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) companions went by, a group of
three or four of the hussars were standing at the door talking to a
dashing young man, who was expatiating on the qualities of a horse that
one was inclined to buy. Anne recognized Festus Derriman in the seller,
and Cripplestraw was trotting the animal up and down. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
caught the yeoman's eye he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) came forward, making some friendly remark to
the miller, and then turning to Miss Garland, who kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) eyes steadily
fixed on the distant landscape till he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) got so near that it was impossible
to do so longer. Festus looked from Anne to the trumpet-major, and from
the trumpet-major back to Anne, with a dark expression of face, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)
suspected that there might be a tender understanding between them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you offended with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in a low voice of repressed
resentment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When are you coming to the hall again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garland, who had come near, and smiled
pleasantly on Festus. <div class="bookquote">``You can go at any time, as usual.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) come with me now, Mrs. Garland; I should be pleased to walk
along with her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>). My man can lead home the horse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, but I shall not come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Miss Anne coldly.

<p/>The widow looked unhappily in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) daughter's face, distressed between her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
desire that Anne should encourage Festus, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wish to consult Anne's
own feelings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) alone, leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus, his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) gaze blackening.
``Now I think of it I am glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) can't come with me, for I am engaged;'
and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stalked away.

<p/>Anne moved on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother, young Loveday silently following, and they
began to descend the hill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, where's Mr. Loveday?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Garland.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father's behind,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John.

<p/>Mrs. Garland looked behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) solicitously; and the miller, who had been
waiting for the event, beckoned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll overtake you in a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) said to the younger pair, and went
back, her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) colour, for some unaccountable reason, rising as she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) did so.
The miller and she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) then came on slowly together, conversing in very low
tones, and when they got to the bottom they stood still. Loveday and
Anne waited for them, saying but little to each other, for the rencounter
with Festus had damped the spirits of both. At last the widow's private
talk with Miller Loveday came to an end, and she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) hastened onward, the
miller going in another direction to meet a man on business. When she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
reached the trumpet-major and Anne she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was looking very bright and rather
flurried, and seemed sorry when Loveday said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) must leave them and
return to the camp. They parted in their usual friendly manner, and Anne
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother were left to walk the few remaining yards alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, I've settled it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garland. <div class="bookquote">``Anne, what are you
thinking about? I have settled in my mind that it is all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That you do not care for Derriman, and mean to encourage John Loveday.
What's all the world so long as folks are happy! Child, don't take any
notice of what I have said about Festus, and don't meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a weathercock you are, mother! Why should you say that just now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is easy to call me a weathercock,''  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said the matron, putting on the
look of a good woman; `but I have reasoned it out, and at last, thank
God, I have got over my ambition. The Lovedays are our true and only
friends, and Mr. Festus Derriman, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) money, is nothing to us at
all.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, `what has made you change all of a sudden from what you
have said before?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My feelings and my reason, which I am thankful for!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother's sentiments were naturally so versatile that
they could not be depended on for two days together; but it did not occur
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) for the moment that a change had been helped on in the present
case by a romantic talk between Mrs. Garland and the miller. But Mrs.
Garland could not keep the secret long. She (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) chatted gaily as she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) walked,
and before they had entered the house she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``What do you think Mr
Loveday has been saying to me, dear Anne?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne did not know at all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) has asked me to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>).''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>XI. OUR PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED BY THE PRESENCE OF ROYALTY


<p/>To explain the miller's sudden proposal it is only necessary to go back
to that moment when Anne, Festus, and Mrs. Garland were talking together
on the down. John Loveday had fallen behind so as not to interfere with
a meeting in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) was decidedly superfluous; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) father, who
guessed the trumpet-major's secret, watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) stood. John's
face was sad, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) eyes followed Mrs. Garland's encouraging manner to
Festus in a way which plainly said that every parting of her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) lips was
tribulation to him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>). The miller loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) son as much as any miller or
private gentleman could do, and he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) was pained to see John's gloom at such
a trivial circumstance. So what did he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) resolve but to help John there
and then by precipitating a matter which, had he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) himself been the only
person concerned, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would have delayed for another six months.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had long liked the society of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) impulsive, tractable neighbour, Mrs.
Garland; had mentally taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) up and pondered her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) in connexion with the
question whether it would not be for the happiness of both if she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) were to
share his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) home, even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) was a little his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) superior in antecedents
and knowledge. In fact he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>); not tragically, but to a very
creditable extent for his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) years; that is, next to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sons, Bob and John,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) knew very well of that ploughed-ground appearance near the
corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) once handsome eyes, and that the little depression in her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>)
right cheek was not the lingering dimple it was poetically assumed to be,
but a result of the abstraction of some worn-out nether millstones within
the cheek by Rootle, the Budmouth man, who lived by such practices on the
heads of the elderly. But what of that, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had lost two to each one
of hers, and exceeded her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) in age by some eight years! To do John a
service, then, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) quickened his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) designs, and put the question to her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>)
while they were standing under the eyes of the younger pair.

<p/>Mrs. Garland, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) had been interested in the miller for a long
time, and had for a moment now and then thought on this question as far
as, ``Suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) should, <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) were to,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>and so on, had never thought
much further; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) was really taken by surprise when the question
came. She (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) answered without affectation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) would think over the
proposal; and thus they parted.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) mother's infirmity of purpose set Anne thinking, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was suddenly
filled with a conviction that in such a case she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ought to have some
purpose herself. Mrs. Garland's complacency at the miller's offer had,
in truth, amazed her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>). While her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) mother had held up her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) head, and
recommended Festus, it had seemed a very pretty thing to rebel; but the
pressure being removed an awful sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) own responsibility took
possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) mind. As there was no longer anybody to be wise or
ambitious for her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>), surely she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) should be wise and ambitious for herself,
discountenance her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) mother's attachment, and encourage Festus in his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)
addresses, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) own and her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) mother's good. There had been a time when
a Loveday thrilled her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) own heart; but that was long ago, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) had
thought of position or differences. To wake into cold daylight like
this, when and because her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) mother had gone into the land of romance, was
dreadful and new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>), and like an increase of years without living
them.

<p/>But it was easier to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) ought to marry the yeoman than to
take steps for doing it; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) went on living just as before, only with
a little more thoughtfulness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>Two days after the visit to the camp, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) was again in the garden,
Soldier Loveday said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>), at a distance of five rows of beans and a
parsley-bed--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have heard the news, Miss Garland?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, without looking up from a book she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was reading.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The King is coming to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The King?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) looked up then.

<p/>``Yes; to Gloucester Lodge; and he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) will pass this way. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) can't arrive
till long past the middle of the night, if what they say is true, that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
is timed to change horses at Woodyates Inn--between Mid and South
Wessex--at twelve o<div class="bookquote">``clock,''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>continued Loveday, encouraged by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) interest
to cut off the parsley-bed from the distance between them.

<p/>Miller Loveday came round the corner of the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have ye heard about the King coming, Miss Maidy Anne?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) said.

<p/>Anne said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had just heard of it; and the trumpet-major, who
hardly welcomed his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) father at such a moment, explained what he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) knew of
the matter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you will go with your regiment to meet `en, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said old
Loveday.

<p/>Young Loveday said that the men of the German Legion were to perform that
duty. And turning half from his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) father, and half towards Anne, he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) added,
in a tentative tone, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) might get leave for the night, if
anybody would like to be taken to the top of the Ridgeway over which the
royal party must pass.

<p/>Anne, knowing by this time of the budding hope in the gallant dragoon's
mind, and not wishing to encourage it, said, <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the dragoon</b></font>)</div><p/>The miller looked disappointed as well as John.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your mother might like to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am going indoors, and I'll ask her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) if you wish me to,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went indoors and rather coldly told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother of the proposal. Mrs.
Garland, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) had determined not to answer the miller's question on
matrimony just yet, was quite ready for this jaunt, and in spite of Anne
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sailed off at once to the garden to hear more about it. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) re-
entered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anne, I have not seen the King or the King's horses for these many
years; and I am going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, it is well to be you, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, in an elderly tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you won't come with us?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garland, rather rebuffed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have very different things to think of,''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) daughter with
virtuous emphasis, `than going to see sights at that time of night.''

<p/>Mrs. Garland was sorry, but resolved to adhere to the arrangement. The
night came on; and it having gone abroad that the King would pass by the
road, many of the villagers went out to see the procession. When the two
Lovedays and Mrs. Garland were gone, Anne bolted the door for security,
and sat down to think again on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) grave responsibilities in the choice
of a husband, now that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) natural guardian could no longer be trusted.

<p/>A knock came to the door.

<p/>Anne's instinct was at once to be silent, that the comer might think the
family had retired.

<p/>The knocking person, however, was not to be easily persuaded. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had in
fact seen rays of light over the top of the shutter, and, unable to get
an answer, went on to the door of the mill, which was still going, the
miller sometimes grinding all night when busy. The grinder accompanied
the stranger to Mrs. Garland's door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The daughter is certainly at home, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the grinder. <div class="bookquote">``I'll go
round to t`other side, and see if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s there, Master Derriman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to take her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) out to see the King,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus.

<p/>Anne had started at the sound of the voice. No opportunity could have
been better for carrying out her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) new convictions on the disposal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
hand. But in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mortal dislike of Festus, Anne forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) principles,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) idea of keeping herself above the Lovedays. Tossing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hat
and blowing out the candle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) slipped out at the back door, and hastily
followed in the direction that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother and the rest had taken. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
overtook them as they were beginning to climb the hill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! you have altered your mind after all?''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow. <div class="bookquote">``How came
you to do that, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought I might as well come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure you did,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller heartily. <div class="bookquote">``A good deal better than
biding at home there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div><p/>John said nothing, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could almost see through the gloom how glad
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had altered her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mind. When they reached the ridge over
which the highway stretched they found many of their neighbours who had
got there before them idling on the grass border between the roadway and
the hedge, enjoying a sort of midnight picnic, which it was easy to do,
the air being still and dry. Some carriages were also standing near,
though most people of the district who possessed four wheels, or even
two, had driven into the town to await the King there. From this height
could be seen in the distance the position of the watering-place, an
additional number of lanterns, lamps, and candles having been lighted to-
night by the loyal burghers to grace the royal entry, if it should occur
before dawn.

<p/>Mrs. Garland touched Anne's elbow several times as they walked, and the
young woman at last understood that this was meant as a hint to her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) to
take the trumpet-major's arm, which its owner was rather suggesting than
offering to her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>). Anne wondered what infatuation was possessing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
mother, declined to take the arm, and contrived to get in front with the
miller, who mostly kept in the van to guide the others' footsteps. The
trumpet-major was left with Mrs. Garland, and Anne's encouraging pursuit
of them induced him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) to say a few words to the former.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By your leave, ma'am, I'll speak to you on something that concerns my
mind very much indeed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is my wish to be allowed to pay my addresses to your daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you meant that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garland simply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you'll not object?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall leave it to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) will agree, even if I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The soldier</b></font>)</div><p/>The soldier sighed, and seemed helpless. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I can but ask her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
said.

<p/>The spot on which they had finally chosen to wait for the King was by a
field gate, whence the white road could be seen for a long distance
northwards by day, and some little distance now. They lingered and
lingered, but no King came to break the silence of that beautiful summer
night. As half-hour after half-hour glided by, and nobody came, Anne
began to get weary; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew why her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother did not propose to go back,
and regretted the reason. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would have proposed it herself, but that
Mrs. Garland seemed so cheerful, and as wide awake as at noonday, so that
it was almost a cruelty to disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>).

<p/>The trumpet-major at last made up his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) mind, and tried to draw Anne into a
private conversation. The feeling which a week ago had been a vague and
piquant aspiration, was to-day altogether too lively for the reasoning of
this warm-hearted soldier to regulate. So he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) persevered in his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) intention
to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) alone, and at last, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) manoeuvres to the
contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) succeeded. The miller and Mrs. Garland had walked about
fifty yards further on, and Anne and himself were left standing by the
gate.

<p/>But the gallant musician's soul was so much disturbed by tender
vibrations and by the sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) presumption that he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) could not begin;
and it may be questioned if he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) would ever have broached the subject at
all, had not a distant church clock opportunely assisted him (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) by striking
the hour of three. The trumpet-major heaved a breath of relief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That clock strikes in G sharp,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed--G sharp?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne civilly.

<p/>``Yes. <div class="bookquote">``Tis a fine-toned bell. I used to notice that note when I was a
boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you--the very same?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and since then I had a wager about that bell with the bandmaster of
the North Wessex Militia. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said the note was G; I said it wasn't. When
we found it G sharp we didn't know how to settle it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not a deep note for a clock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no! The finest tenor bell about here is the bell of Peter's,
Casterbridge--in E flat. Tum-m-m-m--that's the note--tum-m-m-m.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The
trumpet-major sounded from far down his (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) throat what he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) considered to be E
flat, with a parenthetic sense of luxury unquenchable even by his (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) present
distraction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we go on to where my mother is?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, less impressed by the
beauty of the note than the trumpet-major himself was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In one minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) said tremulously. <div class="bookquote">``Talking of music--I fear you
don't think the rank of a trumpet-major much to compare with your own?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do. I think a trumpet-major a very respectable man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to hear you say that. It is given out by the King's command
that trumpet-majors are to be considered respectable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! Then I am, by chance, more loyal than I thought for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I get a good deal a year extra to the trumpeters, because of my
position.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's very nice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I am not supposed ever to drink with the trumpeters who serve
beneath me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Naturally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And, by the orders of the War Office, I am to exert over them -LRB-that's
the government word-RRB- exert over them full authority; and if any one
behaves towards me with the least impropriety, or neglects my orders, he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
is to be confined and reported.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is really a dignified post,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, with, however, a reserve of
enthusiasm which was not altogether encouraging.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And of course some day I shall,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dragoon</b></font>)</div>stammered the dragoon--`shall be in
rather a better position than I am at present.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to hear it, Mr. Loveday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And in short, Mistress Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>continued John Loveday bravely and
desperately, `may I pay court to you in the hope that--no, no, don't go
away!--you haven't heard yet--that you may make me the happiest of men;
not yet, but when peace is proclaimed and all is smooth and easy again? I
can't put it any better, though there's more to be explained.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is most awkward,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, evidently with pain. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot
possibly agree; believe me, Mr. Loveday, I cannot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there's more than this. You would be surprised to see what snug
rooms the married trumpet- and sergeant-majors have in quarters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Barracks are not all; consider camp and war.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That brings me to my strong point!''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the soldier hopefully. <div class="bookquote">``My
father is better off than most non-commissioned officers' fathers; and
there's always a home for you at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) house in any emergency. I can tell
you privately that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has enough to keep us both, and if you wouldn't
hear of barracks, well, peace once established, I'd live at home as a
miller and farmer--next door to your own mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother would be sure to object,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>expostulated Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) leaves it all to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! you have asked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, with surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I thought it would not be honourable to act otherwise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's very good of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face warming with a generous
sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) straightforwardness. <div class="bookquote">``But my mother is so entirely ignorant
of a soldier's life, and the life of a soldier's wife--she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is so simple
in all such matters, that I cannot listen to you any more readily for
what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) may say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it is all over for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said the poor trumpet-major, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
face and putting away his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) handkerchief with an air of finality.

<p/>Anne was silent. Any woman who has ever tried will know without
explanation what an unpalatable task it is to dismiss, even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) does
not love him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>), a man who has all the natural and moral qualities she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would
desire, and only fails in the social. Would-be lovers are not so
numerous, even with the best women, that the sacrifice of one can be felt
as other than a good thing wasted, in a world where there are few good
things.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not angry, Miss Garland?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>), finding that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not
speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O no. Don't let us say anything more about this now.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) moved
on.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) drew near to the miller and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) perceived that they
were engaged in a conversation of that peculiar kind which is all the
more full and communicative from the fact of definitive words being few.
In short, here the game was succeeding which with herself had failed. It
was pretty clear from the symptoms, marks, tokens, telegraphs, and
general byplay between widower and widow, that Miller Loveday must have
again said to Mrs. Garland some such thing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had said before, with
what result this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) did not know.

<p/>As the situation was delicate, Anne halted awhile apart from them. The
trumpet-major, quite ignorant of how his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) cause was entered into by the
white-coated man in the distance -LRB-for his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) father had not yet told him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) designs upon Mrs. Garland-RRB-, did not advance, but stood still by the
gate, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) were attending a princess, waiting till he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) should be
called up. Thus they lingered, and the day began to break. Mrs. Garland
and the miller took no heed of the time, and what it was bringing to
earth and sky, so occupied were they with themselves; but Anne in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
place and the trumpet-major in his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>), each in private thought of no bright
kind, watched the gradual glory of the east through all its tones and
changes. The world of birds and insects got lively, the blue and the
yellow and the gold of Loveday's uniform again became distinct; the sun
bored its way upward, the fields, the trees, and the distant landscape
kindled to flame, and the trumpet-major, backed by a lilac shadow as tall
as a steeple, blazed in the rays like a very god of war.

<p/>It was half-past three o'clock. A short time after, a rattle of horses
and wheels reached their ears from the quarter in which they gazed, and
there appeared upon the white line of road a moving mass, which presently
ascended the hill and drew near.

<p/>Then there arose a huzza from the few knots of watchers gathered there,
and they cried, <div class="bookquote">``Long live King Jarge!''  (<font color='red'><b>watchers</b></font>)</div>The cortege passed abreast. It
consisted of three travelling-carriages, escorted by a detachment of the
German Legion. Anne was told to look in the first carriage--a
post-chariot drawn by four horses--for the King and Queen, and was
rewarded by seeing a profile reminding her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) of the current coin of the
realm; but as the party had been travelling all night, and the spectators
here gathered were few, none of the royal family looked out of the
carriage windows. It was said that the two elder princesses were in the
same carriage, but they remained invisible. The next vehicle, a coach
and four, contained more princesses, and the third some of their
attendants.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God, I have seen my King!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garland, when they had all
gone by.

<p/>Nobody else expressed any thankfulness, for most of them had expected a
more pompous procession than the bucolic tastes of the King cared to
indulge in; and one old man said grimly that that sight of dusty old
leather coaches was not worth waiting for. Anne looked hither and
thither in the bright rays of the day, each of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes having a little
sun in it, which gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) glance a peculiar golden fire, and kindled the
brown curls grouped over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) forehead to a yellow brilliancy, and made
single hairs, blown astray by the night, look like lacquered wires. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
was wondering if Festus were anywhere near, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>).

<p/>Before they left the ridge they turned their attention towards the Royal
watering-place, which was visible at this place only as a portion of the
sea-shore, from which the night-mist was rolling slowly back. The sea
beyond was still wrapped in summer fog, the ships in the roads showing
through it as black spiders suspended in the air. While they looked and
walked a white jet of smoke burst from a spot which the miller knew to be
the battery in front of the King's residence, and then the report of guns
reached their ears. This announcement was answered by a salute from the
Castle of the adjoining Isle, and the ships in the neighbouring
anchorage. All the bells in the town began ringing. The King and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
family had arrived.




<p/>XII. HOW EVERYBODY GREAT AND SMALL CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF THE DOWNS


<p/>As the days went on, echoes of the life and bustle of the town reached
the ears of the quiet people in Overcombe hollow--exciting and moving
those unimportant natives as a ground-swell moves the weeds in a cave.
Travelling-carriages of all kinds and colours climbed and descended the
road that led towards the seaside borough. Some contained those
personages of the King's suite who had not kept pace with him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
journey from Windsor; others were the coaches of aristocracy, big and
little, whom news of the King's arrival drew thither for their own
pleasure: so that the highway, as seen from the hills about Overcombe,
appeared like an ant-walk--a constant succession of dark spots creeping
along its surface at nearly uniform rates of progress, and all in one
direction.

<p/>The traffic and intelligence between camp and town passed in a measure
over the villagers' heads. It being summer time the miller was much
occupied with business, and the trumpet-major was too constantly engaged
in marching between the camp and Gloucester Lodge with the rest of the
dragoons to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) friends any news for some days.

<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) sent a message that there was to be a review on the downs by
the King, and that it was fixed for the day following. This information
soon spread through the village and country round, and next morning the
whole population of Overcombe--except two or three very old men and
women, a few babies and their nurses, a cripple, and Corporal
Tullidge--ascended the slope with the crowds from afar, and awaited the
events of the day.

<p/>The miller wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Corporal</b></font>) best coat on this occasion, which meant a good deal.
An Overcombe man in those days would have a best coat, and keep it as a
best coat half his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life. The miller's had seen five and twenty summers
chiefly through the chinks of a clothes-box, and was not at all shabby as
yet, though getting singular. But that could not be helped; common coats
and best coats were distinct species, and never interchangeable. Living
so near the scene of the review he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) walked up the hill, accompanied by
Mrs. Garland and Anne as usual.

<p/>It was a clear day, with little wind stirring, and the view from the
downs, one of the most extensive in the county, was unclouded. The eye
of any observer who cared for such things swept over the wave-washed
town, and the bay beyond, and the Isle, with its pebble bank, lying on
the sea to the left of these, like a great crouching animal tethered to
the mainland. On the extreme east of the marine horizon, St. Aldhelm's
Head closed the scene, the sea to the southward of that point glaring
like a mirror under the sun. Inland could be seen Badbury Rings, where a
beacon had been recently erected; and nearer, Rainbarrow, on Egdon Heath,
where another stood: farther to the left Bulbarrow, where there was yet
another. Not far from this came Nettlecombe Tout; to the west, Dogberry
Hill, and Black`on near to the foreground, the beacon thereon being built
of furze faggots thatched with straw, and standing on the spot where the
monument now raises its head.

<p/>At nine o'clock the troops marched upon the ground--some from the camps
in the vicinity, and some from quarters in the different towns round
about. The approaches to the down were blocked with carriages of all
descriptions, ages, and colours, and with pedestrians of every class. At
ten the royal personages were said to be drawing near, and soon after the
King, accompanied by the Dukes of Cambridge and Cumberland, and a couple
of generals, appeared on horseback, wearing a round hat turned up at the
side, with a cockade and military feather. -LRB-Sensation among the crowd.-RRB-
Then the Queen and three of the princesses entered the field in a great
coach drawn by six beautiful cream-coloured horses. Another coach, with
four horses of the same sort, brought the two remaining princesses.
-LRB-Confused acclamations, <div class="bookquote">``There's King Jarge!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's Queen Sharlett!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Princess ``Lizabeth!'' <div class="bookquote">``Princesses Sophiar and Meelyer!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>etc., from the
surrounding spectators.-RRB-

<p/>Anne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) party were fortunate enough to secure a position on the top
of one of the barrows which rose here and there on the down; and the
miller having gallantly constructed a little cairn of flints, he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) placed
the two women thereon, by which means they were enabled to see over the
heads, horses, and coaches of the multitudes below and around. At the
march-past the miller's eye, which had been wandering about for the
purpose, discovered his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) son in his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) place by the trumpeters, who had moved
forwards in two ranks, and were sounding the march.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's John!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) cried to the widow. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) trumpet-sling is of two
colours, d'ye see; and the others be plain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Garland too saw him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) now, and enthusiastically admired him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>)
hands upwards, and Anne silently did the same. But before the young
woman's eyes had quite left the trumpet-major they fell upon the figure
of Yeoman Festus riding with his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeoman</b></font>) troop, and keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeoman</b></font>) face at a medium
between haughtiness and mere bravery. He (<font color='blue'><b>Yeoman</b></font>) certainly looked as soldierly
as any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeoman</b></font>) own corps, and felt more soldierly than half-a-dozen, as
anybody could see by observing him (<font color='blue'><b>Yeoman</b></font>). Anne got behind the miller, in case
Festus should discover her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and, regardless of his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) monarch, rush upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
in a rage with, <div class="bookquote">``Why the devil did you run away from me that night--hey,
madam?''  (<font color='red'><b>monarch rush</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) resolved to think no more of him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) just now, and to stick
to Loveday, who was her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother's friend. In this she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was helped by the
stirring tones which burst from the latter gentleman and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) subordinates
from time to time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller complacently, `there's few of more consequence in
a regiment than a trumpeter. He (<font color='blue'><b>trumpeter</b></font>)'s the chap that tells 'em what to do,
after all. Hey, Mrs. Garland?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) is, miller,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They could no more do without Jack and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) men than they could without
generals.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed they could not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garland again, in a tone of pleasant
agreement with any one in Great Britain or Ireland.

<p/>It was said that the line that day was three miles long, reaching from
the high ground on the right of where the people stood to the turnpike
road on the left. After the review came a sham fight, during which
action the crowd dispersed more widely over the downs, enabling Widow
Garland to get still clearer glimpses of the King, and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) handsome
charger, and the head of the Queen, and the elbows and shoulders of the
princesses in the carriages, and fractional parts of General Garth and
the Duke of Cumberland; which sights gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) great gratification. She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)
tugged at her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) daughter at every opportunity, exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``Now you can see
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) feather!''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There's her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) hat!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There's her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) Majesty's India muslin
shawl!''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>in a minor form of ecstasy, that made the miller think her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) more
girlish and animated than her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) daughter Anne.

<p/>In those military manoeuvres the miller followed the fortunes of one man;
Anne Garland of two. The spectators, who, unlike our party, had no
personal interest in the soldiery, saw only troops and battalions in the
concrete, straight lines of red, straight lines of blue, white lines
formed of innumerable knee-breeches, black lines formed of many gaiters,
coming and going in kaleidoscopic change. Who thought of every point in
the line as an isolated man, each dwelling all to himself in the
hermitage of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own mind? One person did, a young man far removed from
the barrow where the Garlands and Miller Loveday stood. The natural
expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) face was somewhat obscured by the bronzing effects of
rough weather, but the lines of his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) mouth showed that affectionate
impulses were strong within him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)--perhaps stronger than judgment well
could regulate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) wore a blue jacket with little brass buttons, and was
plainly a seafaring man.

<p/>Meanwhile, in the part of the plain where rose the tumulus on which the
miller had established himself, a broad-brimmed tradesman was elbowing
his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) way along. He (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) saw Mr. Loveday from the base of the barrow, and
beckoned to attract his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) attention. Loveday went halfway down, and the
other came up as near as he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) could.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miller,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, 'a letter has been lying at the post-office for
you for the last three days. If I had known that I should see ye here
I'd have brought it along with me.''

<p/>The miller thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for the news, and they parted, Loveday returning
to the summit. <div class="bookquote">``What a very strange thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) said to Mrs. Garland, who
had looked inquiringly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) face, now very grave. <div class="bookquote">``That was Budmouth
postmaster, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) says there's a letter for me. Ah, I now call to mind
that there _was_ a letter in the candle three days ago this very night--a
large red one; but foolish-like I thought nothing o`t. Who _can_ that
letter be from?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div><p/>A letter at this time was such an event for hamleteers, even of the
miller's respectable standing, that Loveday thenceforward was thrown into
a fit of abstraction which prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) seeing any more of the sham
fight, or the people, or the King. Mrs. Garland imbibed some of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
concern, and suggested that the letter might come from his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) son Robert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should naturally have thought that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Miller Loveday; `but he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
wrote to me only two months ago, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) brother John heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
within the last four weeks, when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was just about starting on another
voyage. If you'll pardon me, Mrs. Garland, ma'am, I'll see if there's
any Overcombe man here who is going to Budmouth to-day, so that I may get
the letter by night-time. I cannot possibly go myself.''

<p/>So Mr. Loveday left them for awhile; and as they were so near home Mrs.
Garland did not wait on the barrow for him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) to come back, but walked about
with Anne a little time, until they should be disposed to trot down the
slope to their own door. They listened to a man who was offering one
guinea to receive ten in case Buonaparte should be killed in three
months, and to other entertainments of that nature, which at this time
were not rare. Once during their peregrination the eyes of the sailor
before-mentioned fell upon Anne; but he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) glanced over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
unheedingly by. Loveday the elder was at this time on the other side of
the line, looking for a messenger to the town. At twelve o'clock the
review was over, and the King and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) family left the hill. The troops
then cleared off the field, the spectators followed, and by one o'clock
the downs were again bare.

<p/>They still spread their grassy surface to the sun as on that beautiful
morning not, historically speaking, so very long ago; but the King and
his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) fifteen thousand armed men, the horses, the bands of music, the
princesses, the cream-coloured teams--the gorgeous centre-piece, in
short, to which the downs were but the mere mount or margin--how entirely
have they all passed and gone!--lying scattered about the world as
military and other dust, some at Talavera, Albuera, Salamanca, Vittoria,
Toulouse, and Waterloo; some in home churchyards; and a few small
handfuls in royal vaults.

<p/>In the afternoon John Loveday, lightened of his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) trumpet and trappings,
appeared at the old mill-house door, and beheld Anne standing at hers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw you, Miss Garland,''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>said the soldier gaily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where was I?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the top of the big mound--to the right of the King.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I saw you; lots of times,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) rejoined.

<p/>Loveday seemed pleased. <div class="bookquote">``Did you really take the trouble to find me?
That was very good of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) eyes followed you everywhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garland from an upper
window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I looked at the dragoons most,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, disconcerted. <div class="bookquote">``And
when I looked at them my eyes naturally fell upon the trumpets. I looked
at the dragoons generally, no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not mean to show any vexation to the trumpet-major, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
fancied otherwise, and stood repressed. The situation was relieved by
the arrival of the miller, still looking serious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very much concerned, John; I did not go to the review for nothing.
There's a letter a-waiting for me at Budmouth, and I must get it before
bedtime, or I shan't sleep a wink.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John; `and perhaps Miss Garland would like to
see what's doing there to-day? Everybody is gone or going; the road is
like a fair.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) spoke pleadingly, but Anne was not won to assent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can drive in the gig; `twill do Blossom good,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let David drive Miss Garland,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said the trumpet-major, not wishing to
coerce her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I would just as soon walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne joyfully welcomed this arrangement, and a time was fixed for the
start.




<p/>XIII. THE CONVERSATION IN THE CROWD


<p/>In the afternoon they drove off, John Loveday being nowhere visible. All
along the road they passed and were overtaken by vehicles of all
descriptions going in the same direction; among them the extraordinary
machines which had been invented for the conveyance of troops to any
point of the coast on which the enemy should land; they consisted of four
boards placed across a sort of trolly, thirty men of the volunteer
companies riding on each.

<p/>The popular Georgian watering-place was in a paroxysm of gaiety. The
town was quite overpowered by the country round, much to the town's
delight and profit. The fear of invasion was such that six frigates lay
in the roads to ensure the safety of the royal family, and from the
regiments of horse and foot quartered at the barracks, or encamped on the
hills round about, a picket of a thousand men mounted guard every day in
front of Gloucester Lodge, where the King resided. When Anne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
attendant reached this point, which they did on foot, stabling the horse
on the outskirts of the town, it was about six o'clock. The King was on
the Esplanade, and the soldiers were just marching past to mount guard.
The band formed in front of the King, and all the officers saluted as
they went by.

<p/>Anne now felt herself close to and looking into the stream of recorded
history, within whose banks the littlest things are great, and outside
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and the general bulk of the human race were content to live on
as an unreckoned, unheeded superfluity.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) turned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) interested gaze at this scene, there stood John
Loveday. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had had a presentiment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) would turn up in this
mysterious way. It was marvellous that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) could have got there so
quickly; but there he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) was--not looking at the King, or at the crowd, but
waiting for the turn of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Trumpet-major, I didn't see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne demurely. <div class="bookquote">``How is it that
your regiment is not marching past?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We take it by turns, and it is not our turn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Loveday.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wanted to know then if they were afraid that the King would be
carried off by the First Consul. Yes, Loveday told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>); and his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) Majesty
was rather venturesome. A day or two before he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had gone so far to sea
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) was nearly caught by some of the enemy's cruisers. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) is
anxious to fight Boney single-handed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a good, brave King!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/>Loveday seemed anxious to come to more personal matters. <div class="bookquote">``Will you let
me take you round to the other side, where you can see better?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``The Queen and the princesses are at the window.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne passively assented. <div class="bookquote">``David, wait here for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I shall
be back again in a few minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The trumpet-major then led her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) off triumphantly, and they skirted the
crowd and came round on the side towards the sands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) could think of, military and civil, to which Anne returned
pretty syllables and parenthetic words about the colour of the sea and
the curl of the foam--a way of speaking that moved the soldier's heart
even more than long and direct speeches would have done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And that other thing I asked you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) ventured to say at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We won't speak of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't dislike me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, gazing at the bathing-machines, digging children, and
other common objects of the seashore, as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) interest lay there rather
than with him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am not worthy of the daughter of a genteel professional man--that's
what you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's something more than worthiness required in such cases, you
know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, still without calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mind away from surrounding
scenes. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, there are the Queen and princesses at the window!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, since you will make me speak, I mean the woman ought to love the
man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The trumpet-major seemed to be less concerned about this than about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
supposed superiority. <div class="bookquote">``If it were all right on that point, would you
mind the other?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) asked, like a man who knows he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) is too persistent, yet
who cannot be still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I say, when I don't know? What a pretty chip hat the elder
princess wears?''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) companion's general disappointment extended over him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) almost to his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
lace and his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) plume. ``Your mother said, you know, Miss Anne--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's the worst of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Let us go back to David; I
have seen all I want to see, Mr. Loveday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div><p/>The mass of the people had by this time noticed the Queen and princesses
at the window, and raised a cheer, to which the ladies waved their
embroidered handkerchiefs. Anne went back towards the pavement with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
trumpet-major, whom all the girls envied her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), so fine-looking a soldier
was he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>); and not only for that, but because it was well known that he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) was
not a soldier from necessity, but from patriotism, his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) father having
repeatedly offered to set him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) up in business: his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) artistic taste in
preferring a horse and uniform to a dirty, rumbling flour-mill was
admired by all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), too, had a very nice appearance in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) best clothes
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) walked along--the sarcenet hat, muslin shawl, and tight-sleeved
gown being of the newest Overcombe fashion, that was only about a year
old in the adjoining town, and in London three or four. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not be
harsh to Loveday and dismiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) curtly, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) musical pursuits had
refined him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>), educated him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>), and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) quite poetical. To-day he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had
been particularly well-mannered and tender; so, instead of answering,
<div class="bookquote">``Never speak to me like this again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) merely put him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) off with a <div class="bookquote">``Let
us go back to David.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>When they reached the place where they had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) David was gone.

<p/>Anne was now positively vexed. <div class="bookquote">``What _shall_ I do?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>)'s only gone to drink the King's health,''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Loveday, who had
privately given David the money for performing that operation. <div class="bookquote">``Depend
upon it, he (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>)'ll be back soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you go and find him (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), with intense propriety in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) looks
and tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Loveday reluctantly; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) went.

<p/>Anne stood still. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could now escape her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) gallant friend, for, although
the distance was long, it was not impossible to walk home. On the other
hand, Loveday was a good and sincere fellow, for whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had almost a
brotherly feeling, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) shrank from such a trick. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) stood and
mused, scarcely heeding the music, the marching of the soldiers, the
King, the dukes, the brilliant staff, the attendants, and the happy
groups of people, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes fell upon the ground.

<p/>Before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw a flower lying--a crimson sweet-william--fresh and
uninjured. An instinctive wish to save it from destruction by the
passengers' feet led her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to pick it up; and then, moved by a sudden self-
consciousness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) looked around. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was standing before an inn, and
from an upper window Festus Derriman was leaning with two or three
kindred spirits of his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) cut and kind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) nodded eagerly, and signified to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) had thrown the flower.

<p/>What should she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) do? To throw it away would seem stupid, and to keep it
was awkward. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) held it between her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) finger and thumb, twirled it round
on its axis and twirled it back again, regarding and yet not examining
it. Just then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw the trumpet-major coming back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't find David anywhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) said; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) heart was not sorry as he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>)
said it.

<p/>Anne was still holding out the sweet-william as if about to drop it, and,
scarcely knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did under the distressing sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was
watched, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) offered the flower to Loveday.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) face brightened with pleasure as he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) took it. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
said.

<p/>Then Anne saw what a misleading blunder she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had committed towards Loveday
in playing to the yeoman. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had sown the seeds of a quarrel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not my sweet-william,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said hastily; `it was lying on the
ground. I don't mean anything by giving it to you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I'll keep it all the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>said the innocent soldier, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) knew
a good deal about womankind; and he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) put the flower carefully inside his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
jacket, between his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) white waistcoat and his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) heart.

<p/>Festus, seeing this, enlarged himself wrathfully, got hot in the face,
rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) feet, and glared down upon them like a turnip-lantern.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne timorously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll see you safe to your own door, depend upon me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Loveday.
<div class="bookquote">``But--I had near forgot--there's father's letter, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s so anxiously
waiting for! Will you come with me to the post-office? Then I'll take
you straight home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne, expecting Festus to pounce down every minute, was glad to be off
anywhere; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) accepted the suggestion, and they went along the parade
together.

<p/>Loveday set this down as a proof of Anne's relenting. Thus in joyful
spirits he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) entered the office, paid the postage, and received the letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is from Bob, after all!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Father told me to read it at
once, in case of bad news. Ask your pardon for keeping you a moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
broke the seal and read, Anne standing silently by.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) is coming home _to be married_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said the trumpet-major, without
looking up.

<p/>Anne did not answer. The blood swept impetuously up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face at his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
words, and as suddenly went away again, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) rather paler than
before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) disguised her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) agitation and then overcame it, Loveday
observing nothing of this emotional performance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As far as I can understand he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) will be here Saturday,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne quite calmly. <div class="bookquote">``And who is he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) going to marry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John, turning the letter about. <div class="bookquote">``The woman is
a stranger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment the miller entered the office hastily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, John,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``I have been waiting and waiting for that there
letter till I was nigh crazy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>John briefly explained the news, and when his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father had recovered from
his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) astonishment, taken off his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hat, and wiped the exact line where his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
forehead joined his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hair, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) walked with Anne up the street, leaving John
to return alone. The miller was so absorbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) mental perspective of
Bob's marriage, that he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) saw nothing of the gaieties they passed through;
and Anne seemed also so much impressed by the same intelligence, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
crossed before the inn occupied by Festus without showing a recollection
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) presence there.




<p/>XIV. LATER IN THE EVENING OF THE SAME DAY


<p/>When they reached home the sun was going down. It had already been
noised abroad that miller Loveday had received a letter, and, his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) cart
having been heard coming up the lane, the population of Overcombe drew
down towards the mill as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had gone indoors--a sudden flash of
brightness from the window showing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had struck such an early light
as nothing but the immediate deciphering of literature could require.
Letters were matters of public moment, and everybody in the parish had an
interest in the reading of those rare documents; so that when the miller
had placed the candle, slanted himself, and called in Mrs. Garland to
have her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) opinion on the meaning of any hieroglyphics that he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) might
encounter in his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) course, he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) was to be additionally assisted
by the opinions of the other neighbours, whose persons appeared in the
doorway, partly covering each other like a hand of cards, yet each
showing a large enough piece of himself for identification. To pass the
time while they were arranging themselves, the miller adopted his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) usual
way of filling up casual intervals, that of snuffing the candle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We heard you had got a letter, Maister Loveday,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they said.

<p/>``Yes; <div class="bookquote">``Southampton, the twelfth of August, dear father,'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>' said Loveday;
and they were as silent as relations at the reading of a will. Anne, for
whom the letter had a singular fascination, came in with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother and
sat down.

<p/>Bob stated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) own way that having, since landing, taken into
consideration his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father's wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) should renounce a seafaring life
and become a partner in the mill, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had decided to agree to the
proposal; and with that object in view he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) would return to Overcombe in
three days from the time of writing.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) then said incidentally that since his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) voyage he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had been in lodgings
at Southampton, and during that time had become acquainted with a lovely
and virtuous young maiden, in whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) found the exact qualities necessary
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) happiness. Having known this lady for the full space of a
fortnight he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had had ample opportunities of studying her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) character, and,
being struck with the recollection that, if there was one thing more than
another necessary in a mill which had no mistress, it was somebody who
could play that part with grace and dignity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had asked Miss Matilda
Johnson to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) wife. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) kindness she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>), though sacrificing far
better prospects, had agreed; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) could not but regard it as a happy
chance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) should have found at the nick of time such a woman to
adorn his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) home, whose innocence was as stunning as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) beauty. Without
much ado, therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had arranged to be married at once, and
at Overcombe, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father might not be deprived of the pleasures of
the wedding feast. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had kindly consented to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) by land in the
course of a few days, and to live in the house as their guest for the
week or so previous to the ceremony.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis a proper good letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>guest</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Comfort from the background. <div class="bookquote">``I
never heerd true love better put out of hand in my life; and they seem
`nation fond of one another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) haven't knowed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) such a very long time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Job Mitchell</b></font>)</div>said Job Mitchell
dubiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther</b></font>)</div>said Esther Beach. <div class="bookquote">``Nater will find her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way, very
rapid when the time's come for`t. Well, `tis good news for ye, miller.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes, sure, I hope <div class="bookquote">``tis,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Loveday, without, however, showing any
great hurry to burst into the frantic form of fatherly joy which the
event should naturally have produced, seeming more disposed to let off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) feelings by examining thoroughly into the fibres of the letter-paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was five years a-courting my wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) presently remarked. <div class="bookquote">``But folks
were slower about everything in them days. Well, since she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s coming we
must make her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) welcome. Did any of ye catch by my reading which day it is
he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) means? What with making out the penmanship, my mind was drawn off
from the sense here and there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) says in three days,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garland. <div class="bookquote">``The date of the letter will
fix it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>On examination it was found that the day appointed was the one nearly
expired; at which the miller jumped up and said, <div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>)'ll be here
before bedtime. I didn't gather till now that he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) was coming afore
Saturday. Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) may drop in this very minute!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) had scarcely spoken when footsteps were heard coming along the front,
and they presently halted at the door. Loveday pushed through the
neighbours and rushed out; and, seeing in the passage a form which
obscured the declining light, the miller seized hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>), saying, <div class="bookquote">``O
my dear Bob; then you are come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Scrounch it all, miller, don't quite pull my poor shoulder out of joint!
Whatever is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>the new-comer</b></font>)</div>said the new-comer, trying to release himself
from Loveday's grasp of affection. It was Uncle Benjy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thought 'twas my son!''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>faltered the miller, sinking back upon the toes
of the neighbours who had closely followed him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) into the entry. <div class="bookquote">``Well,
come in, Mr. Derriman, and make yerself at home. Why, you haven't been
here for years! Whatever has made you come now, sir, of all times in the
world?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) in there with ye?''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>whispered the farmer with misgiving.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My nephew, after that maid that he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)'s so mighty smit with?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no; he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) never calls here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Farmer</b></font>)</div><p/>Farmer Derriman breathed a breath of relief. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I've called to tell
ye,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) said, `that there's more news of the French. We shall have 'em
here this month as sure as a gun. The gunboats be all ready--near two
thousand of 'em--and the whole army is at Boulogne. And, miller, I know
ye to be an honest man.''

<p/>Loveday did not say nay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Neighbour Loveday, I know ye to be an honest man,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeated the old
squireen. <div class="bookquote">``Can I speak to ye alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div><p/>As the house was full, Loveday took him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) into the garden, all the while
upon tenter-hooks, not lest Buonaparte should appear in their midst, but
lest Bob should come whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was not there to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>). When they
had got into a corner Uncle Benjy said, <div class="bookquote">``Miller, what with the French,
and what with my nephew Festus, I assure ye my life is nothing but
wherrit from morning to night. Miller Loveday, you are an honest man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Benjy/Uncle Benjy</b></font>)</div><p/>Loveday nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I've come to ask a favour--to ask if you will take charge of my
few poor title-deeds and documents and suchlike, while I am away from
home next week, lest anything should befall me, and they should be stole
away by Boney or Festus, and I should have nothing left in the wide
world? I can trust neither banks nor lawyers in these terrible times;
and I am come to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div><p/>Loveday after some hesitation agreed to take care of anything that
Derriman should bring, whereupon the farmer said he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) would call with the
parchments and papers alluded to in the course of a week. Derriman then
went away by the garden gate, mounted his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) pony, which had been tethered
outside, and rode on till his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) form was lost in the shades.

<p/>The miller rejoined his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) friends, and found that in the meantime John had
arrived. John informed the company that after parting from his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father
and Anne he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had rambled to the harbour, and discovered the Pewit by the
quay. On inquiry he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had learnt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) came in at eleven o'clock, and
that Bob had gone ashore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll go and meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Boney</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller. <div class="bookquote">''`Tis still light out of
doors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div><p/>So, as the dew rose from the meads and formed fleeces in the hollows,
Loveday and his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) friends and neighbours strolled out, and loitered by the
stiles which hampered the footpath from Overcombe to the high road at
intervals of a hundred yards. John Loveday, being obliged to return to
camp, was unable to accompany them, but Widow Garland thought proper to
fall in with the procession. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) bonnet she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) called
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) daughter. Anne said from upstairs that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was coming in a
minute; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother walked on without her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/>What was Anne doing? Having hastily unlocked a receptacle for emotional
objects of small size, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) took thence the little folded paper with which
we have already become acquainted, and, striking a light from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) private
tinder-box, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) held the paper, and curl of hair it contained, in the
candle till they were burnt. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hat and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
mother and the rest of them across the moist grey fields, cheerfully
singing in an undertone as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went, to assure herself of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
indifference to circumstances.




<p/>XV. ``CAPTAIN' BOB LOVEDAY OF THE MERCHANT SERVICE


<p/>While Loveday and his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) neighbours were thus rambling forth, full of
expectancy, some of them, including Anne in the rear, heard the crackling
of light wheels along the curved lane to which the path was the chord. At
once Anne thought, <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps that's he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>), and we are missing him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>But
recent events were not of a kind to induce her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to say anything; and the
others of the company did not reflect on the sound.

<p/>Had they gone across to the hedge which hid the lane, and looked through
it, they would have seen a light cart driven by a boy, beside whom was
seated a seafaring man, apparently of good standing in the merchant
service, with his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) feet outside on the shaft. The vehicle went over the
main bridge, turned in upon the other bridge at the tail of the mill, and
halted by the door. The sailor alighted, showing himself to be a well-
shaped, active, and fine young man, with a bright eye, an anonymous nose,
and of such a rich complexion by exposure to ripening suns that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might
have been some connexion of the foreigner who calls his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likeness the
Portrait of a Gentleman in galleries of the Old Masters. Yet in spite of
this, and though Bob Loveday had been all over the world from Cape Horn
to Pekin, and from India's coral strand to the White Sea, the most
conspicuous of all the marks that he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) had brought back with him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) was an
increased resemblance to his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) mother, who had lain all the time beneath
Overcombe church wall.

<p/>Captain Loveday tried the house door; finding this locked he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) went to the
mill door: this was locked also, the mill being stopped for the night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are not at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) said to the boy. <div class="bookquote">``But never mind that. Just
help to unload the things and then I'll pay you, and you can drive off
home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The cart was unloaded, and the boy was dismissed, thanking the sailor
profusely for the payment rendered. Then Bob Loveday, finding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
had still some leisure on his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) hands, looked musingly east, west, north,
south, and nadir; after which he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) bestirred himself by carrying his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) goods,
article by article, round to the back door, out of the way of casual
passers. This done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) walked round the mill in a more regardful
attitude, and surveyed its familiar features one by one--the panes of the
grinding-room, now as heretofore clouded with flour as with stale hoar-
frost; the meal lodged in the corners of the window-sills, forming a soil
in which lichens grew without ever getting any bigger, as they had done
since his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) smallest infancy; the mosses on the plinth towards the river,
reaching as high as the capillary power of the walls would fetch up
moisture for their nourishment, and the penned mill-pond, now as ever on
the point of overflowing into the garden. Everything was the same.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had had enough of this it occurred to Loveday that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) might get
into the house in spite of the locked doors; and by entering the garden,
placing a pole from the fork of an apple-tree to the window-sill of a
bedroom on that side, and climbing across like a Barbary ape, he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) entered
the window and stepped down inside. There was something anomalous in
being close to the familiar furniture without having first seen his (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>)
father, and its silent, impassive shine was not cheering; it was as if
his (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) relations were all dead, and only their tables and chests of drawers
left to greet him (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) went downstairs and seated himself in the dark
parlour. Finding this place, too, rather solitary, and the tick of the
invisible clock preternaturally loud, he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) unearthed the tinder-box,
obtained a light, and set about making the house comfortable for his (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>)
father's return, divining that the miller had gone out to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) by the
wrong road.

<p/>Robert's interest in this work increased as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) proceeded, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) bustled
round and round the kitchen as lightly as a girl. David, the indoor
factotum, having lost himself among the quart pots of Budmouth, there had
been nobody left here to prepare supper, and Bob had it all to himself.
In a short time a fire blazed up the chimney, a tablecloth was found, the
plates were clapped down, and a search made for what provisions the house
afforded, which, in addition to various meats, included some fresh eggs
of the elongated shape that produces cockerels when hatched, and had been
set aside on that account for putting under the next broody hen.

<p/>A more reckless cracking of eggs than that which now went on had never
been known in Overcombe since the last large christening; and as Loveday
gashed one on the side, another at the end, another longways, and another
diagonally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) acquired adroitness by practice, and at last made every
son of a hen of them fall into two hemispheres as neatly as if it opened
by a hinge. From eggs he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) proceeded to ham, and from ham to kidneys, the
result being a brilliant fry.

<p/>Not to be tempted to fall to before his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) father came back, the returned
navigator emptied the whole into a dish, laid a plate over the top, his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
coat over the plate, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) hat over his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) coat. Thus completely stopping
in the appetizing smell, he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) sat down to await events. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) was relieved
from the tediousness of doing this by hearing voices outside; and in a
minute his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) father entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Glad to welcome ye home, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob. <div class="bookquote">``And supper is just ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lard, lard--why, Captain Bob's here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garland.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And we've been out waiting to meet thee!''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller, as he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) entered
the room, followed by representatives of the houses of Cripplestraw,
Comfort, Mitchell, Beach, and Snooks, together with some small beginnings
of Fencible Tremlett's posterity. In the rear came David, and quite in
the vanishing-point of the composition, Anne the fair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I drove over; and so was forced to come by the road,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And we went across the fields, thinking you'd walk,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have been here this morning; but not so much as a wheelbarrow
could I get for my traps; everything was gone to the review. So I went
too, thinking I might meet you there. I was then obliged to return to
the harbour for the luggage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>Then there was a welcoming of Captain Bob by pulling out his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) arms like
drawers and shutting them again, smacking him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) on the back as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) were
choking, holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) at arm's length as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) were of too large type to
read close. All which persecution Bob bore with a wide, genial smile
that was shaken into fragments and scattered promiscuously among the
spectators.

<p/>``Get a chair for <div class="bookquote">``n!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the miller to David, whom they had met in the
fields and found to have got nothing worse by his (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) absence than a slight
slant in his (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) walk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind--I am not tired--I have been here ever so long,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob.
``And I--' But the chair having been placed behind him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), and a smart touch
in the hollow of a person's knee by the edge of that piece of furniture
having a tendency to make the person sit without further argument, Bob
sank down dumb, and the others drew up other chairs at a convenient
nearness for easy analytic vision and the subtler forms of good
fellowship. The miller went about saying, ``David, the nine best glasses
from the corner cupboard!<div class="bookquote">''--`David, the corkscrew!'' (<font color='red'><b>David</b></font>)</div>--`David, whisk the
tail of thy smock-frock round the inside of these quart pots afore you
draw drink in 'em--they be an inch thick in dust!<div class="bookquote">''--`David, lower that
chimney-crook a couple of notches that the flame may touch the bottom of
the kettle, and light three more of the largest candles!'' (<font color='red'><b>David</b></font>)</div>--`If you can't
get the cork out of the jar, David, bore a hole in the tub of Hollands
that's buried under the scroff in the fuel-house; d'ye hear?--Dan Brown
left en there yesterday as a return for the little porker I gied en.''

<p/>When they had all had a thimbleful round, and the superfluous neighbours
had reluctantly departed, one by one, the inmates gave their minds to the
supper, which David had begun to serve up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What be you rolling back the tablecloth for, David?''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maister Bob have put down one of the under sheets by mistake, and I
thought you might not like it, sir, as there's ladies present!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Faith, 'twas the first thing that came to hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Robert. <div class="bookquote">``It
seemed a tablecloth to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind--don't pull off the things now he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s laid 'em down--let it
bide,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller. <div class="bookquote">``But where's Widow Garland and Maidy Anne?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They were here but a minute ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>David</b></font>)</div>said David. <div class="bookquote">``Depend upon it they have
slinked off 'cause they be shy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The miller</b></font>)</div><p/>The miller at once went round to ask them to come back and sup with him (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>);
and while he (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) was gone David told Bob in confidence what an excellent
place he (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) had for an old man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Cap'n Bob, as I suppose I must call ye; I've worked for yer father
these eight-and-thirty years, and we have always got on very well
together. Trusts me with all the keys, lends me his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sleeve-waistcoat,
and leaves the house entirely to me. Widow Garland next door, too, is
just the same with me, and treats me as if I was her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) own child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) must have married young to make you that, David.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes, yes--I'm years older than she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Tis only my common way of
speaking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Garland would not come in to supper, and the meal proceeded without
her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>), Bob recommending to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father the dish he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had cooked, in the manner
of a householder to a stranger just come. The miller was anxious to know
more about his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) son's plans for the future, but would not for the present
interrupt his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) eating, looking up from his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) own plate to appreciate Bob's
travelled way of putting English victuals out of sight, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) would have
looked at a mill on improved principles.

<p/>David had only just got the table clear, and set the plates in a row
under the bakehouse table for the cats to lick, when the door was hastily
opened, and Mrs. Garland came in, looking concerned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been waiting to hear the plates removed to tell you how
frightened we are at something we hear at the back-door. It seems like
robbers muttering; but when I look out there's nobody there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This must be seen to,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller, rising promptly. <div class="bookquote">``David, light
the middle-sized lantern. I'll go and search the garden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'll go too,''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) son, taking up a cudgel. <div class="bookquote">``Lucky I've come
home just in time!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the widow Anne</b></font>)</div><p/>They went out stealthily, followed by the widow and Anne, who had been
afraid to stay alone in the house under the circumstances. No sooner
were they beyond the door when, sure enough, there was the muttering
almost close at hand, and low upon the ground, as from persons lying down
in hiding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless my heart!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob, striking his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) head as though it were some
enemy's: `why, `tis my luggage. I'd quite forgot it!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father.

<p/>``My luggage. Really, if it hadn't been for Mrs. Garland it would have
stayed there all night, and they, poor things! would have been starved.
I've got all sorts of articles for ye. You go inside, and I'll bring 'em
in. <div class="bookquote">``Tis parrots that you hear a muttering, Mrs. Garland. You needn't
be afraid any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Parrots?''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm glad `tis no worse. But how
couldst forget so, Bob?''

 (<font color='red'><b>David</b></font>)</div><p/>The packages were taken in by David and Bob, and the first unfastened
were three, wrapped in cloths, which being stripped off revealed three
cages, with a gorgeous parrot in each.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This one is for you, father, to hang up outside the door, and amuse us,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll talk very well, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s sleepy to-night. This other
one I brought along for any neighbour that would like to have him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
colours are not so bright; but `tis a good bird. If you would like to
have him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) you are welcome to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said, turning to Anne, who had been
tempted forward by the birds. <div class="bookquote">``You have hardly spoken yet, Miss Anne,
but I recollect you very well. How much taller you have got, to be
sure!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was much obliged, but did not know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could do with
such a present. Mrs. Garland accepted it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>), and the sailor went
on--<div class="bookquote">``Now this other bird I hardly know what to do with; but I dare say
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll come in for something or other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the sailor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is by far the prettiest,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow. <div class="bookquote">``I would rather have it
than the other, if you don't mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob, with embarrassment. <div class="bookquote">``But the fact is, that bird will
hardly do for ye, ma'am. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s a hard swearer, to tell the truth; and I
am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s too old to be broken of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How dreadful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garland.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We could keep him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in the mill,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>suggested the miller. <div class="bookquote">``It won't matter
about the grinder hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) can't learn to cuss worse than he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
do already!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The grinder shall have him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob. <div class="bookquote">``The one I have given you,
ma'am, has no harm in him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) at all. You might take him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to church o'
Sundays as far as that goes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The sailor</b></font>)</div><p/>The sailor now untied a small wooden box about a foot square, perforated
with holes. <div class="bookquote">``Here are two marmosets,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``You can't see them
to-night; but they are beauties--the tufted sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's a marmoset?''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller.

<p/>``O, a little kind of monkey. They bite strangers rather hard, but you'll
soon get used to <div class="bookquote">``em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are wrapped up in something, I declare,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garland, peeping
in through a chink.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's my flannel shirt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob apologetically. <div class="bookquote">``They suffer
terribly from cold in this climate, poor things! and I had nothing better
to give them. Well, now, in this next box I've got things of different
sorts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a seaman</b></font>)</div><p/>The latter was a regular seaman's chest, and out of it he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) produced shells
of many sizes and colours, carved ivories, queer little caskets, gorgeous
feathers, and several silk handkerchiefs, which articles were spread out
upon all the available tables and chairs till the house began to look
like a bazaar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a lovely shawl!''  (<font color='red'><b>Widow Garland</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Widow Garland, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) interest
forestalling the regular exhibition by looking into the box at what was
coming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mate</b></font>)</div>said the mate, pulling out a couple of the most bewitching
shawls that eyes ever saw. <div class="bookquote">``One of these I am going to give to that
young lady I am shortly to be married to, you know, Mrs. Garland. Has
father told you about it? Matilda Johnson, of Southampton, that's her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>)
name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, we know all about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I shall give one of these shawls to her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>)--because, of course, I
ought to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the other one I've got no use for at all; and,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) continued,
looking round, `will you have it, Miss Anne? You refused the parrot, and
you ought not to refuse this.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne calmly, but much distressed; `but really I don't
want it, and couldn't take it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But do have it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob in hurt tones, Mrs. Garland being all the
while on tenter-hooks lest Anne should persist in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) absurd refusal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, there's another reason why you ought to!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) face
lighting up with recollections. <div class="bookquote">``It never came into my head till this
moment that I used to be your beau in a humble sort of way. Faith, so I
did, and we used to meet at places sometimes, didn't we--that is, when
you were not too proud; and once I gave you, or somebody else, a bit of
my hair in fun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was somebody else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, perhaps it was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob innocently. <div class="bookquote">``But it was you I used to
meet, or try to, I am sure. Well, I've never thought of that boyish time
for years till this minute! I am sure you ought to accept some one gift,
dear, out of compliment to those old times!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne drew back and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would not trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mrs. Garland, then you shall have it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob, tossing the shawl
to that ready receiver. <div class="bookquote">``If you don't, upon my life I will throw it out
to the first beggar I see. Now, here's a parcel of cap ribbons of the
splendidest sort I could get. Have these--do, Anne!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garland.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I promised them to Matilda,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>continued Bob; `but I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) won't
want 'em, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) has got some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) own: and I would as soon see them
upon your head, my dear, as upon hers.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you had better keep them for your bride if you have promised
them to her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garland mildly.

<p/>``It wasn't exactly a promise. I just said, ``Til, there's some cap
ribbons in my box, if you would like to have them.<div class="bookquote">'' But she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>)'s got enough
things already for any bride in creation. Anne, now you shall have
'em--upon my soul you shall--or I'll fling them down the mill-tail!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne had meant to be perfectly firm in refusing everything, for reasons
obvious even to that poor waif, the meanest capacity; but when it came to
this point she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was absolutely compelled to give in, and reluctantly
received the cap ribbons in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) arms, blushing fitfully, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lip
trembling in a motion which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tried to exhibit as a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What would Tilly say if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilly</b></font>) knew!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the miller slily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed--and it is wrong of him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>Anne instantly cried, tears
running down her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) threw the parcel of ribbons on the floor.
<div class="bookquote">``You'd better bestow your gifts where you bestow your l--l--love, Mr.
Loveday--that's what I say!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>And Anne turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) back and went away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll take them for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilly</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garland, quickly picking up the
parcel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now that's a pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob, looking regretfully after Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't
remember that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilly</b></font>) was a quick-tempered sort of girl at all. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilly</b></font>),
Mrs. Garland, that I ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) pardon. But of course I didn't know she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) was
too proud to accept a little present--how should I? Upon my life if it
wasn't for Matilda I'd--Well, that can't be, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garland, touching with her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) foot a large package
that had been laid down by Bob unseen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a bit of baccy for myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Robert meekly.

<p/>The examination of presents at last ended, and the two families parted
for the night. When they were alone, Mrs. Garland said to Anne, <div class="bookquote">``What a
close girl you are! I am sure I never knew that Bob Loveday and you had
walked together: you must have been mere children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes--so we were,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, now quite recovered. <div class="bookquote">``It was when we
first came here, about a year after father died. We did not walk
together in any regular way. You know I have never thought the Lovedays
high enough for me. It was only just--nothing at all, and I had almost
forgotten it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div><p/>It is to be hoped that somebody's sins were forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) that night
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went to bed.

<p/>When Bob and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father were left alone, the miller said, <div class="bookquote">``Well, Robert,
about this young woman of thine--Matilda what's her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father--Matilda Johnson. I was just going to tell ye about her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>The miller</b></font>)</div><p/>The miller nodded, and sipped his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) mug.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) is an excellent body,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>continued Bob; `that can truly be
said--a real charmer, you know--a nice good comely young woman, a miracle
of genteel breeding, you know, and all that. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can throw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair into
the nicest curls, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s got splendid gowns and headclothes. In
short, you might call her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a land mermaid. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll make such a first-rate
wife as there never was.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) will,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller; `for I have never known thee
wanting in sense in a jineral way.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) cup round on its axis
till the handle had travelled a complete circle. <div class="bookquote">``How long did you say
in your letter that you had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A fortnight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not _very_ long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It don't sound long, `tis true; and 'twas really longer--'twas fifteen
days and a quarter. But hang it, father, I could see in the twinkling of
an eye that the girl would do. I know a woman well enough when I see
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--I ought to, indeed, having been so much about the world. Now, for
instance, there's Widow Garland and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) daughter. The girl is a nice
little thing; but the old woman--O no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>Bob shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father, slightly shifting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s--I mean, I should never have chose her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), you know.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s of a nice disposition, and young for a widow with a grown-up
daughter; but if all the men had been like me she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would never have had a
husband. I like her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) in some respects; but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s a style of beauty I
don't care for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, if `tis only looks you are thinking of,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller, much
relieved, `there's nothing to be said, of course. Though there's many a
duchess worse-looking, if it comes to argument, as you would find, my
son,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) added, with a sense of having been mollified too soon.

<p/>The mate's thoughts were elsewhere by this time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to my marrying Matilda, thinks I, here's one of the very genteelest
sort, and I may as well do the job at once. So I chose her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>)'s a
dear girl; there's nobody like her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>), search where you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How many did you choose her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) out from?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>inquired his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) was the only young woman I happened to know in Southampton,
that's true. But what of that? It would have been all the same if I had
known a hundred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) father is in business near the docks, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, no. In short, I didn't see her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) mother? No, I didn't. I think her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) mother is dead; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) has got
a very rich aunt living at Melchester. I didn't see her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) aunt, because
there wasn't time to go; but of course we shall know her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) when we are
married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller, trying to feel quite satisfied.
<div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) will soon be here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>)'s coming soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) has gone to this aunt's at
Melchester to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) things packed, and suchlike, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) would have come
with me. I am going to meet the coach at the King's Arms, Casterbridge,
on Sunday, at one o'clock. To show what a capital sort of wife she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'ll
be, I may tell you that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wanted to come by the Mercury, because `tis a
little cheaper than the other. But I said, ``For once in your life do it
well, and come by the Royal Mail, and I'll pay.<div class="bookquote">'' I can have the pony and
trap to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>), I suppose, as `tis too far for her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) to walk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you can, Bob, or anything else. And I'll do all I can to give
you a good wedding feast.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>XVI. THEY MAKE READY FOR THE ILLUSTRIOUS STRANGER


<p/>Preparations for Matilda's welcome, and for the event which was to
follow, at once occupied the attention of the mill. The miller and his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>)
man had but dim notions of housewifery on any large scale; so the great
wedding cleaning was kindly supervised by Mrs. Garland, Bob being mostly
away during the day with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) brother, the trumpet-major, on various
errands, one of which was to buy paint and varnish for the gig that
Matilda was to be fetched in, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had determined to decorate with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) own hands.

<p/>By the widow's direction the old familiar incrustation of shining dirt,
imprinted along the back of the settle by the heads of countless jolly
sitters, was scrubbed and scraped away; the brown circle round the nail
whereon the miller hung his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) hat, stained by the brim in wet weather, was
whitened over; the tawny smudges of bygone shoulders in the passage were
removed without regard to a certain genial and historical value which
they had acquired. The face of the clock, coated with verdigris as thick
as a diachylon plaister, was rubbed till the figures emerged into day;
while, inside the case of the same chronometer, the cobwebs that formed
triangular hammocks, which the pendulum could hardly wade through, were
cleared away at one swoop.

<p/>Mrs. Garland also assisted at the invasion of worm-eaten cupboards, where
layers of ancient smells lingered on in the stagnant air, and recalled to
the reflective nose the many good things that had been kept there. The
upper floors were scrubbed with such abundance of water that the
old-established death-watches, wood-lice, and flour-worms were all
drowned, the suds trickling down into the room below in so lively and
novel a manner as to convey the romantic notion that the miller lived in
a cave with dripping stalactites.

<p/>They moved what had never been moved before--the oak coffer, containing
the miller's wardrobe--a tremendous weight, what with its locks, hinges,
nails, dirt, framework, and the hard stratification of old jackets,
waistcoats, and knee-breeches at the bottom, never disturbed since the
miller's wife died, and half pulverized by the moths, whose flattened
skeletons lay amid the mass in thousands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It fairly makes my back open and shut!''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Loveday, as, in obedience
to Mrs. Garland's direction, he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) lifted one corner, the grinder and David
assisting at the others. <div class="bookquote">``All together: speak when ye be going to heave.
Now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The pot covers and skimmers were brought to such a state that, on
examining them, the beholder was not conscious of utensils, but of his (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>)
own face in a condition of hideous elasticity. The broken clock-line was
mended, the kettles rocked, the creeper nailed up, and a new handle put
to the warming-pan. The large household lantern was cleaned out, after
three years of uninterrupted accumulation, the operation yielding a
conglomerate of candle-snuffs, candle-ends, remains of matches,
lamp-black, and eleven ounces and a half of good grease--invaluable as
dubbing for skitty boots and ointment for cart-wheels.

<p/>Everybody said that the mill residence had not been so thoroughly scoured
for twenty years. The miller and David looked on with a sort of awe
tempered by gratitude, tacitly admitting by their gaze that this was
beyond what they had ever thought of. Mrs. Garland supervised all with
disinterested benevolence. It would never have done, she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) said, for his (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>)
future daughter-in-law to see the house in its original state. She (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) would
have taken a dislike to him (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>), and perhaps to Bob likewise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't ye come and live here with me, and then you would be able to
see to it at all times?''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller as she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) bustled about again. To
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) answered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) was considering the matter, and might in good
time. He (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) had previously informed her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) plan was to put Bob and
his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) wife in the part of the house that she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>), Mrs. Garland, occupied, as
soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) chose to enter his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>), which relieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) of any fear of being
incommoded by Matilda.

<p/>The cooking for the wedding festivities was on a proportionate scale of
thoroughness. They killed the four supernumerary chickens that had just
begun to crow, and the little curly-tailed barrow pig, in preference to
the sow; not having been put up fattening for more than five weeks it was
excellent small meat, and therefore more delicate and likely to suit a
town-bred lady's taste than the large one, which, having reached the
weight of fourteen score, might have been a little gross to a cultured
palate. There were also provided a cold chine, stuffed veal, and two
pigeon pies. Also thirty rings of black-pot, a dozen of white-pot, and
ten knots of tender and well-washed chitterlings, cooked plain in case
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should like a change.

<p/>As additional reserves there were sweetbreads, and five milts, sewed up
at one side in the form of a chrysalis, and stuffed with thyme, sage,
parsley, mint, groats, rice, milk, chopped egg, and other ingredients.
They were afterwards roasted before a slow fire, and eaten hot.

<p/>The business of chopping so many herbs for the various stuffings was
found to be aching work for women; and David, the miller, the grinder,
and the grinder's boy being fully occupied in their proper branches, and
Bob being very busy painting the gig and touching up the harness, Loveday
called in a friendly dragoon of John's regiment who was passing by, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>), being a muscular man, willingly chopped all the afternoon for a quart
of strong, judiciously administered, and all other victuals found, taking
off his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) jacket and gloves, rolling up his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) shirt-sleeves and unfastening
his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) collar in an honourable and energetic way.

<p/>All windfalls and maggot-cored codlins were excluded from the apple pies;
and as there was no known dish large enough for the purpose, the puddings
were stirred up in the milking-pail, and boiled in the three-legged bell-
metal crock, of great weight and antiquity, which every travelling tinker
for the previous thirty years had tapped with his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) stick, coveted, made a
bid for, and often attempted to steal.

<p/>In the liquor line Loveday laid in an ample barrel of Casterbridge
`strong beer.'' This renowned drink--now almost as much a thing of the
past as Falstaff's favourite beverage--was not only well calculated to
win the hearts of soldiers blown dry and dusty by residence in tents on a
hill-top, but of any wayfarer whatever in that land. It was of the most
beautiful colour that the eye of an artist in beer could desire; full in
body, yet brisk as a volcano; piquant, yet without a twang; luminous as
an autumn sunset; free from streakiness of taste; but, finally, rather
heady. The masses worshipped it, the minor gentry loved it more than
wine, and by the most illustrious county families it was not despised.
Anybody brought up for being drunk and disorderly in the streets of its
natal borough, had only to prove that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) was a stranger to the place and
its liquor to be honourably dismissed by the magistrates, as one
overtaken in a fault that no man could guard against who entered the town
unawares.

<p/>In addition, Mr. Loveday also tapped a hogshead of fine cider that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had
had mellowing in the house for several months, having bought it of an
honest down-country man, who did not colour, for any special occasion
like the present. It had been pressed from fruit judiciously chosen by
an old hand--Horner and Cleeves apple for the body, a few Tom-Putts for
colour, and just a dash of Old Five-corners for sparkle--a selection
originally made to please the palate of a well-known temperate earl who
was a regular cider-drinker, and lived to be eighty-eight.

<p/>On the morning of the Sunday appointed for her (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) coming Captain Bob Loveday
set out to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) bride. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had been all the week engaged in painting
the gig, assisted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) brother at odd times, and it now appeared of a
gorgeous yellow, with blue streaks, and tassels at the corners, and red
wheels outlined with a darker shade. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) put in the pony at half-past
eleven, Anne looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) from the door as he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) packed himself into the
vehicle and drove off. There may be young women who look out at young
men driving to meet their brides as Anne looked at Captain Bob, and yet
are quite indifferent to the circumstances; but they are not often met
with.

<p/>So much dust had been raised on the highway by traffic resulting from the
presence of the Court at the town further on, that brambles hanging from
the fence, and giving a friendly scratch to the wanderer's face, were
dingy as church cobwebs; and the grass on the margin had assumed a paper-
shaving hue. Bob's father had wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) to take David, lest, from want
of recent experience at the whip, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) should meet with any mishap; but,
picturing to himself the awkwardness of three in such circumstances, Bob
would not hear of this; and nothing more serious happened to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) driving
than that the wheel-marks formed two serpentine lines along the road
during the first mile or two, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had got his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) hand in, and that the
horse shied at a milestone, a piece of paper, a sleeping tramp, and a
wheelbarrow, just to make use of the opportunity of being in bad hands.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) entered Casterbridge between twelve and one, and, putting up at the
Old Greyhound, walked on to the Bow. Here, rather dusty on the ledges of
his (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) clothes, he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) stood and waited while the people in their best summer
dresses poured out of the three churches round him (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>). When they had all
gone, and a smell of cinders and gravy had spread down the ancient high-
street, and the pie-dishes from adjacent bakehouses had all travelled
past, he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) saw the mail coach rise above the arch of Grey's Bridge, a
quarter of a mile distant, surmounted by swaying knobs, which proved to
be the heads of the outside travellers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the way for a man's bride to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Robert to himself
with a feeling of poetry; and as the horn sounded and the horses
clattered up the street he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) walked down to the inn. The knot of hostlers
and inn-servants had gathered, the horses were dragged from the vehicle,
and the passengers for Casterbridge began to descend. Captain Bob eyed
them over, looked inside, looked outside again; to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) disappointment
Matilda was not there, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) boxes, nor anything that was hers. Neither
coachman nor guard had seen or heard of such a person at Melchester; and
Bob walked slowly away.

<p/>Depressed by forebodings to an extent which took away nearly a third of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) appetite, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) sat down in the parlour of the Old Greyhound to a slice
from the family joint of the landlord. This gentleman, who dined in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
shirt-sleeves, partly because it was August, and partly from a sense that
they would not be so fit for public view further on in the week,
suggested that Bob should wait till three or four that afternoon, when
the road-waggon would arrive, as the lost lady might have preferred that
mode of conveyance; and when Bob appeared rather hurt at the suggestion,
the landlord's wife assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), as a woman who knew good life, that many
genteel persons travelled in that way during the present high price of
provisions. Loveday, who knew little of travelling by land, readily
accepted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) assurance and resolved to wait.

<p/>Wandering up and down the pavement, or leaning against some hot wall
between the waggon-office and the corner of the street above, he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) passed
the time away. It was a still, sunny, drowsy afternoon, and scarcely a
soul was visible in the length and breadth of the street. The office was
not far from All Saints' Church, and the church-windows being open, he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
could hear the afternoon service from where he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) lingered as distinctly as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had been one of the congregation. Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) was mentally conducted
through the Psalms, through the first and second lessons, through the
burst of fiddles and clarionets which announced the evening-hymn, and
well into the sermon, before any signs of the waggon could be seen upon
the London road.

<p/>The afternoon sermons at this church being of a dry and metaphysical
nature at that date, it was by a special providence that the
waggon-office was placed near the ancient fabric, so that whenever the
Sunday waggon was late, which it always was in hot weather, in cold
weather, in wet weather, and in weather of almost every other sort, the
rattle, dismounting, and swearing outside completely drowned the parson's
voice within, and sustained the flagging interest of the congregation at
precisely the right moment. No sooner did the charity children begin to
writhe on their benches, and adult snores grow audible, than the waggon
arrived.

<p/>Captain Loveday felt a kind of sinking in his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) poetry at the possibility
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) for whom they had made such preparations being in the slow,
unwieldy vehicle which crunched its way towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) would not
give in to the weakness. Neither would he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) walk down the street to meet
the waggon, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) should not be there. At last the broad wheels drew
up against the kerb, the waggoner with his (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>) white smock-frock, and whip as
long as a fishing-line, descended from the pony on which he (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>) rode
alongside, and the six broad-chested horses backed from their collars and
shook themselves. In another moment something showed forth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>) knew
that Matilda was there.

<p/>Bob felt three cheers rise within him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) stepped down; but it being
Sunday he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) did not utter them. In dress, Miss Johnson passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
expectations--a green and white gown, with long, tight sleeves, a green
silk handkerchief round her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) neck and crossed in front, a green parasol,
and green gloves. It was strange enough to see this verdant caterpillar
turn out of a road-waggon, and gracefully shake herself free from the
bits of straw and fluff which would usually gather on the raiment of the
grandest travellers by that vehicle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear Matilda,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) three times with
much publicity--the practical step he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had determined on seeming to demand
that these things should no longer be done in a corner--`my dear Matilda,
why didn't you come by the coach, having the money for't and all?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's my scrimping!''  (<font color='red'><b>Matilda/Miss Johnson/Matilda Johnson</b></font>)</div>said Matilda in a delightful gush. <div class="bookquote">``I know you
won't be offended when you know I did it to save against a rainy day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob, of course, was not offended, though the glory of meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) had
been less; and even if vexation were possible, it would have been out of
place to say so. Still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) would have experienced no little surprise had
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) learnt the real reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) Matilda's change of plan. That angel
had, in short, so wildly spent Bob's and her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) own money in the adornment
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) person before setting out, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) found herself without a
sufficient margin for her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) fare by coach, and had scrimped from sheer
necessity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I have got the trap out at the Greyhound,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
know whether it will hold your luggage and us too; but it looked more
respectable than the waggon on a Sunday, and if there's not room for the
boxes I can walk alongside.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think there will be room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matilda/Miss Johnson/Matilda Johnson</b></font>)</div>said Miss Johnson mildly. And it was soon
very evident that she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) spoke the truth; for when her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) property was
deposited on the pavement, it consisted of a trunk about eighteen inches
long, and nothing more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O--that's all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain Loveday, surprised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the young woman assuringly. ``I didn't want to give
trouble, you know, and what I have besides I have left at my aunt<div class="bookquote">``s.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) answered readily. <div class="bookquote">``And as it's no bigger, I can
carry it in my hand to the inn, and so it will be no trouble at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) caught up the little box, and they went side by side to the Greyhound;
and in ten minutes they were trotting up the Southern Road.

<p/>Bob did not hurry the horse, there being many things to say and hear, for
which the present situation was admirably suited. The sun shone
occasionally into Matilda's face as they drove on, its rays picking out
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) features to a great nicety. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) eyes would have been called
brown, but they were really eel-colour, like many other nice brown eyes;
they were well-shaped and rather bright, though they had more of a broad
shine than a sparkle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) had a firm, sufficient nose, which seemed to
say of itself that it was good as noses go. She (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) had rather a picturesque
way of wrapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) upper in her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) lower lip, so that the red of the latter
showed strongly. Whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) gazed against the sun towards the distant
hills, she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) brought into her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) forehead, without knowing it, three short
vertical lines--not there at other times--giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) for the moment
rather a hard look. And in turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) head round to a far angle, to
stare at something or other that he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) pointed out, the drawn flesh of her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>)
neck became a mass of lines. But Bob did not look at these things,
which, of course, were of no significance; for had she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) not told him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), when
they compared ages, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) was a little over two-and-twenty?

<p/>As Nature was hardly invented at this early point of the century, Bob's
Matilda could not say much about the glamour of the hills, or the
shimmering of the foliage, or the wealth of glory in the distant sea, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) would doubtless have done had she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) lived later on; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) did her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>)
best to be interesting, asking Bob about matters of social interest in
the neighbourhood, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) seemed quite a stranger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is your watering-place a large city?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) inquired when they mounted the
hill where the Overcombe folk had waited for the King.

<p/>``Bless you, my dear--no! <div class="bookquote">``Twould be nothing if it wasn't for the Royal
Family, and the lords and ladies, and the regiments of soldiers, and the
frigates, and the King's messengers, and the actors and actresses, and
the games that go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>actors actresses</b></font>)</div><p/>At the words `actors and actresses,'' the innocent young thing pricked up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) ears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does Elliston pay as good salaries this summer as in--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``O, you know about it then? I thought--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O no, no! I have heard of Budmouth--read in the papers, you know, dear
Robert, about the doings there, and the actors and actresses, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, I see. Well, I have been away from England a long time, and
don't know much about the theatre in the town; but I'll take you there
some day. Would it be a treat to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, an amazing treat!''  (<font color='red'><b>Matilda/Miss Johnson/Matilda Johnson</b></font>)</div>said Miss Johnson, with an ecstasy in which a
close observer might have discovered a tinge of ghastliness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've never been into one perhaps, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``N--never,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matilda/Miss Johnson/Matilda Johnson</b></font>)</div>said Matilda flatly. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever do I see yonder--a row of
white things on the down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's a part of the encampment above Overcombe. Lots of soldiers
are encamped about here; those are the white tops of their tents.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) pointed to a wing of the camp that had become visible. Matilda was
much interested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will make it very lively for us,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) added, `especially as John is
there.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) thought so too, and thus they chatted on.




<p/>XVII. TWO FAINTING FITS AND A BEWILDERMENT


<p/>Meanwhile Miller Loveday was expecting the pair with interest; and about
five o'clock, after repeated outlooks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) saw two specks the size of
caraway seeds on the far line of ridge where the sunlit white of the road
met the blue of the sky. Then the remainder parts of Bob and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) lady
became visible, and then the whole vehicle, end on, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) heard the dry
rattle of the wheels on the dusty road. Miller Loveday's plan, as far as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had formed any, was that Robert and his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) wife should live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) in
the millhouse until Mrs. Garland made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) mind to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) there; in
which event her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) present house would be made over to the young couple.
Upon all grounds, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) wished to welcome becomingly the woman of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) son's
choice, and came forward promptly as they drew up at the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a lovely place you've got here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Matilda/Miss Johnson/Matilda Johnson</b></font>)</div>said Miss Johnson, when the miller
had received her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) from the captain. <div class="bookquote">``A real stream of water, a real mill-
wheel, and real fowls, and everything!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, `tis real enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Loveday, looking at the river with balanced
sentiments; `and so you will say when you've lived here a bit as mis`ess,
and had the trouble of claning the furniture.''

<p/>At this Miss Johnson looked modest, and continued to do so till Anne, not
knowing they were there, came round the corner of the house, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
prayer-book in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand, having just arrived from church. Bob turned and
smiled to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), at which Miss Johnson looked glum. How long she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) would
have remained in that phase is unknown, for just then her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) ears were
assailed by a loud bass note from the other side, causing her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) to jump
round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O la! what dreadful thing is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) exclaimed, and beheld a cow of
Loveday's, of the name of Crumpler, standing close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) shoulder. It
being about milking-time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) had come to look up David and hasten on the
operation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, what a horrid bull!--it did frighten me so. I hope I shan't faint,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Matilda/Miss Johnson/Matilda Johnson</b></font>)</div>said Matilda.

<p/>The miller immediately used the formula which has been uttered by the
proprietors of live stock ever since Noah's time. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) won't hurt ye.
Hoosh, Crumpler! She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)'s as timid as a mouse, ma<div class="bookquote">``am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Crumpler</b></font>)</div><p/>But as Crumpler persisted in making another terrific inquiry for David,
Matilda could not help closing her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) eyes and saying, <div class="bookquote">``O, I shall be gored
to death!''  (<font color='red'><b>Matilda/Miss Johnson/Matilda Johnson</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) head falling back upon Bob's shoulder, which--seeing the
urgent circumstances, and knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) delicate nature--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had
providentially placed in a position to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>). Anne Garland, who had
been standing at the corner of the house, not knowing whether to go back
or come on, at this felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) womanly sympathies aroused. She (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) ran and
dipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) handkerchief into the splashing mill-tail, and with it damped
Matilda's face. But as her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) eyes still remained closed, Bob, to increase
the effect, took the handkerchief from Anne and wrung it out on the
bridge of Matilda's nose, whence it ran over the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) face in a
stream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, Captain Loveday!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, `the water is running over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) green
silk handkerchief, and into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) pretty reticule!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There--if I didn't think so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Matilda/Miss Johnson/Matilda Johnson</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Matilda, opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) eyes,
starting up, and promptly pulling out her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) own handkerchief, with which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) wiped away the drops, and an unimportant trifle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) complexion,
assisted by Anne, who, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) background of antagonistic
emotions, could not help being interested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right!''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller spirits</b></font>)</div>said the miller, his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) spirits reviving with the revival of
Matilda. ``The lady is not used to country life; are you, ma<div class="bookquote">``am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sufferer</b></font>)</div>replied the sufferer. <div class="bookquote">``All is so strange about here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Suddenly there spread into the firmament, from the direction of the
down:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ra, ta, ta! Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta! Ra, ta, ta!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O dear, dear! more hideous country sounds, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) inquired,
with another start.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O no,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller cheerfully. ''`Tis only my son John's trumpeter
chaps at the camp of dragoons just above us, a-blowing Mess, or Feed, or
Picket, or some other of their vagaries. John will be much pleased to
tell you the meaning on't when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) comes down. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'s trumpet-major, as you
may know, ma<div class="bookquote">``am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes; you mean Captain Loveday's brother. Dear Bob has mentioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you come round to Widow Garland's side of the house, you can see the
camp,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't force her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>)'s tired with her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) long journey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garland
humanely, the widow having come out in the general wish to see Captain
Bob's choice. Indeed, they all behaved towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) were a
tender exotic, which their crude country manners might seriously injure.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) went into the house, accompanied by Mrs. Garland and her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) daughter;
though before leaving Bob she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) managed to whisper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) ear, <div class="bookquote">``Don't tell
them I came by waggon, will you, dear?'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--a request which was quite
needless, for Bob had long ago determined to keep that a dead secret; not
because it was an uncommon mode of travel, but simply that it was hardly
the usual conveyance for a gorgeous lady to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bridal.

<p/>As the men had a feeling that they would be superfluous indoors just at
present, the miller assisted David in taking the horse round to the
stables, Bob following, and leaving Matilda to the women. Indoors, Miss
Johnson admired everything: the new parrots and marmosets, the black
beams of the ceiling, the double-corner cupboard with the glass doors,
through which gleamed the remainders of sundry china sets acquired by
Bob's mother in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) housekeeping--two-handled sugar-basins, no-handled
tea-cups, a tea-pot like a pagoda, and a cream-jug in the form of a
spotted cow. This sociability in their visitor was returned by Mrs.
Garland and Anne; and Miss Johnson's pleasing habit of partly dying
whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) heard any unusual bark or bellow added to her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) piquancy in
their eyes. But conversation, as such, was naturally at first of a
nervous, tentative kind, in which, as in the works of some minor poets,
the sense was considerably led by the sound.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You get the sea-breezes here, no doubt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes, dear; when the wind is that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you like windy weather?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; though not now, for it blows down the young apples.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Apples are plentiful, it seems. You country-folk call St. Swithin's
their christening day, if it rains?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear. Ah me! I have not been to a christening for these many
years; the baby's name was George, I remember--after the King.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hear that King George is still staying at the town here. I _hope_
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'ll stay till I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'ll wait till the corn turns yellow; he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) always does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How _very_ fashionable yellow is getting for gloves just now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Some persons wear them to the elbow, I hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do they? I was not aware of that. I struck my elbow last week so hard
against the door of my aunt's mansion that I feel the ache now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the miller Bob</b></font>)</div><p/>Before they were quite overwhelmed by the interest of this discourse, the
miller and Bob came in. In truth, Mrs. Garland found the office in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>)--that of introducing a strange woman to a house which
was not the widow's own--a rather awkward one, and yet almost a
necessity. There was no woman belonging to the house except that
wondrous compendium of usefulness, the intermittent maid-servant, whom
Loveday had, for appearances, borrowed from Mrs. Garland, and Mrs.
Garland was in the habit of borrowing from the girl's mother. And as for
the demi-woman David, he (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) had been informed as peremptorily as Pharaoh's
baker that the office of housemaid and bedmaker was taken from him (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>), and
would be given to this girl till the wedding was over, and Bob's wife
took the management into her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own hands.

<p/>They all sat down to high tea, Anne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother included, and the
captain sitting next to Miss Johnson. Anne had put a brave face upon the
matter--outwardly, at least--and seemed in a fair way of subduing any
lingering sentiment which Bob's return had revived. During the evening,
and while they still sat over the meal, John came down on a hurried
visit, as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had promised, ostensibly on purpose to be introduced to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
intended sister-in-law, but much more to get a word and a smile from his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
beloved Anne. Before they saw him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), they heard the trumpet-major's smart
step coming round the corner of the house, and in a moment his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) form
darkened the door. As it was Sunday, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) appeared in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) full-dress laced
coat, white waistcoat and breeches, and towering plume, the latter of
which he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) instantly lowered, as much from necessity as good manners, the
beam in the mill-house ceiling having a tendency to smash and ruin all
such head-gear without warning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``John, we've been hoping you would come down,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller, `and so
we have kept the tay about on purpose. Draw up, and speak to Mrs.
Matilda Johnson... Ma'am, this is Robert's brother.''

<p/>``Your humble servant, ma<div class="bookquote">``am,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the trumpet-major gallantly.

<p/>As it was getting dusk in the low, small-paned room, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) instinctively
moved towards Miss Johnson as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) spoke, who sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) back to the
window. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had no sooner noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) features than his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) helmet nearly
fell from his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hand; his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) face became suddenly fixed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) natural
complexion took itself off, leaving a greenish yellow in its stead. The
young person, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) part, had no sooner looked closely at him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) than she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>)
said weakly, <div class="bookquote">``Robert's brother!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and changed colour yet more rapidly than
the soldier had done. The faintness, previously half counterfeit, seized
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) now in real earnest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't feel well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) said, suddenly rising by an effort. <div class="bookquote">``This warm
day has quite upset me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a regular collapse of the tea-party, like that of the Hamlet
play scene. Bob seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) sweetheart and carried her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) upstairs, the
miller exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)'s terribly worn by the journey! I thought
she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was when I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) nearly go off at the blare of the cow. No woman
would have been frightened at that if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d been up to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) natural
strength.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sweetheart</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That, and being so very shy of men, too, must have made John's handsome
regimentals quite overpowering to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), poor thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garland/Garland/Mrs. Martha Garland</b></font>)</div>added Mrs. Garland,
following the catastrophic young lady upstairs, whose indisposition was
this time beyond question. And yet, by some perversity of the heart, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
was as eager now to make light of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) faintness as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been to make
much of it two or three hours ago.

<p/>The miller and John stood like straight sticks in the room the others had
quitted, John's face being hastily turned towards a caricature of
Buonaparte on the wall that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had not seen more than a hundred and fifty
times before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, sit down and have a dish of tea, anyhow,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father at last.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll soon be right again, no doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks; I don't want any tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John quickly. And, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did
not, for he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was in one gigantic ache from head to foot.

<p/>The light had been too dim for anybody to notice his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) amazement; and not
knowing where to vent it, the trumpet-major said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was going out for a
minute. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hastened to the bakehouse; but David being there, he (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) went to
the pantry; but the maid being there, he (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) went to the cart-shed; but a
couple of tramps being there, he (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) went behind a row of French beans in the
garden, where he (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) let off an ejaculation the most pious that he (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) had
uttered that Sabbath day: <div class="bookquote">``Heaven! what's to be done!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) walked wildly about the paths of the dusky garden, where the
trickling of the brooks seemed loud by comparison with the stillness
around; treading recklessly on the cracking snails that had come forth to
feed, and entangling his (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) spurs in the long grass till the rowels were
choked with its blades. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) heard another person approaching,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) brother's shape appeared between the stubbard tree and the hedge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, is it you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mate</b></font>)</div>said the mate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I am--taking a little air.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is getting round nicely again; and as I am not wanted indoors just
now, I am going into the village to call upon a friend or two I have not
been able to speak to as yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div><p/>John took his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) brother Bob's hand. Bob rather wondered why.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, old boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Going into the village? You'll be back
again, I suppose, before it gets very late?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain Bob cheerfully, and passed out of the garden.

<p/>John allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eyes to follow his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) brother till his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) shape could not be
seen, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) turned and again walked up and down.




<p/>XVIII. THE NIGHT AFTER THE ARRIVAL


<p/>John continued his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sad and heavy pace till walking seemed too old and
worn-out a way of showing sorrow so new, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) leant himself against the
fork of an apple-tree like a log. There the trumpet-major remained for a
considerable time, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) face turned towards the house, whose ancient, many-
chimneyed outline rose against the darkened sky, and just shut out from
his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) view the camp above. But faint noises coming thence from horses
restless at the pickets, and from visitors taking their leave, recalled
its existence, and reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) that, in consequence of Matilda's
arrival, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had obtained leave for the night--a fact which, owing to the
startling emotions that followed his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) entry, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had not yet mentioned to
his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) friends.

<p/>While abstractedly considering how he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could best use that privilege under
the new circumstances which had arisen, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) heard Farmer Derriman drive up
to the front door and hold a conversation with his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) father. The old man
had at last apparently brought the tin box of private papers that he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>)
wished the miller to take charge of during Derriman's absence; and it
being a calm night, John could hear, though he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) little heeded, Uncle
Benjy's reiterated supplications to Loveday to keep it safe from fire and
thieves. Then Uncle Benjy left, and John's father went upstairs to
deposit the box in a place of security, the whole proceeding reaching
John's preoccupied comprehension merely as voices during sleep.

<p/>The next thing was the appearance of a light in the bedroom which had
been assigned to Matilda Johnson. This effectually aroused the trumpet-
major, and with a stealthiness unusual in him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) went indoors. No light
was in the lower rooms, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father, Mrs. Garland, and Anne having gone
out on the bridge to look at the new moon. John went upstairs on tip-
toe, and along the uneven passage till he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) door. It was
standing ajar, a band of candlelight shining across the passage and up
the opposite wall. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) entered the radiance he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
was standing before the looking-glass, apparently lost in thought, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
fingers being clasped behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head in abstraction, and the light
falling full upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must speak to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>said the trumpet-major.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) started, turned and grew paler than before; and then, as if moved by
a sudden impulse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) swung the door wide open, and, coming out, said
quite collectedly and with apparent pleasantness, <div class="bookquote">``O yes; you are my
Bob's brother! I didn't, for a moment, recognize you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you do now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As Bob's brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not seen me before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) answered, with a face as impassible as Talleyrand's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor any of the --th Dragoons? Captain Jolly, for instance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mistake. I'll remind you of particulars,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said drily. And he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
did remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) at some length.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said desperately.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had miscalculated her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) staying powers, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) adversary's
character. Five minutes after that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was in tears, and the
conversation had resolved itself into words, which, on the soldier's
part, were of the nature of commands, tempered by pity, and were a mere
series of entreaties on hers.

<p/>The whole scene did not last ten minutes. When it was over, the trumpet-
major walked from the doorway where they had been standing, and brushed
moisture from his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) eyes. Reaching a dark lumber-room, he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) stood still
there to calm himself, and then descended by a Flemish-ladder to the
bakehouse, instead of by the front stairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) found that the others,
including Bob, had gathered in the parlour during his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) absence and lighted
the candles.

<p/>Miss Johnson, having sent down some time before John re-entered the house
to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) would prefer to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) room that evening, was not
expected to join them, and on this account Bob showed less than his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
customary liveliness. The miller wishing to keep up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) son's spirits,
expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) regret that, it being Sunday night, they could have no
songs to make the evening cheerful; when Mrs. Garland proposed that they
should sing psalms which, by choosing lively tunes and not thinking of
the words, would be almost as good as ballads.

<p/>This they did, the trumpet-major appearing to join in with the rest; but
as a matter of fact no sound came from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) moving lips. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) mind was in
such a state that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) derived no pleasure even from Anne Garland's
presence, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) held a corner of the same book with her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>), and was
treated in a winsome way which it was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) usual practice to indulge
in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) mind was clouded, and, far from guessing the reason
why, was doing her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) best to clear it.

<p/>At length the Garlands found that it was the hour for them to leave, and
John Loveday at the same time wished his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) father and Bob good-night, and
went as far as Mrs. Garland's door with her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had said not a word to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) was free to remain out of camp,
for the reason that there was painful work to be done, which it would be
best to do in secret and alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) lingered near the house till its
reflected window-lights ceased to glimmer upon the mill-pond, and all
within the dwelling was dark and still. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) entered the garden and
waited there till the back door opened, and a woman's figure timorously
came forward. John Loveday at once went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and they began to
talk in low yet dissentient tones.

<p/>They had conversed about ten minutes, and were parting as if they had
come to some painful arrangement, Miss Johnson sobbing bitterly, when a
head stealthily arose above the dense hedgerow, and in a moment a shout
burst from its owner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thieves! thieves!--my tin box!--thieves! thieves!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Matilda/Miss Johnson/Matilda Johnson</b></font>)</div><p/>Matilda vanished into the house, and John Loveday hastened to the hedge.
<div class="bookquote">``For heaven's sake, hold your tongue, Mr. Derriman!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My tin box!''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Benjy. <div class="bookquote">``O, only the trumpet-major!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your box is safe enough, I assure you. It was only'--here the trumpet-
major gave vent to an artificial laugh--`only a sly bit of courting, you
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha, ha, I see!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the relieved old squireen. <div class="bookquote">``Courting Miss Anne!
Then you've ousted my nephew, trumpet-major! Well, so much the better.
As for myself, the truth on't is that I haven't been able to go to bed
easy, for thinking that possibly your father might not take care of what
I put under his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) charge; and at last I thought I would just step over and
see if all was safe here before I turned in. And when I saw your two
shapes my poor nerves magnified ye to housebreakers, and Boneys, and I
don't know what all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have alarmed the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said the trumpet-major, hearing the
clicking of flint and steel in his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) father's bedroom, followed in a moment
by the rise of a light in the window of the same apartment. <div class="bookquote">``You have
got me into difficulty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) added gloomily, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) father opened the
casement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Benjy. <div class="bookquote">``But step back; I'll put it all
right again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, for heaven's sake, is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller nightcap</b></font>)</div>said the miller, his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) tasselled
nightcap appearing in the opening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, nothing!''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>said the farmer. ``I was uneasy about my few bonds
and documents, and I walked this way, miller, before going to bed, as I
start from home to-morrow morning. When I came down by your
garden-hedge, I thought I saw thieves, but it turned out to be--to be--'

<p/>Here a lump of earth from the trumpet-major's hand struck Uncle Benjy in
the back as a reminder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be--the bough of a cherry-tree a-waving in the wind. Good-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No thieves are like to try my house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Miller Loveday. <div class="bookquote">``Now don't
you come alarming us like this again, farmer, or you shall keep your box
yourself, begging your pardon for saying so. Good-night t' ye!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miller, will ye just look, since I am here--just look and see if the box
is all right? there's a good man! I am old, you know, and my poor
remains are not what my original self was. Look and see if it is where
you put it, there's a good, kind man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the miller good-humouredly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Neighbour Loveday! on second thoughts I will take my box home again,
after all, if you don't mind. You won't deem it ill of me? I have no
suspicion, of course; but now I think on't there's rivalry between my
nephew and your son; and if Festus should take it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) head to set
your house on fire in his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) enmity, `twould be bad for my deeds and
documents. No offence, miller, but I'll take the box, if you don't
mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Faith! I don't mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Loveday. <div class="bookquote">``But your nephew had better think
twice before he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) lets his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) enmity take that colour.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Receding from the
window, he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) took the candle to a back part of the room and soon reappeared
with the tin box.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't trouble ye to dress,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Derriman considerately; `let en down
by anything you have at hand.''

<p/>The box was lowered by a cord, and the old man clasped it in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms.
<div class="bookquote">``Thank ye!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said with heartfelt gratitude. <div class="bookquote">``Good-night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The miller</b></font>)</div><p/>The miller replied and closed the window, and the light went out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, now I hope you are satisfied, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the trumpet-major.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite, quite!''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Derriman; and, leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) walking-stick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>)
pursued his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) lonely way.

<p/>That night Anne lay awake in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) bed, musing on the traits of the new
friend who had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) neighbour's house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would not be critical,
it was ungenerous and wrong; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not help thinking of what
interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). And were there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) silently asked, in Miss Johnson's
mind and person such rare qualities as placed that lady altogether beyond
comparison with herself? O yes, there must be; for had not Captain Bob
singled out Matilda from among all other women, herself included? Of
course, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) world-wide experience, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) knew best.

<p/>When the moon had set, and only the summer stars threw their light into
the great damp garden, she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) fancied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) heard voices in that
direction. Perhaps they were the voices of Bob and Matilda taking a
lover's walk before retiring. If so, how sleepy they would be next day,
and how absurd it was of Matilda to pretend she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) was tired! Ruminating in
this way, and saying to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) hoped they would be happy, Anne
fell asleep.




<p/>XIX. MISS JOHNSON``S BEHAVIOUR CAUSES NO LITTLE SURPRISE


<p/>Partly from the excitement of having his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) Matilda under the paternal roof,
Bob rose next morning as early as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father and the grinder, and, when
the big wheel began to patter and the little ones to mumble in response,
went to sun himself outside the mill-front, among the fowls of brown and
speckled kinds which haunted that spot, and the ducks that came up from
the mill-tail.

<p/>Standing on the worn-out mill-stone inlaid in the gravel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) talked with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father on various improvements of the premises, and on the proposed
arrangements for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) permanent residence there, with an enjoyment that
was half based upon this prospect of the future, and half on the
penetrating warmth of the sun to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) back and shoulders. Then the
different troops of horses began their morning scramble down to the mill-
pond, and, after making it very muddy round the edge, ascended the slope
again. The bustle of the camp grew more and more audible, and presently
David came to say that breakfast was ready.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Miss Johnson downstairs?''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller Bob</b></font>)</div>said the miller; and Bob listened for the
answer, looking at a blue sentinel aloft on the down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet, maister,''  (<font color='red'><b>David</b></font>)</div>said the excellent David.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll wait till she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>)'s down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Loveday. <div class="bookquote">``When she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) is, let us know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>David</b></font>)</div><p/>David went indoors again, and Loveday and Bob continued their morning
survey by ascending into the mysterious quivering recesses of the mill,
and holding a discussion over a second pair of burr-stones, which had to
be re-dressed before they could be used again. This and similar things
occupied nearly twenty minutes, and, looking from the window, the elder
of the two was reminded of the time of day by seeing Mrs. Garland's table-
cloth fluttering from her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) back door over the heads of a flock of pigeons
that had alighted for the crumbs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose David can't find us,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said, with a sense of hunger that was
not altogether strange to Bob. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) head and shouted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The lady is not down yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) man in reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No hurry, no hurry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller, with cheerful emptiness. <div class="bookquote">``Bob, to
pass the time we'll look into the garden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'ll get up sooner than this, you know, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s signed articles and
got a berth here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>Bob observed apologetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Loveday; and they descended into the garden.

<p/>Here they turned over sundry flat stones and killed the slugs sheltered
beneath them from the coming heat of the day, talking of slugs in all
their branches--of the brown and the black, of the tough and the tender,
of the reason why there were so many in the garden that year, of the
coming time when the grass-walks harbouring them were to be taken up and
gravel laid, and of the relatively exterminatory merits of a pair of
scissors and the heel of the shoe. At last the miller said, <div class="bookquote">``Well,
really, Bob, I'm hungry; we must begin without her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div><p/>They were about to go in, when David appeared with haste in his (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) motions,
his (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) eyes wider vertically than crosswise, and his (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) cheeks nearly all gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maister, I've been to call her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); and as 'a didn't speak I rapped, and as
'a didn't answer I kicked, and not being latched the door opened,
and--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s gone!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob went off like a swallow towards the house, and the miller followed
like the rather heavy man that he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) was. That Miss Matilda was not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>)
room, or a scrap of anything belonging to her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>), was soon apparent. They
searched every place in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) could possibly hide or squeeze herself,
every place in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) could not, but found nothing at all.

<p/>Captain Bob was quite wild with astonishment and grief. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was
quite sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) was nowhere in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father's house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) ran into Mrs.
Garland's, and telling them the story so hastily that they hardly
understood the particulars, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) went on towards Comfort's house, intending
to raise the alarm there, and also at Mitchell's, Beach's,
Cripplestraw's, the parson's, the clerk's, the camp of dragoons, of
hussars, and so on through the whole county. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) paused, and thought
it would be hardly expedient to publish his (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) discomfiture in such a way.
If Matilda had left the house for any freakish reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) would not care
to look for her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>), and if her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) deed had a tragic intent she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) would keep aloof
from camp and village.

<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) trouble he (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) thought of Anne. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was a nice girl and could be
trusted. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) went, and found her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in a state of excitement and
anxiety which equalled his (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis so lonely to cruise for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) all by myself!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said Bob
disconsolately, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) forehead all in wrinkles, `and I've thought you would
come with me and cheer the way?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where shall we search?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, in the holes of rivers, you know, and down wells, and in quarries,
and over cliffs, and like that. Your eyes might catch the loom of any
bit of a shawl or bonnet that I should overlook, and it would do me a
real service. Please do come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>So Anne took pity upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), and put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hat and went, the miller and
David having gone off in another direction. They examined the ditches of
fields, Bob going round by one fence and Anne by the other, till they met
at the opposite side. Then they peeped under culverts, into outhouses,
and down old wells and quarries, till the theory of a tragical end had
nearly spent its force in Bob's mind, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) began to think that Matilda
had simply run away. However, they still walked on, though by this time
the sun was hot and Anne would gladly have sat down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, didn't you think highly of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), Miss Garland?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) inquired, as the
search began to languish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, `very highly.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) was really beautiful; no nonsense about her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) looks, was there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) beauty was thoroughly ripe--not too young. We should all
have got to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>). What can have possessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) to go away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, and, upon my life, I shall soon be drove to say I don't
care!''  (<font color='red'><b>the mate</b></font>)</div>replied the mate despairingly. <div class="bookquote">``Let me pilot ye down over those
stones,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) added, as Anne began to descend a rugged quarry. He (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) stepped
forward, leapt down, and turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand and sprang down. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) relinquished his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) hold,
Captain Bob raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) fingers to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) lips and kissed them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, Captain Loveday!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>cried Anne, snatching away her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand in genuine
dismay, while a tear rose unexpectedly to each eye. <div class="bookquote">``I never heard of
such a thing! I won't go an inch further with you, sir; it is too
barefaced!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) turned and ran off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my life I didn't mean it!''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>said the repentant captain, hastening
after. <div class="bookquote">``I do love her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) best--indeed I do--and I don't love you at all! I
am not so fickle as that! I merely just for the moment admired you as a
sweet little craft, and that's how I came to do it. You know, Miss
Garland,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) continued earnestly, and still running after, <div class="bookquote">''tis like
this: when you come ashore after having been shut up in a ship for
eighteen months, women-folks seem so new and nice that you can't help
liking them, one and all in a body; and so your heart is apt to get
scattered and to yaw a bit; but of course I think of poor Matilda most,
and shall always stick to her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) heaved a sigh of tremendous
magnitude, to show beyond the possibility of doubt that his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) heart was
still in the place that honour required.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to hear that--of course I am very glad!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>), with quick
petulance, keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) face turned from him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And I hope we shall find
her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>), and that the wedding will not be put off, and that you'll both be
happy. But I won't look for her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) any more! No; I don't care to look for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>)--and my head aches. I am going home!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so am I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Robert promptly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; go on looking for her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>), of course--all the afternoon, and all
night. I am sure you will, if you love her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes; I mean to. Still, I ought to convoy you home first?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you ought not; and I shall not accept your company. Good-morning,
sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) went off over one of the stone stiles with which the spot
abounded, leaving the friendly sailor standing in the field.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) sighed again, and, observing the camp not far off, thought he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) would go
to his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) brother John and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) opinion on the sorrowful case. On
reaching the tents he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) found that John was not at liberty just at that
time, being engaged in practising the trumpeters; and leaving word that
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wished the trumpet-major to come down to the mill as soon as possible,
Bob went back again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis no good looking for her (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said gloomily. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) liked me well
enough, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) came here and saw the house, and the place, and the
old horse, and the plain furniture, she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) was disappointed to find us all
so homely, and felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) didn't care to marry into such a family!''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father and David had returned with no news.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, `tis as I've been thinking, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>Bob said. <div class="bookquote">``We weren't good
enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) went away in scorn!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that can't be helped,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller. <div class="bookquote">``What we be, we be, and
have been for generations. To my mind she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) seemed glad enough to get hold
of us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes--for the moment--because of the flowers, and birds, and what's
pretty in the place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob tragically. <div class="bookquote">``But you don't know,
father--how should you know, who have hardly been out of Overcombe in
your life?--you don't know what delicate feelings are in a real refined
woman's mind. Any little vulgar action unreaves their nerves like a
marline-spike. Now I wonder if you did anything to disgust her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Faith! not that I know of,''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Loveday, reflecting. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't say a
single thing that I should naturally have said, on purpose to give no
offence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You was always very homely, you know, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; so I was,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller meekly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder what it could have been,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>Bob continued, wandering about
restlessly. <div class="bookquote">``You didn't go drinking out of the big mug with your mouth
full, or wipe your lips with your sleeve?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``That I'll swear I didn``t!'' said the miller firmly. <div class="bookquote">``Thinks I, there's
no knowing what I may do to shock her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>), so I'll take my solid victuals in
the bakehouse, and only a crumb and a drop in her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) company for manners.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You could do no more than that, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob gently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If my manners be good enough for well-brought-up people like the
Garlands, they be good enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>continued the miller, with a
sense of injustice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true. Then it must have been David. David, come here! How did
you behave before that lady? Now, mind you speak the truth!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. Captain Robert,''  (<font color='red'><b>David</b></font>)</div>said David earnestly. ``I assure ye she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was
served like a royal queen. The best silver spoons wez put down, and yer
poor grandfer's silver tanket, as you seed, and the feather cushion for
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to sit on--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I've got it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob decisively, bringing down his (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) hand upon the
window-sill. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bed was hard!--and there's nothing shocks a true lady
like that. The bed in that room always was as hard as the Rock of
Gibraltar!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Captain Bob! The beds were changed--wasn't they maister? We put
the goose bed in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) room, and the flock one, that used to be there, in
yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, we did,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>corroborated the miller. <div class="bookquote">``David and I changed 'em with
our own hands, because they were too heavy for the women to move.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure I didn't know I had the flock bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>murmured Bob. <div class="bookquote">``I slept on,
little thinking what I was going to wake to. Well, well, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s gone; and
search as I will I shall never find another like her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was too good
for me. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must have carried her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) box with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own hands, poor girl. As
far as that goes, I could overtake her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) even now, I dare say; but I won't
entreat her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) against her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will--not I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div><p/>Miller Loveday and David, feeling themselves to be rather a desecration
in the presence of Bob's sacred emotions, managed to edge off by degrees,
the former burying himself in the most floury recesses of the mill, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
invariable resource when perturbed, the rumbling having a soothing effect
upon the nerves of those properly trained to its music.

<p/>Bob was so impatient that, after going up to her (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) room to assure himself
once more that she (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) had not undressed, but had only lain down on the
outside of the bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) went out of the house to meet John, and waited on
the sunny slope of the down till his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) brother appeared. John looked so
brave and shapely and warlike that, even in Bob's present distress, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
could not but feel an honest and affectionate pride at owning such a
relative. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) fancied that John did not come along with the same
swinging step he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had shown yesterday; and when the trumpet-major got
nearer he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) looked anxiously at the mate and waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to speak first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know our great trouble, John?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Robert, gazing stoically into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) brother's eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and sit down, and tell me all about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered the
trumpet-major, showing no surprise.

<p/>They went towards a slight ravine, where it was easier to sit down than
on the flat ground, and here John reclined among the grasshoppers,
pointing to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) brother to do the same.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But do you know what it is?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Robert. <div class="bookquote">``Has anybody told ye?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do know,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s gone; and I am thankful!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob, rising to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) knees in amazement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm at the bottom of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the trumpet-major slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You, John?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and if you will listen I'll tell you all. Do you remember what
happened when I came into the room last night? Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) turned colour
and nearly fainted away. That was because she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knew me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob stared at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) brother with a face of pain and distrust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For once, Bob, I must say something that will hurt thee a good deal,''
 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>continued John. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not a woman who could possibly be your wife--and
so she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You sent her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``John!--Tell me right through--tell me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I had better,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the trumpet-major, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) blue eyes resting on
the far distant sea, that seemed to rise like a wall as high as the hill
they sat upon.

<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) told a tale of Miss Johnson and the --th Dragoons which wrung
his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) heart as much in the telling as it did Bob's to hear, and which
showed that John had been temporarily cruel to be ultimately kind. Even
Bob, excited as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was, could discern from John's manner of speaking what
a terrible undertaking that night's business had been for him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). To
justify the course he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had adopted the dictates of duty must have been
imperative; but the trumpet-major, with a becoming reticence which his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
brother at the time was naturally unable to appreciate, scarcely dwelt
distinctly enough upon the compelling cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) conduct. It would,
indeed, have been hard for any man, much less so modest a one as John, to
do himself justice in that remarkable relation, when the listener was the
lady's lover; and it is no wonder that Robert rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) feet and put a
greater distance between himself and John.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what time was it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) asked in a hard, suppressed voice.

<p/>``It was just before one o<div class="bookquote">``clock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How could you help her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to go away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had a pass. I carried her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) box to the coach-office. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was to follow
at dawn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had no money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had; I took particular care of that.''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>John did not add, as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
might have done, that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) pity, all the money he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
possessed, and at present had only eighteen-pence in the world. <div class="bookquote">``Well,
it is over, Bob; so sit ye down, and talk with me of old times,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Jack, it is well enough for you to speak like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sailor</b></font>)</div>said the
disquieted sailor; `but I can't help feeling that it is a cruel thing you
have done. After all, she (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) would have been snug enough for me. Would I
had never found out this about her (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)! John, why did you interfere? You
had no right to overhaul my affairs like this. Why didn't you tell me
fairly all you knew, and let me do as I chose? You have turned her (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) out
of the house, and it's a shame! If she (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had only come to me! Why didn't
she (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knew it was best to do otherwise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I shall go after her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob firmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can do as you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John; `but I would advise you strongly to
leave matters where they are.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't leave matters where they are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob impetuously. <div class="bookquote">``You have
made me miserable, and all for nothing. I tell you she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was good enough
for me; and as long as I knew nothing about what you say of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) history,
what difference would it have made to me? Never was there a young woman
who was better company; and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loved a merry song as I do myself. Yes,
I'll follow her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John; <div class="bookquote">``I hardly expected this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's because you didn't know your man. Can I ask you to do me one
kindness? I don't suppose I can. Can I ask you not to say a word
against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to any of them at home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. The very reason why I got her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to go off silently, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has
done, was because nothing should be said against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) here, and no scandal
should be heard of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That may be; but I'm off after her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Marry that girl I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll be sorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That we shall see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Loveday</b></font>)</div>replied Robert with determination; and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) went away
rapidly towards the mill. The trumpet-major had no heart to follow--no
good could possibly come of further opposition; and there on the down he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
remained like a graven image till Bob had vanished from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) sight into
the mill.

<p/>Bob entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father's only to leave word that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was going on a
renewed search for Matilda, and to pack up a few necessaries for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
journey. Ten minutes later he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) came out again with a bundle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) hand,
and John saw him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) go diagonally across the lower fields towards the high-
road.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And this is all the good I have done!''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John, musingly readjusting
his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) stock where it cut his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) neck, and descending towards the mill.




<p/>XX. HOW THEY LESSENED THE EFFECT OF THE CALAMITY


<p/>Meanwhile Anne Garland had gone home, and, being weary with her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) ramble in
search of Matilda, sat silent in a corner of the room. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) mother was
passing the time in giving utterance to every conceivable surmise on the
cause of Miss Johnson's disappearance that the human mind could frame, to
which Anne returned monosyllabic answers, the result, not of
indifference, but of intense preoccupation. Presently Loveday, the
father, came to the door; her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother vanished with him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>), and they remained
closeted together a long time. Anne went into the garden and seated
herself beneath the branching tree whose boughs had sheltered her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) during
so many hours of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) residence here. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) attention was fixed more upon
the miller's wing of the irregular building before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) than upon that
occupied by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not help expecting every moment to
see some one run out with a wild face and announce some awful clearing up
of the mystery.

<p/>Every sound set her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) on the alert, and hearing the tread of a horse in the
lane she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) looked round eagerly. Gazing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) over the hedge was Festus
Derriman, mounted on such an incredibly tall animal that he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) could see to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) very feet over the thick and broad thorn fence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) no sooner
recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) glance; but as his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) eyes were fixed
steadily upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) this was a futile manoeuvre.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw you look round!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) exclaimed crossly. ``What have I done to make
you behave like that? Come, Miss Garland, be fair. ``Tis no use to turn
your back upon me.'' As she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not turn he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) went on--<div class="bookquote">``Well, now, this is
enough to provoke a saint. Now I tell you what, Miss Garland; here I'll
stay till you do turn round, if `tis all the afternoon. You know my
temper--what I say I mean.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) seated himself firmly in the saddle,
plucked some leaves from the hedge, and began humming a song, to show how
absolutely indifferent he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) was to the flight of time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you come for, that you are so anxious to see me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>inquired
Anne, when at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) had wearied her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) patience, rising and facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>)
with the added independence which came from a sense of the hedge between
them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, I knew you would turn round!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) said, his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) hot angry face invaded
by a smile in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) teeth showed like white hemmed in by red at
chess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want, Mr. Derriman?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``What do you want, Mr. Derriman?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--now listen to that! Is that my
encouragement?''

<p/>Anne bowed superciliously, and moved away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have just heard news that explains all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the giant</b></font>)</div>said the giant, eyeing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) movements with somnolent irascibility. <div class="bookquote">``My uncle has been letting
things out. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was here late last night, and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) saw you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) didn<div class="bookquote">``t,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, now! He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) saw Trumpet-major Loveday courting somebody like you in that
garden walk; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) came you ran indoors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not true, and I wish to hear no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my life, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) said so! How can you do it, Miss Garland, when I, who
have enough money to buy up all the Lovedays, would gladly come to terms
with ye? What a simpleton you must be, to pass me over for him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)! There,
now you are angry because I said simpleton!--I didn't mean simpleton, I
meant misguided--misguided rosebud! That's it--run off,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) continued in
a raised voice, as Anne made towards the garden door. <div class="bookquote">``But I'll have you
yet. Much reason you have to be too proud to stay with me. But it won't
last long; I shall marry you, madam, if I choose, as you'll see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) was quite gone, and Anne had calmed down from the not altogether
unrelished fear and excitement that he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) always caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) returned to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) seat under the tree, and began to wonder what Festus Derriman's story
meant, which, from the earnestness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) tone, did not seem like a pure
invention. It suddenly flashed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) herself had heard
voices in the garden, and that the persons seen by Farmer Derriman, of
whose visit and reclamation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) box the miller had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), might
have been Matilda and John Loveday. She (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) further recalled the strange
agitation of Miss Johnson on the preceding evening, and that it occurred
just at the entry of the dragoon, till by degrees suspicion amounted to
conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) knew more than any one else supposed of that lady's
disappearance.

<p/>It was just at this time that the trumpet-major descended to the mill
after his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) talk with his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) brother on the down. As fate would have it,
instead of entering the house he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) turned aside to the garden and walked
down that pleasant enclosure, to learn if he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) were likely to find in the
other half of it the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) loved so well.

<p/>Yes, there she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was, sitting on the seat of logs that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had repaired for
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), under the apple-tree; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not facing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) direction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
walked with a noisier tread, he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) coughed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) shook a bough, he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) did
everything, in short, but the one thing that Festus did in the same
circumstances--call out to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) would not have ventured on that for
the world. Any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) signs would have been sufficient to attract her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a
day or two earlier; now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would not turn. At last, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) fond
anxiety, he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) did what he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) had never done before without an invitation, and
crossed over into Mrs. Garland's half of the garden, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) stood before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>).

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) could not escape him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) arose, and, saying <div class="bookquote">``Good afternoon,
trumpet-major,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>in a glacial manner unusual with her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>), walked away to
another part of the garden.

<p/>Loveday, quite at a loss, had not the strength of mind to persevere
further. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had a vague apprehension that some imperfect knowledge of
the previous night's unhappy business had reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>); and, unable to
remedy the evil without telling more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) dared, he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) went into the
mill, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) father still was, looking doleful enough, what with his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
concern at events and the extra quantity of flour upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) face through
sticking so closely to business that day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, John; Bob has told you all, of course? A queer, strange,
perplexing thing, isn't it? I can't make it out at all. There must be
something wrong in the woman, or it couldn't have happened. I haven't
been so upset for years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor have I. I wouldn't it should have happened for all I own in the
world,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dragoon</b></font>)</div>said the dragoon. <div class="bookquote">``Have you spoke to Anne Garland to-day--or has
anybody been talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Festus Derriman rode by half-an-hour ago, and talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) over the
hedge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div><p/>John guessed the rest, and, after standing on the threshold in silence
awhile, walked away towards the camp.

<p/>All this time his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) brother Robert had been hastening along in pursuit of
the woman who had withdrawn from the scene to avoid the exposure and
complete overthrow which would have resulted had she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) remained. As the
distance lengthened between himself and the mill, Bob was conscious of
some cooling down of the excitement that had prompted him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) to set out; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) did not pause in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) walk till he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had reached the head of the river
which fed the mill-stream. Here, for some indefinite reason, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) allowed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) eyes to be attracted by the bubbling spring whose waters never failed
or lessened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) stopped as if to look longer at the scene; it was
really because his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) mind was so absorbed by John's story.

<p/>The sun was warm, the spot was a pleasant one, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) deposited his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
bundle and sat down. By degrees, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) reflected, first on John's view
and then on his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) convictions became unsettled; till at length he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
was so balanced between the impulse to go on and the impulse to go back,
that a puff of wind either way would have been well-nigh sufficient to
decide for him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) allowed John's story to repeat itself in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
ears, the reasonableness and good sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) advice seemed beyond
question. When, on the other hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) poor Matilda's
eyes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>), to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), pleasant ways, their charming arrangements to
marry, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) probable willingness still, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could hardly bring himself
to do otherwise than follow on the road at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) speed.

<p/>This strife of thought was so well maintained that sitting and standing,
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) remained on the borders of the spring till the shadows had stretched
out eastwards, and the chance of overtaking Matilda had grown
considerably less. Still he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did not positively go towards home. At last
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) took a guinea from his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) pocket, and resolved to put the question to the
hazard. ``Heads I go; tails I don<div class="bookquote">``t.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The piece of gold spun in the air
and came down heads.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I won't go, after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I won't be steered by accidents
any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) bundle and switch, and retraced his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) steps towards
Overcombe Mill, knocking down the brambles and nettles as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) went with
gloomy and indifferent blows. When he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) got within sight of the house he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
beheld David in the road.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right--all right again, captain!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>, shouted that retainer. <div class="bookquote">``A
wedding after all! Hurrah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s back again?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>cried Bob, seizing David, ecstatically, and
dancing round with him (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--but it's all the same! it is of no consequence at all, and no harm
will be done! Maister and Mrs. Garland have made up a match, and mean to
marry at once, that the wedding victuals may not be wasted! They felt
`twould be a thousand pities to let such good things get blue-vinnied for
want of a ceremony to use 'em upon, and at last they have thought of
this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Victuals--I don't care for the victuals!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>bitterly cried Bob, in a tone
of far higher thought. <div class="bookquote">``How you disappoint me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) went slowly
towards the house.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father appeared in the opening of the mill-door, looking more
cheerful than when they had parted. <div class="bookquote">``What, Robert, you've been after
her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Faith, then, I wouldn't have followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) if I had been
as sure as you were that she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) went away in scorn of us. Since you told me
that, I have not looked for her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was wrong, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>Bob replied gravely, throwing down his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) bundle and
stick. <div class="bookquote">``Matilda, I find, has not gone away in scorn of us; she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) has gone
away for other reasons. I followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) some way; but I have come back
again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) may go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why is she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) gone?''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the astonished miller.

<p/>Bob had intended, for Matilda's sake, to give no reason to a living soul
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) departure. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) could not treat his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father thus reservedly;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) told.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) has made great fools of us,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller deliberately; `and she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>)
might have made us greater ones. Bob, I thought th' hadst more sense.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, don't say anything against her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>), father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>implored Bob. <div class="bookquote">'''Twas a
sorry haul, and there's an end on't. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) down quietly, and keep the
secret. You promise that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>Loveday the elder remained thinking awhile, and then went
on--<div class="bookquote">``Well, what I was going to say is this: I've hit upon a plan to get
out of the awkward corner she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) has put us in. What you'll think of it I
can't say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``David has just given me the heads.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do it hurt your feelings, my son, at such a time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I'll bring myself to bear it, anyhow! Why should I object to other
people's happiness because I have lost my own?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob, with saintly
self-sacrifice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well said!''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>answered the miller heartily. ``But you may be sure that
there will be no unseemly rejoicing, to disturb ye in your present frame
of mind. All the morning I felt more ashamed than I cared to own at the
thought of how the neighbours, great and small, would laugh at what they
would call your folly, when they knew what had happened; so I resolved to
take this step to stave it off, if so be 'twas possible. And when I saw
Mrs. Garland I knew I had done right. She (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) pitied me so much for having
had the house cleaned in vain, and laid in provisions to waste, that it
put her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) into the humour to agree. We mean to do it right off at once,
afore the pies and cakes get mouldy and the blackpot stale. <div class="bookquote">``Twas a good
thought of mine and hers, and I am glad `tis settled,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) concluded
cheerfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Matilda!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>murmured Bob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There--I was afraid `twould hurt thy feelings,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller, with
self-reproach: `making preparations for thy wedding, and using them for
my own!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob heroically; `it shall not. It will be a great comfort in
my sorrow to feel that the splendid grub, and the ale, and your stunning
new suit of clothes, and the great table-cloths you've bought, will be
just as useful now as if I had married myself. Poor Matilda! But you
won't expect me to join in--you hardly can. I can sheer off that day
very easily, you know.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Bob!''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller reproachfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't stand it--I should break down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Deuce take me if I would have asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>), then, if I had known 'twas
going to drive thee out of the house! Now, come, Bob, I'll find a way of
arranging it and sobering it down, so that it shall be as melancholy as
you can require--in short, just like a funeral, if thou`lt promise to
stay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the afflicted one. <div class="bookquote">``On that condition I'll stay.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>XXI. ``UPON THE HILL HE (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) TURNED'


<p/>Having entered into this solemn compact with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) son, the elder Loveday's
next action was to go to Mrs. Garland, and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) how the toning down of
the wedding had best be done. <div class="bookquote">``It is plain enough that to make merry
just now would be slighting Bob's feelings, as if we didn't care who was
not married, so long as we were,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But then, what's to be done
about the victuals?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give a dinner to the poor folk,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) suggested. <div class="bookquote">``We can get everything
used up that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``That's true' said the miller. <div class="bookquote">``There's enough of 'em in these times to
carry off any extras whatsoever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And it will save Bob's feelings wonderfully. And they won't know that
the dinner was got for another sort of wedding and another sort of
guests; so you'll have their good-will for nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The miller smiled at the subtlety of the view. <div class="bookquote">``That can hardly be
called fair,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Still, I did mean some of it for them, for the
friends we meant to ask would not have cleared all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Upon the whole the idea pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) well, particularly when he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) noticed
the forlorn look of his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) sailor son as he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) walked about the place, and
pictured the inevitably jarring effect of fiddles and tambourines upon
Bob's shattered nerves at such a crisis, even if the notes of the former
were dulled by the application of a mute, and Bob shut up in a distant
bedroom--a plan which had at first occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) therefore told
Bob that the surcharged larder was to be emptied by the charitable
process above alluded to, and hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) would not mind making himself
useful in such a good and gloomy work. Bob readily fell in with the
scheme, and it was at once put in hand and the tables spread.

<p/>The alacrity with which the substituted wedding was carried out, seemed
to show that the worthy pair of neighbours would have joined themselves
into one long ago, had there previously occurred any domestic incident
dictating such a step as an apposite expedient, apart from their personal
wish to marry.

<p/>The appointed morning came, and the service quietly took place at the
cheerful hour of ten, in the face of a triangular congregation, of which
the base was the front pew, and the apex the west door. Mrs. Garland
dressed herself in the muslin shawl like Queen Charlotte's, that Bob had
brought home, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) best plum-coloured gown, beneath which peeped out
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) shoes with red rosettes. Anne was present, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) considerately
toned herself down, so as not to too seriously damage her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother's
appearance. At moments during the ceremony she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had a distressing sense
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ought not to be born, and was glad to get home again.

<p/>The interest excited in the village, though real, was hardly enough to
bring a serious blush to the face of coyness. Neighbours' minds had
become so saturated by the abundance of showy military and regal incident
lately vouchsafed to them, that the wedding of middle-aged civilians was
of small account, excepting in so far that it solved the question whether
or not Mrs. Garland would consider herself too genteel to mate with a
grinder of corn.

<p/>In the evening, Loveday's heart was made glad by seeing the baked and
boiled in rapid process of consumption by the kitchenful of people
assembled for that purpose. Three-quarters of an hour were sufficient to
banish for ever his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) fears as to spoilt food. The provisions being the
cause of the assembly, and not its consequence, it had been determined to
get all that would not keep consumed on that day, even if highways and
hedges had to be searched for operators. And, in addition to the poor
and needy, every cottager's daughter known to the miller was invited, and
told to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) lover from camp--an expedient which, for letting
daylight into the inside of full platters, was among the most happy ever
known.

<p/>While Mr. and Mrs. Loveday, Anne, and Bob were standing in the parlour,
discussing the progress of the entertainment in the next room, John, who
had not been down all day, entered the house and looked in upon them
through the open door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How's this, John? Why didn't you come before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had to see the captain, and--other duties,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the trumpet-major, in a
tone which showed no great zeal for explanations.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, come in, however,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>continued the miller, as his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) son remained with
his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) hand on the door-post, surveying them reflectively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot stay long,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John, advancing. <div class="bookquote">``The Route is come, and we
are going away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Going away! Where to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Exonbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Friday morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All of you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; some to-morrow and some next day. The King goes next week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry for this,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller, not expressing half his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sorrow by
the simple utterance. <div class="bookquote">``I wish you could have been here to-day, since
this is the case,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) added, looking at the horizon through the window.

<p/>Mrs. Loveday also expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) regret, which seemed to remind the
trumpet-major of the event of the day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) and tried to
say something befitting the occasion. Anne had not said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was
either sorry or glad, but John Loveday fancied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had looked rather
relieved than otherwise when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) news. His (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) conversation with
Bob on the down made Bob's manner, too, remarkably cool, notwithstanding
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had after all followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) brother's advice, which it was as yet
too soon after the event for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) to rightly value. John did not know why
the sailor had come back, never supposing that it was because he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had
thought better of going, and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) privately, <div class="bookquote">``You didn't overtake
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't try to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are not going to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I shall let her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) drift.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad indeed, Bob; you have been wise,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John heartily.

<p/>Bob, however, still loved Matilda too well to be other than dissatisfied
with John and the event that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had precipitated, which the elder brother
only too promptly perceived; and it made his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) stay that evening of short
duration. Before leaving he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said with some hesitation to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) father,
including Anne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother by his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) glance, <div class="bookquote">``Do you think to come up and
see us off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>The miller answered for them all, and said that of course they would
come. <div class="bookquote">``But you'll step down again between now and then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll try to.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) added after a pause, <div class="bookquote">``In case I should not, remember
that Revalley will sound at half past five; we shall leave about eight.
Next summer, perhaps, we shall come and camp here again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so,''  (<font color='red'><b>father Loveday</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) father and Mrs. Loveday.

<p/>There was something in John's manner which indicated to Anne that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
scarcely intended to come down again; but the others did not notice it,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) departed a few minutes later, in the dusk of
the August evening, leaving Anne still in doubt as to the meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
private meeting with Miss Johnson.

<p/>John Loveday had been going to tell them that on the last night, by an
especial privilege, it would be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) power to come and stay with them
until eleven o'clock, but at the moment of leaving he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) abandoned the
intention. Anne's attitude had chilled him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>), and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) anxious to be
off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) utilized the spare hours of that last night in another way.

<p/>This was by coming down from the outskirts of the camp in the evening,
and seating himself near the brink of the mill-pond as soon as it was
quite dark; where he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) watched the lights in the different windows till one
appeared in Anne's bedroom, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) herself came forward to shut the
casement, with the candle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand. The light shone out upon the
broad and deep mill-head, illuminating to a distinct individuality every
moth and gnat that entered the quivering chain of radiance stretching
across the water towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>), and every bubble or atom of froth that
floated into its width. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) stood for some time looking out, little
thinking what the darkness concealed on the other side of that wide
stream; till at length she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) closed the casement, drew the curtains, and
retreated into the room. Presently the light went out, upon which John
Loveday returned to camp and lay down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) tent.

<p/>The next morning was dull and windy, and the trumpets of the --th sounded
Reveille for the last time on Overcombe Down. Knowing that the Dragoons
were going away, Anne had slept heedfully, and was at once awakened by
the smart notes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) looked out of the window, to find that the miller
was already astir, his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) white form being visible at the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) garden,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) stood motionless, watching the preparations. Anne also looked
on as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could through the dim grey gloom, and soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw the
blue smoke from the cooks' fires creeping fitfully along the ground,
instead of rising in vertical columns, as it had done during the fine
weather season. Then the men began to carry their bedding to the
waggons, and others to throw all refuse into the trenches, till the down
was lively as an ant-hill. Anne did not want to see John Loveday again,
but hearing the household astir, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) began to dress at leisure, looking
out at the camp the while.

<p/>When the soldiers had breakfasted, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw them selling and giving away
their superfluous crockery to the natives who had clustered round; and
then they pulled down and cleared away the temporary kitchens which they
had constructed when they came. A tapping of tent-pegs and wriggling of
picket-posts followed, and soon the cones of white canvas, now almost
become a component part of the landscape, fell to the ground. At this
moment the miller came indoors and asked at the foot of the stairs if
anybody was going up the hill with him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>).

<p/>Anne felt that, in spite of the cloud hanging over John in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mind, it
would ill become the present moment not to see him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) off, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went
downstairs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother, who was already there, though Bob was nowhere
to be seen. Each took an arm of the miller, and thus climbed to the top
of the hill. By this time the men and horses were at the place of
assembly, and, shortly after the mill-party reached level ground, the
troops slowly began to move forward. When the trumpet-major, half buried
in his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) uniform, arms, and horse-furniture, drew near to the spot where
the Lovedays were waiting to see him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) pass, his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) father turned anxiously to
Anne and said, <div class="bookquote">``You will shake hands with John?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne faintly replied <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>and allowed the miller to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) forward on
his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) arm to the trackway, so as to be close to the flank of the
approaching column. It came up, many people on each side grasping the
hands of the troopers in bidding them farewell; and as soon as John
Loveday saw the members of his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) father's household, he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) stretched down his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
hand across his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) right pistol for the same performance. The miller gave
his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>), then Mrs. Loveday gave hers, and then the hand of the trumpet-major
was extended towards Anne. But as the horse did not absolutely stop, it
was a somewhat awkward performance for a young woman to undertake, and,
more on that account than on any other, Anne drew back, and the gallant
trooper passed by without receiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) adieu. Anne's heart reproached
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) for a moment; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thought that, after all, he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) was not going
off to immediate battle, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would in all probability see him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>)
again at no distant date, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hoped that the mystery of his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) conduct
would be explained. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thoughts were interrupted by a voice at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
elbow: <div class="bookquote">``Thank heaven, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'s gone! Now there's a chance for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) turned, and Festus Derriman was standing by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no chance for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said indignantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because there's another left!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The words had slipped out quite unintentionally, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) blushed quickly.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would have given anything to be able to recall them; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) had
heard, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Who?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne went forward to the miller to avoid replying, and Festus caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
no more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has anybody been hanging about Overcombe Mill except Loveday's son the
soldier?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) asked of a comrade.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) son the sailor,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O--his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) son the sailor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus slowly. <div class="bookquote">``Damn his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) son the sailor!''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>XXII. THE TWO HOUSEHOLDS UNITED


<p/>At this particular moment the object of Festus Derriman's fulmination was
assuredly not dangerous as a rival. Bob, after abstractedly watching the
soldiers from the front of the house till they were out of sight, had
gone within doors and seated himself in the mill-parlour, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
father found him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) elbows resting on the table and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) forehead on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
hands, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) eyes being fixed upon a document that lay open before him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What art perusing, Bob, with such a long face?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob sighed, and then Mrs. Loveday and Anne entered. <div class="bookquote">''`Tis only a state-
paper that I fondly thought I should have a use for,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said gloomily.
And, looking down as before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) voice, as if moved inwardly
to go on, and began to read in feeling tones from what proved to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
nullified marriage licence:--

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Timothy Titus Philemon, by permission Bishop of Bristol: To our well-
beloved Robert Loveday, of the parish of Overcombe, Bachelor; and Matilda
Johnson, of the same parish, Spinster. Greeting.'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>Here Anne sighed, but contrived to keep down her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sigh to a mere nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beautiful language, isn't it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob. <div class="bookquote">``I was never greeted like that
afore!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I have often thought it very excellent language myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Loveday.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come to that, the old gentleman will greet thee like it again any day
for a couple of guineas,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller.

<p/>``That's not the point, father! You never could see the real meaning of
these things... Well, then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) goes on: ``Whereas ye are, as it is
alleged, determined to enter into the holy estate of matrimony--<div class="bookquote">'' But
why should I read on? It all means nothing now--nothing, and the
splendid words are all wasted upon air. It seems as if I had been hailed
by some venerable hoary prophet, and had turned away, put the helm hard
up, and wouldn't hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nobody</b></font>)</div><p/>Nobody replied, feeling probably that sympathy could not meet the case,
and Bob went on reading the rest of it to himself, occasionally heaving a
breath like the wind in a ship's shrouds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't set my mind so much upon her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), if I was thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father
at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, folk might call thee a fool, and say thy brains were turning to
water.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob was apparently much struck by this thought, and, instead of
continuing the discourse further, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) carefully folded up the licence,
went out, and walked up and down the garden. It was startlingly apt what
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father had said; and, worse than that, what people would call him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
might be true, and the liquefaction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) brains turn out to be no
fable. By degrees he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) became much concerned, and the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) examined
himself by this new light the more clearly did he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) perceive that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was in
a very bad way.

<p/>On reflection he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) remembered that since Miss Johnson's departure his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
appetite had decreased amazingly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had eaten in meat no more than
fourteen or fifteen ounces a day, but one-third of a quartern pudding on
an average, in vegetables only a small heap of potatoes and half a York
cabbage, and no gravy whatever; which, considering the usual appetite of
a seaman for fresh food at the end of a long voyage, was no small index
of the depression of his (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) mind. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) had waked once every night, and
on one occasion twice. While dressing each morning since the gloomy day
he (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) had not whistled more than seven bars of a hornpipe without stopping
and falling into thought of a most painful kind; and he (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) had told none but
absolutely true stories of foreign parts to the neighbouring villagers
when they saluted and clustered about him (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>), as usual, for anything he (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>)
chose to pour forth--except that story of the whale whose eye was about
as large as the round pond in Derriman's ewe-lease--which was like
tempting fate to set a seal for ever upon his (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) tongue as a traveller. All
this enervation, mental and physical, had been produced by Matilda's
departure.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) also considered what he (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) had lost of the rational amusements of manhood
during these unfortunate days. He (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) might have gone to the neighbouring
fashionable resort every afternoon, stood before Gloucester Lodge till
the King and Queen came out, held his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hand, and enjoyed their
Majesties' smiles at his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) homage all for nothing--watched the
picket-mounting, heard the different bands strike up, observed the staff;
and, above all, have seen the pretty town girls go trip-trip-trip along
the esplanade, deliberately fixing their innocent eyes on the distant
sea, the grey cliffs, and the sky, and accidentally on the soldiers and
himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll raze out her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) image,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) shall make a fool of me no
more.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) resolve resulted in conduct which had elements of real
greatness.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) father, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) found in the mill-loft. <div class="bookquote">''`Tis true,
father, what you say,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) observed: `my brains will turn to bilge-water
if I think of her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) much longer. By the oath of a--navigator, I wish I
could sigh less and laugh more! She (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s gone--why can't I let her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) go, and
be happy? But how begin?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take it careless, my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller, `and lay yourself out to
enjoy snacks and cordials.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--that's a thought!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Baccy is good for`t. So is sperrits. Though I don't advise thee to
drink neat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Baccy--I'd almost forgot it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain Loveday.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) room, hastily untied the package of tobacco that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had
brought home, and began to make use of it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) own way, calling to
David for a bottle of the old household mead that had lain in the cellar
these eleven years. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) was discovered by his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) father three-quarters of an
hour later as a half-invisible object behind a cloud of smoke.

<p/>The miller drew a breath of relief. <div class="bookquote">``Why, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I thought the
house was a-fire!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>``I'm smoking rather fast to drown my reflections, father. <div class="bookquote">``Tis no use to
chaw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mate</b></font>)</div><p/>To tempt his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) attenuated appetite the unhappy mate made David cook an
omelet and bake a seed-cake, the latter so richly compounded that it
opened to the knife like a freckled buttercup. With the same object he (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>)
stuck night-lines into the banks of the mill-pond, and drew up next
morning a family of fat eels, some of which were skinned and prepared for
his (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) breakfast. They were his (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) favourite fish, but such had been his (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>)
condition that, until the moment of making this effort, he (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) had quite
forgotten their existence at his (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) father's back-door.

<p/>In a few days Bob Loveday had considerably improved in tone and vigour.
One other obvious remedy for his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) dejection was to indulge in the society
of Miss Garland, love being so much more effectually got rid of by
displacement than by attempted annihilation. But Loveday's belief that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had offended her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) beyond forgiveness, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) ever-present sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>)
as a woman who by education and antecedents was fitted to adorn a higher
sphere than his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) own, effectually kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) from going near her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) for a long
time, notwithstanding that they were inmates of one house. The reserve
was, however, in some degree broken by the appearance one morning, later
in the season, of the point of a saw through the partition which divided
Anne's room from the Loveday half of the house. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) dined and
supped with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother and the Loveday family, Miss Garland had still
continued to occupy her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) old apartments, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) found it more
convenient there to pursue her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) hobbies of wool-work and of copying her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>)
father's old pictures. The division wall had not as yet been broken
down.

<p/>As the saw worked its way downwards under her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) astonished gaze Anne jumped
up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) drawing; and presently the temporary canvasing and papering
which had sealed up the old door of communication was cut completely
through. The door burst open, and Bob stood revealed on the other side,
with the saw in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your ladyship's pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said, taking off the hat he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had been
working in, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) handsome face expanded into a smile. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't know
this door opened into your private room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, Captain Loveday!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am pulling down the division on principle, as we are now one family.
But I really thought the door opened into your passage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It don't matter; I can get another room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. Father wouldn't let me turn you out. I'll close it up
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>But Anne was so interested in the novelty of a new doorway that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
walked through it, and found herself in a dark low passage which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had
never seen before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It leads to the mill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob. <div class="bookquote">``Would you like to go in and see it at
work? But perhaps you have already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only into the ground floor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come all over it. I am practising as grinder, you know, to help my
father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) along the dark passage, in the side of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) opened a
little trap, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw a great slimy cavern, where the long arms of
the mill-wheel flung themselves slowly and distractedly round, and
splashing water-drops caught the little light that strayed into the
gloomy place, turning it into stars and flashes. A cold mist-laden puff
of air came into their faces, and the roar from within made it necessary
for Anne to shout as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``It is dismal! let us go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob shut the trap, the roar ceased, and they went on to the inner part of
the mill, where the air was warm and nutty, and pervaded by a fog of
flour. Then they ascended the stairs, and saw the stones lumbering round
and round, and the yellow corn running down through the hopper. They
climbed yet further to the top stage, where the wheat lay in bins, and
where long rays like feelers stretched in from the sun through the little
window, got nearly lost among cobwebs and timber, and completed their
course by marking the opposite wall with a glowing patch of gold.

<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) earnestness as an exhibitor Bob opened the bolter, which was
spinning rapidly round, the result being that a dense cloud of flour
rolled out in their faces, reminding Anne that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) complexion was
probably much paler by this time than when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had entered the mill. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) companion for his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) trouble, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would now go down. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) with the same deference as hitherto, and with a sudden and
increasing sense that of all cures for his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) former unhappy passion this
would have been the nicest, the easiest, and the most effectual, if he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
had only been fortunate enough to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) upon easy terms. But Miss
Garland showed no disposition to go further than accept his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) services as a
guide; she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) descended to the open air, shook the flour from her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) like a
bird, and went on into the garden amid the September sunshine, whose rays
lay level across the blue haze which the earth gave forth. The gnats
were dancing up and down in airy companies, the nasturtium flowers shone
out in groups from the dark hedge over which they climbed, and the mellow
smell of the decline of summer was exhaled by everything. Bob followed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) as far as the gate, looked after her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>), thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) as the same girl
who had half encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) years ago, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) seemed so superior to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>); though now they were almost equal she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) apparently thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) beneath
her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>). It was with a new sense of pleasure that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) mind flew to the fact
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) was now an inmate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father's house.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) obsequious bearing was continued during the next week. In the busy
hours of the day they seldom met, but they regularly encountered each
other at meals, and these cheerful occasions began to have an interest
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) quite irrespective of dishes and cups. When Anne entered and
took her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) seat she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was always loudly hailed by Miller Loveday as he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
whetted his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) knife; but from Bob she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) condescended to accept no such
familiar greeting, and they often sat down together as if each had a
blind eye in the direction of the other. Bob sometimes told serious and
correct stories about sea-captains, pilots, boatswains, mates, able
seamen, and other curious fauna of the marine world; but these were
directly addressed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father and Mrs. Loveday, Anne being included at
the clinching-point by a glance only. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) sometimes opened bottles of
sweet cider for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>); but even this did not lead
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) encouraging his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) chat.

<p/>One day when Anne was paring an apple she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was left at table with the
young man. <div class="bookquote">``I have made something for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) looked all over the table; nothing was there save the ordinary
remnants.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O I don't mean that it is here; it is out by the bridge at the
mill-head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arose, and Anne followed with curiosity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) firm
little mouth pouted up to a puzzled shape. On reaching the mossy mill-
head she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had fixed in the keen damp draught which always
prevailed over the wheel an AEolian harp of large size. At present the
strings were partly covered with a cloth. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lifted it, and the wires
began to emit a weird harmony which mingled curiously with the plashing
of the wheel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I made it on purpose for you, Miss Garland,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very warmly, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had never seen anything like such an
instrument before, and it interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It was very thoughtful of you
to make it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) added. <div class="bookquote">``How came you to think of such a thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O I don't know exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) replied, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not care to be
questioned on the point. <div class="bookquote">``I have never made one in my life till now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Every night after this, during the mournful gales of autumn, the strange
mixed music of water, wind, and strings met her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ear, swelling and sinking
with an almost supernatural cadence. The character of the instrument was
far enough removed from anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had hitherto seen of Bob's hobbies;
so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) marvelled pleasantly at the new depths of poetry this
contrivance revealed as existent in that young seaman's nature, and
allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) emotions to flow out yet a little further in the old
direction, notwithstanding her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) late severe resolve to bar them back.

<p/>One breezy night, when the mill was kept going into the small hours, and
the wind was exactly in the direction of the water-current, the music so
mingled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) dreams as to wake her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>): it seemed to rhythmically set
itself to the words, <div class="bookquote">``Remember me! think of me!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was much impressed;
the sounds were almost too touching; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) spoke to Bob the next
morning on the subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How strange it is that you should have thought of fixing that harp where
the water gushes!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) gently observed. <div class="bookquote">``It affects me almost painfully
at night. You are poetical, Captain Bob. But it is too--too sad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will take it away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain Bob promptly. <div class="bookquote">``It certainly is too
sad; I thought so myself. I myself was kept awake by it one night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How came you to think of making such a peculiar thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob, `it is hardly worth saying why. It is not a good place
for such a queer noisy machine; and I'll take it away.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On second thoughts,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, <div class="bookquote">``I should like it to remain a little
longer, because it sets me thinking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) asked with earnest frankness.

<p/>Anne's colour rose fast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, trying to infuse much plain matter-of-fact into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I am led to think of the person who invented it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob seemed unaccountably embarrassed, and the subject was not pursued.
About half-an-hour later he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) again, with something of an
uneasy look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was a little matter I didn't tell you just now, Miss Garland,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``About that harp thing, I mean. I did make it, certainly, but it
was my brother John who asked me to do it, just before he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) went away. John
is very musical, as you know, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said it would interest you; but as
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) didn't ask me to tell, I did not. Perhaps I ought to have, and not
have taken the credit to myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, it is nothing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne quickly. <div class="bookquote">``It is a very incomplete
instrument after all, and it will be just as well for you to take it away
as you first proposed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) would, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) forgot to do it that day; and the following
night there was a high wind, and the harp cried and moaned so movingly
that Anne, whose window was quite near, could hardly bear the sound with
its new associations. John Loveday was present to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mind all night as
an ill-used man; and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not own that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had ill-used him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>).

<p/>The harp was removed next day. Bob, feeling that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) credit for
originality was damaged in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes, by way of recovering it set himself
to paint the summer-house which Anne frequented, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) came out he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) that it was quite his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) own idea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It wanted doing, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, in a neutral tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is just about troublesome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; you can't quite reach up. That's because you are not very tall; is
it not, Captain Loveday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You never used to say things like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, I don't mean that you are much less than tall! Shall I hold the
paint for you, to save your stepping down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, if you would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) took the paint-pot, and stood looking at the brush as it moved up and
down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I shall not sprinkle your fingers,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) observed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) dipped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, that would not matter! You do it very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to hear that you think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But perhaps not quite so much art is demanded to paint a summer-house as
to paint a picture?''

 (<font color='red'><b>a painter</b></font>)</div><p/>Thinking that, as a painter's daughter, and a person of education
superior to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) own, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) spoke with a flavour of sarcasm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) felt humbled
and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You did not use to talk like that to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was perhaps too young then to take any pleasure in giving pain,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
observed daringly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does it give you pleasure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like to give pain to people who have given pain to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said
smartly, without removing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes from the green liquid in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ask your pardon for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't say I meant you--though I did mean you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob looked and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) side face till he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was bewitched into putting
down his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) brush.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was that stupid forgetting of `ee for a time!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Well,
I hadn't seen you for so very long--consider how many years! O, dear
Anne!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said, advancing to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand, `how well we knew one another
when we were children! You was a queen to me then; and so you are now,
and always.''

<p/>Possibly Anne was thrilled pleasantly enough at having brought the truant
village lad to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) feet again; but he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was not to find the situation so
easy as he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) imagined, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand was not to be taken yet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very pretty!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``And only six weeks since Miss
Johnson left.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Zounds, don't say anything about that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>implored Bob. <div class="bookquote">``I swear that I
never--never deliberately loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>)--for a long time together, that is;
it was a sudden sort of thing, you know. But towards you--I have more or
less honoured and respectfully loved you, off and on, all my life. There,
that's true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne retorted quickly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am willing, off and on, to believe you, Captain Robert. But I don't
see any good in your making these solemn declarations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me leave to explain, dear Miss Garland. It is to get you to be
pleased to renew an old promise--made years ago--that you'll think o'
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a word of any promise will I repeat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, I won't urge `ee to-day. Only let me beg of you to get over
the quite wrong notion you have of me; and it shall be my whole endeavour
to fetch your gracious favour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne turned away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) and entered the house, whither in the course of
a quarter of an hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), knocking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) door, and asking to
be let in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was busy; whereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) went away, to come back
again in a short time and receive the same answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have finished painting the summer-house for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said through the
door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot come to see it. I shall be engaged till supper-time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) breathe a heavy sigh and withdraw, murmuring something
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) bad luck in being cut away from the starn like this. But it
was not over yet. When supper-time came and they sat down together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
took upon herself to reprove him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in the
garden.

<p/>Bob made his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) forehead express despair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I beg you this one thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Just let me know your whole
mind. Then I shall have a chance to confess my faults and mend them, or
clear my conduct to your satisfaction.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) answered with quickness, but not loud enough to be heard by the old
people at the other end of the table--<div class="bookquote">``Then, Captain Loveday, I will tell
you one thing, one fault, that perhaps would have been more proper to my
character than to yours. You are too easily impressed by new faces, and
that gives me a _bad opinion_ of you--yes, a _bad opinion_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, that's it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob slowly, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) with the intense respect
of a pupil for a master, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) words being spoken in a manner so precisely
between jest and earnest that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was in some doubt how they were to be
received. <div class="bookquote">``Impressed by new faces. It is wrong, certainly, of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div><p/>The popping of a cork, and the pouring out of strong beer by the miller
with a view to giving it a head, were apparently distractions sufficient
to excuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in not attending further to him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>); and during the remainder
of the sitting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) gentle chiding seemed to be sinking seriously into his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>)
mind. Perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own heart ached to see how silent he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) was; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had
always meant to punish him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>). Day after day for two or three weeks she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
preserved the same demeanour, with a self-control which did justice to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) character. And, on his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) part, considering what he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had to put up
with--how she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eluded him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), snapped him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) off, refused to come out when he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
called her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), refused to see him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wanted to enter the little parlour
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had now appropriated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) private use, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) patience testified
strongly to his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) good-humour.




<p/>XXIII. MILITARY PREPARATIONS ON AN EXTENDED SCALE


<p/>Christmas had passed. Dreary winter with dark evenings had given place
to more dreary winter with light evenings. Rapid thaws had ended in
rain, rain in wind, wind in dust. Showery days had come--the season of
pink dawns and white sunsets; and people hoped that the March weather was
over.

<p/>The chief incident that concerned the household at the mill was that the
miller, following the example of all his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) neighbours, had become a
volunteer, and duly appeared twice a week in a red, long-tailed military
coat, pipe-clayed breeches, black cloth gaiters, a heel-balled helmet-
hat, with a tuft of green wool, and epaulettes of the same colour and
material. Bob still remained neutral. Not being able to decide whether
to enrol himself as a sea-fencible, a local militia-man, or a volunteer,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) simply went on dancing attendance upon Anne. Mrs. Loveday had become
awake to the fact that the pair of young people stood in a curious
attitude towards each other; but as they were never seen with their heads
together, and scarcely ever sat even in the same room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) could not be
sure what their movements meant.

<p/>Strangely enough -LRB-or perhaps naturally enough-RRB-, since entering the
Loveday family herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had gradually grown to think less favourably
of Anne doing the same thing, and reverted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) original idea of
encouraging Festus; this more particularly because he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had of late shown
such perseverance in haunting the precincts of the mill, presumably with
the intention of lighting upon the young girl. But the weather had kept
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mostly indoors.

<p/>One afternoon it was raining in torrents. Such leaves as there were on
trees at this time of year--those of the laurel and other
evergreens--staggered beneath the hard blows of the drops which fell upon
them, and afterwards could be seen trickling down the stems beneath and
silently entering the ground. The surface of the mill-pond leapt up in a
thousand spirts under the same downfall, and clucked like a hen in the
rat-holes along the banks as it undulated under the wind. The only dry
spot visible from the front windows of the mill-house was the inside of a
small shed, on the opposite side of the courtyard. While Mrs. Loveday
was noticing the threads of rain descending across its interior shade,
Festus Derriman walked up and entered it for shelter, which, owing to the
lumber within, it but scantily afforded to a man who would have been a
match for one of Frederick William's Patagonians.

<p/>It was an excellent opportunity for helping on her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) scheme. Anne was in
the back room, and by asking him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) in till the rain was over she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would
bring him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) face to face with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) daughter, whom, as the days went on, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
increasingly wished to marry other than a Loveday, now that the romance
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own alliance with the millet had in some respects worn off. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
was better provided for than before; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was not unhappy; but the plain
fact was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had married beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) beckoned to Festus
through the window-pane; he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) instantly complied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) signal, having in
fact placed himself there on purpose to be noticed; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) knew that Miss
Garland would not be out-of-doors on such a day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good afternoon, Mrs. Loveday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus on entering. <div class="bookquote">``There now--if
I didn't think that's how it would be!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) voice had suddenly warmed to
anger, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) had seen a door close in the back part of the room, a lithe
figure having previously slipped through.

<p/>Mrs. Loveday turned, observed that Anne was gone, and said, <div class="bookquote">``What is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not know.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, nothing, nothing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus crossly. <div class="bookquote">``You know well enough what
it is, ma'am; only you make pretence otherwise. But I'll bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) to
book yet. You shall drop your haughty airs, my charmer! She (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) little
thinks I have kept an account of 'em all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) politely, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Loveday, secretly
pleased at these signs of uncontrollable affection.

<p/>``Don't tell me of politeness or generosity, ma'am! She (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) is more than a
match for me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) regularly gets over me. I have passed by this house
five-and-fifty times since last Martinmas, and this is all my reward
for<div class="bookquote">``t!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will stay till the rain is over, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I don't mind rain. I'm off again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)'s got somebody else in her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
eye!''  (<font color='red'><b>the yeoman</b></font>)</div>And the yeoman went out, slamming the door.

<p/>Meanwhile the slippery object of his (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) hopes had gone along the dark
passage, passed the trap which opened on the wheel, and through the door
into the mill, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) was met by Bob, who looked up from the flour-
shoot inquiringly and said, <div class="bookquote">``You want me, Miss Garland?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I only want to be allowed to stand here a few
minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) to know if she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) meant it, and finding that she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) did,
returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) post. When the mill had rumbled on a little longer he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
came back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) said, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) move, `remember that you are at work,
and have no time to stand close to me.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) bowed and went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) original post again, Anne watching from the
window till Festus should leave. The mill rumbled on as before, and at
last Bob came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) for the third time. ``Now, Bob--' she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On my honour, `tis only to ask a question. Will you walk with me to
church next Sunday afternoon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said. But at this moment the yeoman left the
house, and Anne, to escape further parley, returned to the dwelling by
the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had come.

<p/>Sunday afternoon arrived, and the family was standing at the door waiting
for the church bells to begin. From that side of the house they could
see southward across a paddock to the rising ground further ahead, where
there grew a large elm-tree, beneath whose boughs footpaths crossed in
different directions, like meridians at the pole. The tree was old, and
in summer the grass beneath it was quite trodden away by the feet of the
many trysters and idlers who haunted the spot. The tree formed a
conspicuous object in the surrounding landscape.

<p/>While they looked, a foot soldier in red uniform and white breeches came
along one of the paths, and stopping beneath the elm, took from his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
pocket a paper, which he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) proceeded to nail up by the four corners to the
trunk. He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) drew back, looked at it, and went on his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) way. Bob got his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
glass from indoors and levelled it at the placard, but after looking for
a long time he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) could make out nothing but a lion and a unicorn at the
top. Anne, who was ready for church, moved away from the door, though it
was yet early, and showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) intention of going by way of the elm. The
paper had been so impressively nailed up that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was curious to read it
even at this theological time. Bob took the opportunity of following,
and reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) promise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then walk behind me not at all close,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) replied, immediately dropping behind.

<p/>The ludicrous humility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) manner led her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to add playfully over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
shoulder, <div class="bookquote">``It serves you right, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I deserve anything, but I must take the liberty to say that I hope my
behaviour about Matil--, in forgetting you awhile, will not make ye wish
to keep me _always_ behind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) replied confidentially, ``Why I am so earnest not to be seen with you
is that I may appear to people to be independent of you. Knowing what I
do of your weaknesses I can do no otherwise. You must be schooled into--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>sighed Bob, `you hit me hard--too hard! If ever I do win you
I am sure I shall have fairly earned you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not what you once seemed to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) returned softly. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
quite like to let myself love you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>The last words were not very
audible, and as Bob was behind he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) caught nothing of them, nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) see
how sentimental she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had become all of a sudden. They walked the rest of
the way in silence, and coming to the tree read as follows:--

<p/>ADDRESS TO ALL RANKS AND DESCRIPTIONS OF ENGLISHMEN.

<p/>FRIENDS AND COUNTRYMEN,--The French are now assembling the largest
force that ever was prepared to invade this Kingdom, with the
professed purpose of effecting our complete Ruin and Destruction. They
do not disguise their intentions, as they have often done to other
Countries; but openly boast that they will come over in such Numbers
as cannot be resisted.

<p/>Wherever the French have lately appeared they have spared neither Rich
nor Poor, Old nor Young; but like a Destructive Pestilence have laid
waste and destroyed every Thing that before was fair and flourishing.

<p/>On this occasion no man's service is compelled, but you are invited
voluntarily to come forward in defence of everything that is dear to
you, by entering your Names on the Lists which are sent to the Tything-
man of every Parish, and engaging to act either as _Associated
Volunteers bearing Arms_, _as Pioneers and Labourers_, or as _Drivers
of Waggons_.

<p/>As Associated Volunteers you will be called out only once a week,
unless the actual Landing of the Enemy should render your further
Services necessary.

<p/>As Pioneers or Labourers you will be employed in Breaking up Roads to
hinder the Enemy's advance.

<p/>Those who have Pickaxes, Spades, Shovels, Bill-hooks, or other Working
Implements, are desired to mention them to the Constable or Tything-
man of their Parish, in order that they may be entered on the Lists
opposite their Homes, to be used if necessary...

<p/>It is thought desirable to give you this Explanation, that you may not
be ignorant of the Duties to which you may be called. But if the love
of true Liberty and honest Fame has not ceased to animate the Hearts
of Englishmen, Pay, though necessary, will be the least Part of your
Reward. You will find your best Recompense in having done your Duty
to your King and Country by driving back or destroying your old and
implacable Enemy, envious of your Freedom and Happiness, and therefore
seeking to destroy them; in having protected your Wives and Children
from Death, or worse than Death, which will follow the Success of such
Inveterate Foes.

<p/>ROUSE, therefore, and unite as one man in the best of Causes! United
we may defy the World to conquer us; but Victory will never belong to
those who are slothful and unprepared. -LCB-207-RCB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go and join at once!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob.

<p/>Anne turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), all the playfulness gone from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``I wish we
lived in the north of England, Bob, so as to be further away from where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'ll land!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) murmured uneasily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where we are would be Paradise to me, if you would only make it so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not right to talk so lightly at such a serious time,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
thoughtfully returned, going on towards the church.

<p/>On drawing near, they saw through the boughs of a clump of intervening
trees, still leafless, but bursting into buds of amber hue, a glittering
which seemed to be reflected from points of steel. In a few moments they
heard above the tender chiming of the church bells the loud voice of a
man giving words of command, at which all the metallic points suddenly
shifted like the bristles of a porcupine, and glistened anew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis the drilling,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>said Loveday. <div class="bookquote">``They drill now between the services,
you know, because they can't get the men together so readily in the week.
It makes me feel that I ought to be doing more than I am!''

 (<font color='red'><b>recruits</b></font>)</div><p/>When they had passed round the belt of trees, the company of recruits
became visible, consisting of the able-bodied inhabitants of the hamlets
thereabout, more or less known to Bob and Anne. They were assembled on
the green plot outside the churchyard-gate, dressed in their common
clothes, and the sergeant who had been putting them through their drill
was the man who nailed up the proclamation. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was now engaged in
untying a canvas money-bag, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drew forth a handful of
shillings, giving one to each man in payment for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attendance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Men, I dismissed ye too soon--parade, parade again, I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried.
<div class="bookquote">``My watch is fast, I find. There's another twenty minutes afore the
worship of God commences. Now all of you that ha'n't got firelocks, fall
in at the lower end. Eyes right and dress!''

 (<font color='red'><b>every man</b></font>)</div><p/>As every man was anxious to see how the rest stood, those at the end of
the line pressed forward for that purpose, till the line assumed the form
of a bow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at ye now! Why, you are all a crooking in! Dress, dress!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They dressed forthwith; but impelled by the same motive they soon resumed
their former figure, and so they were despairingly permitted to remain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I hope you'll have a little patience,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the sergeant, as he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>)
stood in the centre of the arc, `and pay strict attention to the word of
command, just exactly as I give it out to ye; and if I should go wrong, I
shall be much obliged to any friend who'll put me right again, for I have
only been in the army three weeks myself, and we are all liable to
mistakes.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So we be, so we be,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the line heartily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tention, the whole, then. Poise fawlocks! Very well done!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, what must we do that haven't got no firelocks!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the lower
end of the line in a helpless voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, was ever such a question! Why, you must do nothing at all, but
think _how_ you'd poise 'em _if_ you had 'em. You middle men, that are
armed with hurdle-sticks and cabbage-stumps just to make-believe, must of
course use 'em as if they were the real thing. Now then, cock fawlocks!
Present! Fire! -LRB-Pretend to, I mean, and the same time throw yer
imagination into the field o' battle.-RRB- Very good--very good indeed;
except that some of you were a _little_ too soon, and the rest a _little_
too late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, sergeant, can I fall out, as I am master-player in the choir,
and my bass-viol strings won't stand at this time o' year, unless they be
screwed up a little before the passon comes in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you think of such trifles as churchgoing at such a time as this,
when your own native country is on the point of invasion?''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the
sergeant sternly. <div class="bookquote">``And, as you know, the drill ends three minutes afore
church begins, and that's the law, and it wants a quarter of an hour yet.
Now, at the word _Prime_, shake the powder -LRB-supposing you've got it-RRB- into
the priming-pan, three last fingers behind the rammer; then shut your
pans, drawing your right arm nimble-like towards your body. I ought to
have told ye before this, that at _Hand your katridge_, seize it and
bring it with a quick motion to your mouth, bite the top well off, and
don't swaller so much of the powder as to make ye hawk and spet instead
of attending to your drill. What's that man a-saying of in the rear
rank?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, sir, `tis Anthony Cripplestraw, wanting to know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>)'s to bite
off his (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) katridge, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) haven't a tooth left in 's head?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Man! Why, what's your genius for war? Hold it up to your right-hand
man's mouth, to be sure, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nip it off for ye. Well, what have
you to say, Private Tremlett? Don't ye understand English?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask yer pardon, sergeant; but what must we infantry of the awkward squad
do if Boney comes afore we get our firelocks?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Take a pike, like the rest of the incapables. You'll find a store of
them ready in the corner of the church tower. Now then--Shoulder--r--r--r--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, they be tinging in the passon!''  (<font color='red'><b>David</b></font>)</div>exclaimed David, Miller Loveday's
man, who also formed one of the company, as the bells changed from
chiming all three together to a quick beating of one. The whole line
drew a breath of relief, threw down their arms, and began running off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, I must dismiss ye,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the sergeant. ``Come back--come
back! Next drill is Tuesday afternoon at four. And, mind, if your
masters won't let ye leave work soon enough, tell me, and I'll write a
line to Gover`ment! <div class="bookquote">``Tention! To the right--left wheel, I mean--no,
no--right wheel. Mar--r--r--rch!''

 (<font color='red'><b>some men</b></font>)</div><p/>Some wheeled to the right and some to the left, and some obliging men,
including Cripplestraw, tried to wheel both ways.

<p/>``Stop, stop; try again! <div class="bookquote">``Cruits and comrades, unfortunately when I'm in
a hurry I can never remember my right hand from my left, and never could
as a boy. You must excuse me, please. Practice makes perfect, as the
saying is; and, much as I've learnt since I `listed, we always find
something new. Now then, right wheel! march! halt! Stand at ease!
dismiss! I think that's the order o`t, but I'll look in the Gover`ment
book afore Tuesday.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LCB-211-RCB-

<p/>Many of the company who had been drilled preferred to go off and spend
their shillings instead of entering the church; but Anne and Captain Bob
passed in. Even the interior of the sacred edifice was affected by the
agitation of the times. The religion of the country had, in fact,
changed from love of God to hatred of Napoleon Buonaparte; and, as if to
remind the devout of this alteration, the pikes for the pikemen -LRB-all
those accepted men who were not otherwise armed-RRB- were kept in the church
of each parish. There, against the wall, they always stood--a whole
sheaf of them, formed of new ash stems, with a spike driven in at one
end, the stick being preserved from splitting by a ferule. And there
they remained, year after year, in the corner of the aisle, till they
were removed and placed under the gallery stairs, and thence ultimately
to the belfry, where they grew black, rusty, and worm-eaten, and were
gradually stolen and carried off by sextons, parish clerks, whitewashers,
window-menders, and other church servants for use at home as rake-stems,
benefit-club staves, and pick-handles, in which degraded situations they
may still occasionally be found.

<p/>But in their new and shining state they had a terror for Anne, whose eyes
were involuntarily drawn towards them as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sat at Bob's side during the
service, filling her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) with bloody visions of their possible use not far
from the very spot on which they were now assembled. The sermon, too,
was on the subject of patriotism; so that when they came out she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) began to
harp uneasily upon the probability of their all being driven from their
homes.

<p/>Bob assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) that with the sixty thousand regulars, the militia
reserve of a hundred and twenty thousand, and the three hundred thousand
volunteers, there was not much to fear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I sometimes have a fear that poor John will be killed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) continued
after a pause. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is sure to be among the first that will have to face
the invaders, and the trumpeters get picked off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is the same chance for him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) as for the others,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--yes--the same chance, such as it is. You have never liked John
since that affair of Matilda Johnson, have you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) quickly asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob timidly, `as it is a ticklish time for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), would it not
be worth while to make up any differences before the crash comes?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have nothing to make up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, with some distress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) still
fully believed the trumpet-major to have smuggled away Miss Johnson
because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) own interest in that lady, which must have made his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
professions to herself a mere pastime; but that very conduct had in it
the curious advantage to herself of setting Bob free.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since John has been gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>continued her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) companion, <div class="bookquote">``I have found out
more of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) meaning, and of what he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) really had to do with that woman's
flight. Did you know that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had anything to do with it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) got her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to go away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked at Bob with surprise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was not exasperated with John, and
yet he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) knew so much as this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said; `what did it mean?''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did not explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) then; but the possibility of John's death,
which had been newly brought home to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) by the military events of the
day, determined him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to get poor John's character cleared. Reproaching
himself for letting her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) remain so long with a mistaken idea of him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), Bob
went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father as soon as they got home, and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) to get Mrs.
Loveday to tell Anne the true reason of John's objection to Miss Johnson
as a sister-in-law.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thinks it is because they were old lovers new met, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wants
to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) exclaimed to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father in conclusion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then _that's_ the meaning of the split between Miss Nancy and Jack,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, were they any more than common friends?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>asked Bob uneasily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not on her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) side, perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we must do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>replied Bob, painfully conscious that common
justice to John might bring them into hazardous rivalry, yet determined
to be fair. <div class="bookquote">``Tell it all to Mrs. Loveday, and get her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) to tell Anne.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>XXIV. A LETTER, A VISITOR, AND A TIN BOX


<p/>The result of the explanation upon Anne was bitter self-reproach. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
was so sorry at having wronged the kindly soldier that next morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
went by herself to the down, and stood exactly where his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) tent had covered
the sod on which he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) had lain so many nights, thinking what sadness he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
must have suffered because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) at the time of packing up and going
away. After that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wiped from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes the tears of pity which had
come there, descended to the house, and wrote an impulsive letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>),
in which occurred the following passages, indiscreet enough under the
circumstances:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I find all justice, all rectitude, on your side, John; and all
impertinence, all inconsiderateness, on mine. I am so much convinced
of your honour in the whole transaction, that I shall for the future
mistrust myself in everything. And if it be possible, whenever I
differ from you on any point I shall take an hour's time for
consideration before I say that I differ. If I have lost your
friendship, I have only myself to thank for it; but I sincerely hope
that you can forgive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>After writing this she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went to the garden, where Bob was shearing the
spring grass from the paths. <div class="bookquote">``What is John's direction?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said,
holding the sealed letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exonbury Barracks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>Bob faltered, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) countenance sinking.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) and went indoors. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) came in, later in the day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
passed the door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) empty sitting-room and saw the letter on the
mantelpiece. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) disliked the sight of it. Hearing voices in the other
room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) entered and found Anne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother there, talking to
Cripplestraw, who had just come in with a message from Squire Derriman,
requesting Miss Garland, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) valued the peace of mind of an old and
troubled man, to go at once and see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) said, not liking the risk that such a visit involved.

<p/>An hour later Cripplestraw shambled again into the passage, on the same
errand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maister's very poorly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hopes that you'll come, Mis`ess Anne. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
wants to see `ee very particular about the French.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne would have gone in a moment, but for the fear that some one besides
the farmer might encounter her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) answered as before.

<p/>Another hour passed, and the wheels of a vehicle were heard. Cripplestraw
had come for the third time, with a horse and gig; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) was dressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>)
best clothes, and brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) on this occasion a basket containing
raisins, almonds, oranges, and sweet cakes. Offering them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) as a
gift from the old farmer, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) request for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to accompany
him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>), the gig and best mare having been sent as an additional inducement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe the old gentleman is in love with you, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why couldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) drive down himself to see me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>Anne inquired of
Cripplestraw.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wants you at the house, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Mr. Festus with him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)'s away to Budmouth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I may come and meet you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's my letter--what shall I do about that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, instead of
answering him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Take my letter to the post-office, and you may come,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) added.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said yes and went out, Cripplestraw retreating to the door till she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
should be ready.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What letter is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only one to John,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I have asked him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to forgive my
suspicions. I could do no less.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want to marry _him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)_?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Loveday</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Loveday bluntly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) will take that letter as an encouragement. Can't you see that
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) will, you foolish girl?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne did see instantly. <div class="bookquote">``Of course!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Tell Robert that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>)
need not go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) room to secure the letter. It was gone from the
mantelpiece, and on inquiry it was found that the miller, seeing it
there, had sent David with it to Budmouth hours ago. Anne said nothing,
and set out for Oxwell Hall with Cripplestraw.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``William,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Loveday to the miller when Anne was gone and Bob had
resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) work in the garden, `did you get that letter sent off on
purpose?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I did. I wanted to make sure of it. John likes her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and now
`twill be made up; and why shouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) marry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)? I'll start him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) in
business, if so be she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll have him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is likely to marry Festus Derriman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to marry anybody but John,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller doggedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is in love with Bob, and has been for years, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) with
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) wife triumphantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In love with Bob, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>repeated Loveday.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), going off and leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) reflections.

<p/>When Anne reached the hall she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found old Mr. Derriman in his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) customary
chair. His (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) complexion was more ashen, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) movement in rising at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
entrance, putting a chair and shutting the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), were much the
same as usual.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God you've come, my dear girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) said earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, you don't
trip across to read to me now! Why did ye cost me so much to fetch you?
Fie! A horse and gig, and a man's time in going three times. And what I
sent ye cost a good deal in Budmouth market, now everything is so dear
there, and `twould have cost more if I hadn't bought the raisins and
oranges some months ago, when they were cheaper. I tell you this because
we are old friends, and I have nobody else to tell my troubles to. But I
don't begrudge anything to ye since you've come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not much pleased to come, even now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What can make you
so seriously anxious to see me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well, you be a good girl and true; and I've been thinking that of all
people of the next generation that I can trust, you are the best. <div class="bookquote">``Tis
my bonds and my title-deeds, such as they be, and the leases, you know,
and a few guineas in packets, and more than these, my will, that I have
to speak about. Now do ye come this way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, such things as those!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) returned, with surprise. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
understand those things at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``There's nothing to understand. ``Tis just this. The French will be here
within two months; that's certain. I have it on the best authority, that
the army at Boulogne is ready, the boats equipped, the plans laid, and
the First Consul only waits for a tide. Heaven knows what will become o'
the men o' these parts! But most likely the women will he (<font color='blue'><b>Consul</b></font>) spared. Now
I'll show <div class="bookquote">``ee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) led her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) across the hall to a stone staircase of semi-circular plan,
which conducted to the cellars.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Down here?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said.

<p/>``Yes; I must trouble ye to come down here. I have thought and thought
who is the woman that can best keep a secret for six months, and I say,
``Anne Garland.<div class="bookquote">'' You won't be married before then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne Garland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>murmured the young woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't expect ye to keep a close tongue after such a thing as that.
But it will not be necessary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When they reached the bottom of the steps he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) struck a light from a tinder-
box, and unlocked the middle one of three doors which appeared in the
whitewashed wall opposite. The rays of the candle fell upon the vault
and sides of a long low cellar, littered with decayed woodwork from other
parts of the hall, among the rest stair-balusters, carved finials,
tracery panels, and wainscoting. But what most attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eye was a
small flagstone turned up in the middle of the floor, a heap of earth
beside it, and a measuring-tape. Derriman went to the corner of the
cellar, and pulled out a clamped box from under the straw. <div class="bookquote">``You be
rather heavy, my dear, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) said, affectionately addressing the box as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) lifted it. <div class="bookquote">``But you are going to be put in a safe place, you know, or
that rascal will get hold of ye, and carry ye off and ruin me.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) then
with some difficulty lowered the box into the hole, raked in the earth
upon it, and lowered the flagstone, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) was a long time in fixing to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) satisfaction. Miss Garland, who was romantically interested, helped
him (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) to brush away the fragments of loose earth; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) had scattered
over the floor a little of the straw that lay about, they again ascended
to upper air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this all, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just a moment longer, honey. Will you come into the great parlour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) thither.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If anything happens to me while the fighting is going on--it may be on
these very fields--you will know what to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) resumed. ``But first
please sit down again, there's a dear, whilst I write what's in my head.
See, there's the best paper, and a new quill that I've afforded myself
for<div class="bookquote">``t.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a strange business! I don't think I much like it, Mr. Derriman,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, seating herself.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) had by this time begun to write, and murmured as he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) wrote--

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Twenty-three and a half from N.W. Sixteen and three-quarters from
N.E.'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--There, that's all. Now I seal it up and give it to you to keep
safe till I ask ye for it, or you hear of my being trampled down by the
enemy.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) asked, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) received the paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clk! Ha! ha! Why, that's the distance of the box from the two corners
of the cellar. I measured it before you came. And, my honey, to make
all sure, if the French soldiery are after ye, tell your mother the
meaning on't, or any other friend, in case they should put ye to death,
and the secret be lost. But that I am sure I hope they won't do, though
your pretty face will be a sad bait to the soldiers. I often have wished
you was my daughter, honey; and yet in these times the less cares a man
has the better, so I am glad you bain't. Shall my man drive you home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, much depressed by the words he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) had uttered. <div class="bookquote">``I can
find my way. You need not trouble to come down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then take care of the paper. And if you outlive me, you'll find I have
not forgot you.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>XXV. FESTUS SHOWS HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) LOVE


<p/>Festus Derriman had remained in the Royal watering-place all that day,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) horse being sick at stables; but, wishing to coax or bully from his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>)
uncle a remount for the coming summer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) set off on foot for Oxwell
early in the evening. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) drew near to the village, or rather to the
hall, which was a mile from the village, he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) overtook a slim, quick-eyed
woman, sauntering along at a leisurely pace. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was fashionably dressed
in a green spencer, with ``Mameluke' sleeves, and wore a velvet Spanish
hat and feather.

<p/>``Good afternoon t`ye, ma``am,'' said Festus, throwing a sword-and-pistol
air into his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) greeting. <div class="bookquote">``You are out for a walk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I _am_ out for a walk, captain,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady, who had criticized him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)
from the crevice of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eye, without seeming to do much more than
continue her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) demure look forward, and gave the title as a sop to his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)
apparent character.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From the town?--I'd swear it, ma'am; `pon my honour I would!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am from the town, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you are a visitor! I know every one of the regular inhabitants; we
soldiers are in and out there continually. Festus Derriman, Yeomanry
Cavalry, you know. The fact is, the watering-place is under our charge;
the folks will be quite dependent upon us for their deliverance in the
coming struggle. We hold our lives in our hands, and theirs, I may say,
in our pockets. What made you come here, ma'am, at such a critical
time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see that it is such a critical time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is, though; and so you'd say if you was as much mixed up with the
military affairs of the nation as some of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The lady smiled. <div class="bookquote">``The King is coming this year, anyhow,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never!''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus firmly. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, you are one of the attendants at court
perhaps, come on ahead to get the King's chambers ready, in case Boney
should not land?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I am connected with the theatre, though not just at the
present moment. I have been out of luck for the last year or two; but I
have fetched up again. I join the company when they arrive for the
season.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Festus surveyed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with interest. <div class="bookquote">``Faith! and is it so? Well, ma'am,
what part do you play?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am mostly the leading lady--the heroine,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, drawing herself up
with dignity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll come and have a look at ye if all's well, and the landing is put
off--hang me if I don't!--Hullo, hullo, what do I see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne Garland</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) eyes were stretched towards a distant field, which Anne Garland was
at that moment hastily crossing, on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) way from the hall to Overcombe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must be off. Good-day to ye, dear creature!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) exclaimed, hurrying
forward.

<p/>The lady said, <div class="bookquote">``O, you droll monster!''  (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) smiled and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)
stride ahead.

<p/>Festus bounded on over the hedge, across the intervening patch of green,
and into the field which Anne was still crossing. In a moment or two she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
looked back, and seeing the well-known Herculean figure of the yeoman
behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt rather alarmed, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) determined to show no
difference in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) outward carriage. But to maintain her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) natural gait was
beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) powers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) spasmodically quickened her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) pace; fruitlessly,
however, for he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) gained upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and when within a few strides of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Well, my darling!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Anne started off at a run.

<p/>Festus was already out of breath, and soon found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) was not likely
to overtake her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). On she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went, without turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head, till an unusual
noise behind compelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to look round. His (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) face was in the act of
falling back; he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) swerved on one side, and dropped like a log upon a
convenient hedgerow-bank which bordered the path. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) lay quite
still.

<p/>Anne was somewhat alarmed; and after standing at gaze for two or three
minutes, drew nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>), a step and a half at a time, wondering and
doubting, as a meek ewe draws near to some strolling vagabond who flings
himself on the grass near the flock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) is in a swoon!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) murmured.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heart beat quickly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) looked around. Nobody was in sight; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
advanced a step nearer still and observed him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) again. Apparently his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) face
was turning to a livid hue, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) breathing had become obstructed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis not a swoon; `tis apoplexy!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, in deep distress. <div class="bookquote">``I ought
to untie his (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) neck.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was afraid to do this, and only drew a
little closer still.

<p/>Miss Garland was now within three feet of him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>), whereupon the senseless
man, who could hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) breath no longer, sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) feet and darted
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>), saying, <div class="bookquote">``Ha! ha! a scheme for a kiss!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) arm slipping round her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) neck; but, twirling about with
amazing dexterity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) wriggled from his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) embrace and ran away along the
field. The force with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) had extricated herself was sufficient to
throw Festus upon the grass, and by the time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) got upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) legs
again she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) was many yards off. Uttering a word which was not exactly a
blessing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) immediately gave chase; and thus they ran till Anne entered
a meadow divided down the middle by a brook about six feet wide. A
narrow plank was thrown loosely across at the point where the path
traversed this stream, and when Anne reached it she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) at once scampered
over. At the other side she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head to gather the probabilities
of the situation, which were that Festus Derriman would overtake her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) even
now. By a sudden forethought she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) stooped, seized the end of the plank,
and endeavoured to drag it away from the opposite bank. But the weight
was too great for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to do more than slightly move it, and with a
desperate sigh she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ran on again, having lost many valuable seconds.

<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) attempt, though ineffectual in dragging it down, had been enough
to unsettle the little bridge; and when Derriman reached the middle,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) did half a minute later, the plank turned over on its edge,
tilting him (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) bodily into the river. The water was not remarkably deep,
but as the yeoman fell flat on his (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) stomach he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) was completely immersed;
and it was some time before he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) could drag himself out. When he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) arose,
dripping on the bank, and looked around, Anne had vanished from the mead.
Then Festus's eyes glowed like carbuncles, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) gave voice to fearful
imprecations, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) fist in the soft summer air towards Anne, in a
way that was terrible for any maiden to behold. Wading back through the
stream, he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) walked along its bank with a heavy tread, the water running
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) coat-tails, wrists, and the tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) ears, in silvery
dribbles, that sparkled pleasantly in the sun. Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) hastened away,
and went round by a by-path to the hall.

<p/>Meanwhile the author of his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) troubles was rapidly drawing nearer to the
mill, and soon, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) inexpressible delight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw Bob coming to meet
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had heard the flounce, and, feeling more secure from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
pursuer, had dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) pace to a quick walk. No sooner did she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) reach
Bob than, overcome by the excitement of the moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) flung herself
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) arms. Bob instantly enclosed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in an embrace so very thorough
that there was no possible danger of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) falling, whatever degree of
exhaustion might have given rise to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) somewhat unexpected action; and
in this attitude they silently remained, till it was borne in upon Anne
that the present was the first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) life that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had ever been in
such a position. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face then burnt like a sunset, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not know
how to look up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>). Feeling at length quite safe, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) suddenly
resolved not to give way to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) first impulse to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) the whole of
what had happened, lest there should be a dreadful quarrel and fight
between Bob and the yeoman, and great difficulties caused in the Loveday
family on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) account, the miller having important wheat transactions
with the Derrimans.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem frightened, dearest Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob tenderly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I saw a man I did not like the look of, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
inclined to follow me. But, worse than that, I am troubled about the
French. O Bob! I am afraid you will be killed, and my mother, and John,
and your father, and all of us hunted down!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I have told you, dear little heart, that it cannot be. We shall
drive 'em into the sea after a battle or two, even if they land, which I
don't believe they will. We've got ninety sail of the line, and though
it is rather unfortunate that we should have declared war against Spain
at this ticklish time, there's enough for all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>And Bob went into
elaborate statistics of the navy, army, militia, and volunteers, to
prolong the time of holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had done speaking he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) drew
rather a heavy sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter, Bob?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't been yet to offer myself as a sea-fencible, and I ought to
have done it long ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are only one. Surely they can do without you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) arose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) restful position, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eye
catching his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) with a shamefaced expression of having given way at last.
Loveday drew from his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) pocket a paper, and said, as they slowly walked on,
<div class="bookquote">``Here's something to make us brave and patriotic. I bought it in
Budmouth. Isn't it a stirring picture?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a hieroglyphic profile of Napoleon. The hat represented a maimed
French eagle; the face was ingeniously made up of human carcases, knotted
and writhing together in such directions as to form a physiognomy; a
band, or stock, shaped to resemble the English Channel, encircled his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>)
throat, and seemed to choke him (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) epaulette was a hand tearing a
cobweb that represented the treaty of peace with England; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) ear was
a woman crouching over a dying child. -LCB-225-RCB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is dreadful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I don't like to see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had recovered from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) emotion, and walked along beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) with a
grave, subdued face. Bob did not like to assume the privileges of an
accepted lover and draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand through his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) arm; for, conscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
naturally belonged to a politer grade than his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) own, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) feared lest her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
exhibition of tenderness were an impulse which cooler moments might
regret. A perfect Paul-and-Virginia life had not absolutely set in for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) as yet, and it was not to be hastened by force. When they had passed
over the bridge into the mill-front they saw the miller standing at the
door with a face of concern.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since you have been gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) said, 'a Government man has been here, and
to all the houses, taking down the numbers of the women and children, and
their ages and the number of horses and waggons that can be mustered, in
case they have to retreat inland, out of the way of the invading army.''

<p/>The little family gathered themselves together, all feeling the crisis
more seriously than they liked to express. Mrs. Loveday thought how
ridiculous a thing social ambition was in such a conjuncture as this, and
vowed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) would leave Anne to love where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would. Anne, too,
forgot the little peculiarities of speech and manner in Bob and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
father, which sometimes jarred for a moment upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) more refined sense,
and was thankful for their love and protection in this looming trouble.

<p/>On going upstairs she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) remembered the paper which Farmer Derriman had
given her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and searched in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) bosom for it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not find it
there. <div class="bookquote">``I must have left it on the table,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said to herself. It did
not matter; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) remembered every word. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) took a pen and wrote a
duplicate, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) put safely away.

<p/>But Anne was wrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had, after all, placed the paper where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
supposed, and there it ought to have been. But in escaping from Festus,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) feigned apoplexy, it had fallen out upon the grass. Five minutes
after that event, when pursuer and pursued were two or three fields
ahead, the gaily-dressed woman whom the yeoman had overtaken, peeped
cautiously through the stile into the corner of the field which had been
the scene of the scramble; and seeing the paper she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) climbed over, secured
it, loosened the wafer without tearing the sheet, and read the memorandum
within. Unable to make anything of its meaning, the saunterer put it in
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pocket, and, dismissing the matter from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind, went on by the by-
path which led to the back of the mill. Here, behind the hedge, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
stood and surveyed the old building for some time, after which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
meditatively turned, and retraced her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) steps towards the Royal watering-
place.




<p/>XXVI. THE ALARM


<p/>The night which followed was historic and memorable. Mrs. Loveday was
awakened by the boom of a distant gun: she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) told the miller, and they
listened awhile. The sound was not repeated, but such was the state of
their feelings that Mr. Loveday went to Bob's room and asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had
heard it. Bob was wide awake, looking out of the window; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had heard
the ominous sound, and was inclined to investigate the matter. While the
father and son were dressing they fancied that a glare seemed to be
rising in the sky in the direction of the beacon hill. Not wishing to
alarm Anne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother, the miller assured them that Bob and himself
were merely going out of doors to inquire into the cause of the report,
after which they plunged into the gloom together. A few steps' progress
opened up more of the sky, which, as they had thought, was indeed
irradiated by a lurid light; but whether it came from the beacon or from
a more distant point they were unable to clearly tell. They pushed on
rapidly towards higher ground.

<p/>Their excitement was merely of a piece with that of all men at this
critical juncture. Everywhere expectation was at fever heat. For the
last year or two only five-and-twenty miles of shallow water had divided
quiet English homesteads from an enemy's army of a hundred and fifty
thousand men. We had taken the matter lightly enough, eating and
drinking as in the days of Noe, and singing satires without end. We
punned on Buonaparte and his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) gunboats, chalked his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) effigy on
stage-coaches, and published the same in prints. Still, between these
bursts of hilarity, it was sometimes recollected that England was the
only European country which had not succumbed to the mighty little man
who was less than human in feeling, and more than human in will; that our
spirit for resistance was greater than our strength; and that the Channel
was often calm. Boats built of wood which was greenly growing in its
native forest three days before it was bent as wales to their sides, were
ridiculous enough; but they might be, after all, sufficient for a single
trip between two visible shores.

<p/>The English watched Buonaparte in these preparations, and Buonaparte
watched the English. At the distance of Boulogne details were lost, but
we were impressed on fine days by the novel sight of a huge army moving
and twinkling like a school of mackerel under the rays of the sun. The
regular way of passing an afternoon in the coast towns was to stroll up
to the signal posts and chat with the lieutenant on duty there about the
latest inimical object seen at sea. About once a week there appeared in
the newspapers either a paragraph concerning some adventurous English
gentleman who had sailed out in a pleasure-boat till he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lay near enough
to Boulogne to see Buonaparte standing on the heights among his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) marshals;
or else some lines about a mysterious stranger with a foreign accent,
who, after collecting a vast deal of information on our resources, had
hired a boat at a southern port, and vanished with it towards France
before his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) intention could be divined.

<p/>In forecasting his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) grand venture, Buonaparte postulated the help of
Providence to a remarkable degree. Just at the hour when his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) troops were
on board the flat-bottomed boats and ready to sail, there was to be a
great fog, that should spread a vast obscurity over the length and
breadth of the Channel, and keep the English blind to events on the other
side. The fog was to last twenty-four hours, after which it might clear
away. A dead calm was to prevail simultaneously with the fog, with the
twofold object of affording the boats easy transit and dooming our ships
to lie motionless. Thirdly, there was to be a spring tide, which should
combine its manoeuvres with those of the fog and calm.

<p/>Among the many thousands of minor Englishmen whose lives were affected by
these tremendous designs may be numbered our old acquaintance Corporal
Tullidge, who sported the crushed arm, and poor old Simon Burden, the
dazed veteran who had fought at Minden. Instead of sitting snugly in the
settle of the Old Ship, in the village adjoining Overcombe, they were
obliged to keep watch on the hill. They made themselves as comfortable
as was possible in the circumstances, dwelling in a hut of clods and
turf, with a brick chimney for cooking. Here they observed the nightly
progress of the moon and stars, grew familiar with the heaving of moles,
the dancing of rabbits on the hillocks, the distant hoot of owls, the
bark of foxes from woods further inland; but saw not a sign of the enemy.
As, night after night, they walked round the two ricks which it was their
duty to fire at a signal--one being of furze for a quick flame, the other
of turf, for a long, slow radiance--they thought and talked of old times,
and drank patriotically from a large wood flagon that was filled every
day.

<p/>Bob and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father soon became aware that the light was from the beacon.
By the time that they reached the top it was one mass of towering flame,
from which the sparks fell on the green herbage like a fiery dew; the
forms of the two old men being seen passing and repassing in the midst of
it. The Lovedays, who came up on the smoky side, regarded the scene for
a moment, and then emerged into the light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who goes there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Corporal</b></font>)</div>said Corporal Tullidge, shouldering a pike with his (<font color='blue'><b>Corporal</b></font>)
sound arm. <div class="bookquote">``O, `tis neighbour Loveday!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you get your signal to fire it from the east?''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller
hastily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; from Abbotsea Beach.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are not to go by a coast signal!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Chok' it all, wasn't the Lord-Lieutenant's direction, whenever you see
Rainbarrow's Beacon burn to the nor`east`ard, or Haggardon to the
nor`west`ard, or the actual presence of the enemy on the shore?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But is he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt o`t! The beach light is only just gone down, and Simon heard
the guns even better than I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Hark, hark! I hear <div class="bookquote">``em!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bob.

<p/>They listened with parted lips, the night wind blowing through Simon
Burden's few teeth as through the ruins of Stonehenge. From far down on
the lower levels came the noise of wheels and the tramp of horses upon
the turnpike road.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there must be something in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Loveday/Miller Loveday/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Miller Loveday gravely. <div class="bookquote">``Bob,
we'll go home and make the women-folk safe, and then I'll don my
soldier's clothes and be off. God knows where our company will
assemble!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They hastened down the hill, and on getting into the road waited and
listened again. Travellers began to come up and pass them in vehicles of
all descriptions. It was difficult to attract their attention in the dim
light, but by standing on the top of a wall which fenced the road Bob was
at last seen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) cried to a butcher who was flying past in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
cart, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) wife sitting behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) without a bonnet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The French have landed!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, without drawing rein.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>shouted Bob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In West Bay; and all Budmouth is in uproar!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the voice, now
faint in the distance.

<p/>Bob and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father hastened on till they reached their own house. As
they had expected, Anne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother, in common with most of the
people, were both dressed, and stood at the door bonneted and shawled,
listening to the traffic on the neighbouring highway, Mrs. Loveday having
secured what money and small valuables they possessed in a huge pocket
which extended all round her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) waist, and added considerably to her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) weight
and diameter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis true enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Loveday</b></font>)</div>said the miller: `he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>)'s come! You and Anne and the
maid must be off to Cousin Jim's at King's-Bere, and when you get there
you must do as they do. I must assemble with the company.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou`st better run to the church, and take a pike before they be all
gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>The horse was put into the gig, and Mrs. Loveday, Anne, and the servant-
maid were hastily packed into the vehicle, the latter taking the reins;
David's duties as a fighting-man forbidding all thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) domestic
offices now. Then the silver tankard, teapot, pair of candlesticks like
Ionic columns, and other articles too large to be pocketed were thrown
into a basket and put up behind. Then came the leave-taking, which was
as sad as it was hurried. Bob kissed Anne, and there was no affectation
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) receiving that mark of affection as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said through her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tears,
<div class="bookquote">``God bless you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>At last they moved off in the dim light of dawn,
neither of the three women knowing which road they were to take, but
trusting to chance to find it.

<p/>As soon as they were out of sight Bob went off for a pike, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
father, first new-flinting his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) firelock, proceeded to don his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) uniform,
pipe-claying his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) breeches with such cursory haste as to bespatter his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
black gaiters with the same ornamental compound. Finding when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was
ready that no bugle had as yet sounded, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) went with David to the cart-
house, dragged out the waggon, and put therein some of the most useful
and easily-handled goods, in case there might be an opportunity for
conveying them away. By the time this was done and the waggon pushed
back and locked in, Bob had returned with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) weapon, somewhat mortified
at being doomed to this low form of defence. The miller gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) son a
parting grasp of the hand, and arranged to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) at King's-Bere at the
first opportunity if the news were true; if happily false, here at their
own house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bother it all!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bere</b></font>) exclaimed, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bere</b></font>) stock of flints.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got no ammunition: not a blessed round!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what's the use of going?''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) son.

<p/>The miller paused. <div class="bookquote">``O, I'll go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps somebody will lend
me a little if I get into a hot corner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lend ye a little! Father, you was always so simple!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob
reproachfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--I can bagnet a few, anyhow,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller.

<p/>The bugle had been blown ere this, and Loveday the father disappeared
towards the place of assembly, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) empty cartridge-box behind him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Bob
seized a brace of loaded pistols which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had brought home from the ship,
and, armed with these and a pike, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) locked the door and sallied out
again towards the turnpike road.

<p/>By this time the yeomanry of the district were also on the move, and
among them Festus Derriman, who was sleeping at his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) uncle's, and had been
awakened by Cripplestraw. About the time when Bob and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father were
descending from the beacon the stalwart yeoman was standing in the stable-
yard adjusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) straps, while Cripplestraw saddled the horse. Festus
clanked up and down, looked gloomily at the beacon, heard the retreating
carts and carriages, and called Cripplestraw to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>), who came from the
stable leading the horse at the same moment that Uncle Benjy peeped
unobserved from a mullioned window above their heads, the distant light
of the beacon fire touching up his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) features to the complexion of an old
brass clock-face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think that before I start, Cripplestraw,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus, whose lurid
visage was undergoing a bleaching process curious to look upon, `you
shall go on to Budmouth, and make a bold inquiry whether the cowardly
enemy is on shore as yet, or only looming in the bay.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd go in a moment, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said the other, `if I hadn't my bad leg again.
I should have joined my company afore this; but they said at last drill
that I was too old. So I shall wait up in the hay-loft for tidings as
soon as I have packed you off, poor gentleman!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do such alarms as these, Cripplestraw, ever happen without foundation?
Buonaparte is a wretch, a miserable wretch, and this may be only a false
alarm to disappoint such as me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But sometimes there are false alarms?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, yes. There was a pretended sally o' gunboats last year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And was there nothing else pretended--something more like this, for
instance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cripplestraw/Anthony Cripplestraw/Anthony</b></font>)</div><p/>Cripplestraw shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I notice yer modesty, Mr. Festus, in
making light of things. But there never was, sir. You may depend upon
it he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)'s come. Thank God, my duty as a Local don't require me to go to
the front, but only the valiant men like my master. Ah, if Boney could
only see `ee now, sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boney</b></font>)'d know too well there is nothing to be got from
such a determined skilful officer but blows and musket-balls!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes. Cripplestraw, if I ride off to Budmouth and meet 'em, all my
training will be lost. No skill is required as a forlorn hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True; that's a point, sir. You would outshine 'em all, and be picked
off at the very beginning as a too-dangerous brave man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if I stay here and urge on the faint-hearted ones, or get up into
the turret-stair by that gateway, and pop at the invaders through the
loophole, I shouldn't be so completely wasted, should I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would not, Mr. Derriman. But, as you was going to say next, the
fire in yer veins won't let ye do that. You are valiant; very good: you
don't want to husband yer valiance at home. The arg`ment is plain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If my birth had been more obscure,''  (<font color='red'><b>the yeoman</b></font>)</div>murmured the yeoman, `and I had only
been in the militia, for instance, or among the humble pikemen, so much
wouldn't have been expected of me--of my fiery nature. Cripplestraw, is
there a drop of brandy to be got at in the house? I don't feel very
well.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear nephew,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman from above, whom neither of the
others had as yet noticed, <div class="bookquote">``I haven't any spirits opened--so unfortunate!
But there's a beautiful barrel of crab-apple cider in draught; and
there's some cold tea from last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, is he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) listening?''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus, staring up. <div class="bookquote">``Now I warrant how
glad he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) is to see me forced to go--called out of bed without breakfast,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) quite safe, and sure to escape because he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)'s an old
man!--Cripplestraw, I like being in the yeomanry cavalry; but I wish I
hadn't been in the ranks; I wish I had been only the surgeon, to stay in
the rear while the bodies are brought back to him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>)--I mean, I should have
thrown my heart at such a time as this more into the labour of restoring
wounded men and joining their shattered limbs together--u-u-ugh!--more
than I can into causing the wounds--I am too humane, Cripplestraw, for
the ranks!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) companion, depressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) spirits to a kindred
level. <div class="bookquote">``And yet, such is fate, that, instead of joining men's limbs
together, you'll have to get your own joined--poor young sojer!--all
through having such a warlike soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>murmured Festus, and paused. <div class="bookquote">``You can't think how strange I feel
here, Cripplestraw,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) continued, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) hand upon the centre
buttons of his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) waistcoat. <div class="bookquote">``How I do wish I was only the surgeon!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) slowly mounted, and Uncle Benjy, in the meantime, sang to himself as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) looked on, '_Twen-ty-three and half from N.W._ _Six-teen and three-
quar-ters from N.E._'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that old mummy singing?''  (<font color='red'><b>N.W.</b></font>)</div>said Festus savagely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only a hymn for preservation from our enemies, dear nephew,''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>meekly
replied the farmer, who had heard the remark. '_Twen-ty-three and half
from N.W_.''

<p/>Festus allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) horse to move on a few paces, and then turned again,
as if struck by a happy invention. <div class="bookquote">``Cripplestraw,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) began, with an
artificial laugh, ``I am obliged to confess, after all--I must see her (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)!
<div class="bookquote">``Tisn't nature that makes me draw back--`tis love. I must go and look
for her (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A woman, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I didn't want to confess it; but `tis a woman. Strange that I should be
drawn so entirely against my natural wish to rush at <div class="bookquote">``em!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cripplestraw/Anthony Cripplestraw/Anthony</b></font>)</div><p/>Cripplestraw, seeing which way the wind blew, found it advisable to blow
in harmony. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, now at last I see, sir! Spite that few men live that
be worthy to command ye; spite that you could rush on, marshal the troops
to victory, as I may say; but then--what of it? there's the unhappy fate
of being smit with the eyes of a woman, and you are unmanned! Maister
Derriman, who is himself, when he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s got a woman round his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) neck like a
millstone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is something like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel the case. Be you valiant?--I know, of course, the words being a
matter of form--be you valiant, I ask? Yes, of course. Then don't you
waste it in the open field. Hoard it up, I say, sir, for a higher class
of war--the defence of yer adorable lady. Think what you owe her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) at this
terrible time! Now, Maister Derriman, once more I ask ye to cast off
that first haughty wish to rush to Budmouth, and to go where your mis`ess
is defenceless and alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will, Cripplestraw, now you put it like that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank ye, thank ye heartily, Maister Derriman. Go now and hide with
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But can I? Now, hang flattery!--can a man hide without a stain? Of
course I would not hide in any mean sense; no, not I!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you be in love, `tis plain you may, since it is not your own life,
but another's, that you are concerned for, and you only save your own
because it can't be helped.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis true, Cripplestraw, in a sense. But will it be understood that
way? Will they see it as a brave hiding?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, sir, if you had not been in love I own to ye that hiding would look
queer, but being to save the tears, groans, fits, swowndings, and perhaps
death of a comely young woman, yer principle is good; you honourably
retreat because you be too gallant to advance. This sounds strange, ye
may say, sir; but it is plain enough to less fiery minds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div><p/>Festus did for a moment try to uncover his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) teeth in a natural smile, but
it died away. <div class="bookquote">``Cripplestraw, you flatter me; or do you mean it? Well,
there's truth in it. I am more gallant in going to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) than in marching
to the shore. But we cannot be too careful about our good names, we
soldiers. I must not be seen. I'm off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cripplestraw/Anthony Cripplestraw/Anthony</b></font>)</div><p/>Cripplestraw opened the hurdle which closed the arch under the portico
gateway, and Festus passed under, Uncle Benjamin singing, _Twen-ty-three
and a half from N.W._ with a sort of sublime ecstasy, feeling, as Festus
had observed, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) money was safe, and that the French would not
personally molest an old man in such a ragged, mildewed coat as that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wore, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had taken the precaution to borrow from a scarecrow in one
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fields for the purpose.

<p/>Festus rode on full of his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) intention to seek out Anne, and under cover of
protecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) retreat accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to King's-Bere, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Bere</b></font>) knew the
Lovedays had relatives. In the lane he (<font color='blue'><b>Bere</b></font>) met Granny Seamore, who, having
packed up all her (<font color='blue'><b>Seamore</b></font>) possessions in a small basket, was placidly retreating
to the mountains till all should be over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, granny, have ye seen the French?''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>asked Festus.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Seamore</b></font>) said, looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) through her (<font color='blue'><b>Seamore</b></font>) brazen spectacles. <div class="bookquote">``If I
had I shouldn't ha' seed thee!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Faugh!''  (<font color='red'><b>the yeoman</b></font>)</div>replied the yeoman, and rode on. Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) reached the old
road, which he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) had intended merely to cross and avoid, his (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) countenance
fell. Some troops of regulars, who appeared to be dragoons, were
rattling along the road. Festus hastened towards an opposite gate, so as
to get within the field before they should see him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>); but, as ill-luck
would have it, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) got inside, a party of six or seven of his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)
own yeomanry troop were straggling across the same field and making for
the spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) was. The dragoons passed without seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>); but when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) turned out into the road again it was impossible to retreat towards
Overcombe village because of the yeomen. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) rode straight on, and
heard them coming at his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) heels. There was no other gate, and the highway
soon became as straight as a bowstring. Unable thus to turn without
meeting them, and caught like an eel in a water-pipe, Festus drew nearer
and nearer to the fateful shore. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) did not relinquish hope. Just
ahead there were cross-roads, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) might have a chance of slipping down
one of them without being seen. On reaching the spot he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)
was not alone. A horseman had come up the right-hand lane and drawn
rein. It was an officer of the German legion, and seeing Festus he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) held
up his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) hand. Festus rode up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) and saluted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It ist false report!''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>said the officer.

<p/>Festus was a man again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) felt that nothing was too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>). The
officer, after some explanation of the cause of alarm, said that he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was
going across to the road which led by the moor, to stop the troops and
volunteers converging from that direction, upon which Festus offered to
give information along the Casterbridge road. The German crossed over,
and was soon out of sight in the lane, while Festus turned back upon the
way by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) had come. The party of yeomanry cavalry was rapidly
drawing near, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) soon recognized among them the excited voices of
Stubb of Duddle Hole, Noakes of Muckleford, and other comrades of his (<font color='blue'><b>Noakes</b></font>)
orgies at the hall. It was a magnificent opportunity, and Festus drew
his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) sword. When they were within speaking distance he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) reined round his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)
charger's head to Budmouth and shouted, <div class="bookquote">``On, comrades, on! I am waiting
for you. You have been a long time getting up with me, seeing the
glorious nature of our deeds to-day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well said, Derriman, well said!''  (<font color='red'><b>the riders</b></font>)</div>replied the foremost of the riders.
<div class="bookquote">``Have you heard anything new?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>)'s here with his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) tens of thousands, and that we are to ride
to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) sword in hand as soon as we have assembled in the town ahead
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O Lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>Noakes</b></font>)</div>said Noakes, with a slight falling of the lower jaw.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The man who quails now is unworthy of the name of yeoman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus,
still keeping ahead of the other troopers and holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) sword to the
sun. <div class="bookquote">``O Noakes, fie, fie! You begin to look pale, man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Faith, perhaps you'd look pale,''  (<font color='red'><b>Noakes</b></font>)</div>said Noakes, with an envious glance
upon Festus's daring manner, `if you had a wife and family depending upon
ye!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll take three frog-eating Frenchmen single-handed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>rejoined Derriman,
still flourishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) sword.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They have as good swords as you; as you will soon find,''  (<font color='red'><b>the yeomen</b></font>)</div>said another of
the yeomen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If they were three times armed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus--`ay, thrice three times--I
would attempt 'em three to one. How do you feel now, my old friend
Stubb?'' -LRB-turning to another of the warriors.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``O, friend Stubb! no
bouncing health to our lady-loves in Oxwell Hall this summer as last. Eh,
Brownjohn?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Brownjohn</b></font>)</div>said Brownjohn gloomily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No rattling dinners at Stacie's Hotel, and the King below with his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
staff. No wrenching off door-knockers and sending 'em to the bakehouse
in a pie that nobody calls for. Weeks of cut-and-thrust work rather!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fight how we may we shan't get rid of the cursed tyrant before autumn,
and many thousand brave men will lie low before it's done,''  (<font color='red'><b>a yeoman</b></font>)</div>remarked a
young yeoman with a calm face, who meant to do his (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) duty without much
talking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No grinning matches at Mai-dun Castle this summer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>Festus resumed; `no
thread-the-needle at Greenhill Fair, and going into shows and driving the
showman crazy with cock-a-doodle-doo!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does it make you seem just a trifle uncomfortable, Noakes? Keep up your
spirits, old comrade. Come, forward! we are only ambling on like so many
donkey-women. We have to get into Budmouth, join the rest of the troop,
and then march along the coast west`ard, as I imagine. At this rate we
shan't be well into the thick of battle before twelve o'clock. Spur on,
comrades. No dancing on the green, Lockham, this year in the moonlight!
You was tender upon that girl; gad, what will become o' her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in the
struggle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, Derriman,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>expostulated Lockham--`this is all very well, but
I don't care for `t. I am as ready to fight as any man, but--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps when you get into battle, Derriman, and see what it's like, your
courage will cool down a little,''  (<font color='red'><b>any man</b></font>)</div>added Noakes on the same side, but with
secret admiration of Festus's reckless bravery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be bayoneted first,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus. <div class="bookquote">``Now let's rally, and on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div><p/>Since Festus was determined to spur on wildly, the rest of the yeomen did
not like to seem behindhand, and they rapidly approached the town. Had
they been calm enough to reflect, they might have observed that for the
last half-hour no carts or carriages had met them on the way, as they had
done further back. It was not till the troopers reached the turnpike
that they learnt what Festus had known a quarter of an hour before. At
the intelligence Derriman sheathed his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) sword with a sigh; and the party
soon fell in with comrades who had arrived there before them, whereupon
the source and details of the alarm were boisterously discussed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, didn't you know of the mistake till now?''  (<font color='red'><b>the new-comers</b></font>)</div>asked one of these of
the new-comers. <div class="bookquote">``Why, when I was dropping over the hill by the cross-
roads I looked back and saw that man talking to the messenger, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
must have told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the truth.''  (<font color='red'><b>The speaker</b></font>)</div>The speaker pointed to Festus. They
turned their indignant eyes full upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>). That he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) had sported with
their deepest feelings, while knowing the rumour to be baseless, was soon
apparent to all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beat him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) black and blue with the flat of our blades!''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>shouted two or
three, turning their horses' heads to drop back upon Derriman, in which
move they were followed by most of the party.

<p/>But Festus, foreseeing danger from the unexpected revelation, had already
judiciously placed a few intervening yards between himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) fellow-
yeomen, and now, clapping spurs to his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) horse, rattled like thunder and
lightning up the road homeward. His (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) ready flight added hotness to their
pursuit, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) rode and looked fearfully over his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) shoulder he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) could
see them following with enraged faces and drawn swords, a position which
they kept up for a distance of more than a mile. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) had the
satisfaction of seeing them drop off one by one, and soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)
panting charger remained alone on the highway.




<p/>XXVII. DANGER TO ANNE


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) stopped and reflected how to turn this rebuff to advantage. Baulked
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) project of entering the watering-place and enjoying
congratulations upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) patriotic bearing during the advance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) sulkily
considered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) might be able to make some use of his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) enforced
retirement by riding to Overcombe and glorifying himself in the eyes of
Miss Garland before the truth should have reached that hamlet. Having
thus decided he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) spurred on in a better mood.

<p/>By this time the volunteers were on the march, and as Derriman ascended
the road he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) met the Overcombe company, in which trudged Miller Loveday
shoulder to shoulder with the other substantial householders of the place
and its neighbourhood, duly equipped with pouches, cross-belts,
firelocks, flint-boxes, pickers, worms, magazines, priming-horns, heel-
ball, and pomatum. There was nothing to be gained by further suppression
of the truth, and briefly informing them that the danger was not so
immediate as had been supposed, Festus galloped on. At the end of
another mile he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) met a large number of pikemen, including Bob Loveday,
whom the yeoman resolved to sound upon the whereabouts of Anne. The
circumstances were such as to lead Bob to speak more frankly than he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
might have done on reflection, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) told Festus the direction in which
the women had been sent. Then Festus informed the group that the report
of invasion was false, upon which they all turned to go homeward with
greatly relieved spirits.

<p/>Bob walked beside Derriman's horse for some distance. Loveday had
instantly made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) mind to go and look for the women, and ease their
anxiety by letting them know the good news as soon as possible. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
said nothing of this to Festus during their return together; nor did
Festus tell Bob that he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) also had resolved to seek them out, and by
anticipating every one else in that enterprise, make of it a glorious
opportunity for bringing Miss Garland to her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) senses about him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) still
resented the ducking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) had received at her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) hands, and was not
disposed to let that insult pass without obtaining some sort of sweet
revenge.

<p/>As soon as they had parted Festus cantered on over the hill, meeting on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) way the Longpuddle volunteers, sixty rank and file, under Captain
Cunningham; the Casterbridge company, ninety strong -LRB-known as the
``Consideration Company' in those days-RRB-, under Captain Strickland; and
others--all with anxious faces and covered with dust. Just passing the
word to them and leaving them at halt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strickland</b></font>) proceeded rapidly onward in the
direction of King's-Bere. Nobody appeared on the road for some time,
till after a ride of several miles he (<font color='blue'><b>Bere</b></font>) met a stray corporal of volunteers,
who told Festus in answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) inquiry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) had certainly passed no
gig full of women of the kind described. Believing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) had missed
them by following the highway, Derriman turned back into a lane along
which they might have chosen to journey for privacy's sake,
notwithstanding the badness and uncertainty of its track. Arriving again
within five miles of Overcombe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) at length heard tidings of the
wandering vehicle and its precious burden, which, like the Ark when sent
away from the country of the Philistines, had apparently been left to the
instincts of the beast that drew it. A labouring man, just at daybreak,
had seen the helpless party going slowly up a distant drive, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
pointed out.

<p/>No sooner had Festus parted from this informant than he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) beheld Bob
approaching, mounted on the miller's second and heavier horse. Bob
looked rather surprised, and Festus felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) coming glory in danger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They went down that lane,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) said, signifying precisely the opposite
direction to the true one. <div class="bookquote">``I, too, have been on the look-out for
missing friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div><p/>As Festus was riding back there was no reason to doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) information,
and Loveday rode on as misdirected. Immediately that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) was out of sight
Festus reversed his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) course, and followed the track which Anne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
companions were last seen to pursue.

<p/>This road had been ascended by the gig in question nearly two hours
before the present moment. Molly, the servant, held the reins, Mrs.
Loveday sat beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>), and Anne behind. Their progress was but slow,
owing partly to Molly's want of skill, and partly to the steepness of the
road, which here passed over downs of some extent, and was rarely or
never mended. It was an anxious morning for them all, and the beauties
of the early summer day fell upon unheeding eyes. They were too anxious
even for conjecture, and each sat thinking her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own thoughts, occasionally
glancing westward, or stopping the horse to listen to sounds from more
frequented roads along which other parties were retreating. Once, while
they listened and gazed thus, they saw a glittering in the distance, and
heard the tramp of many horses. It was a large body of cavalry going in
the direction of the King's watering-place, the same regiment of
dragoons, in fact, which Festus had seen further on in its course. The
women in the gig had no doubt that these men were marching at once to
engage the enemy. By way of varying the monotony of the journey Molly
occasionally burst into tears of horror, believing Buonaparte to be in
countenance and habits precisely what the caricatures represented him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>).
Mrs. Loveday endeavoured to establish cheerfulness by assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
companions of the natural civility of the French nation, with whom
unprotected women were safe from injury, unless through the casual
excesses of soldiery beyond control. This was poor consolation to Anne,
whose mind was more occupied with Bob than with herself, and a miserable
fear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would never again see him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) alive so paled her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face and
saddened her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) gaze forward, that at last her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother said, <div class="bookquote">``Who was you
thinking of, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>Anne's only reply was a look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother, with
which a tear mingled.

<p/>Molly whipped the horse, by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) quickened his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) pace for five yards,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) again fell into the perverse slowness that showed how fully
conscious he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was of being the master-mind and chief personage of the
four. Whenever there was a pool of water by the road he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) turned aside to
drink a mouthful, and remained there his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) own time in spite of Molly's tug
at the reins and futile fly-flapping on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) rump. They were now in the
chalk district, where there were no hedges, and a rough attempt at
mending the way had been made by throwing down huge lumps of that glaring
material in heaps, without troubling to spread it or break them abroad.
The jolting here was most distressing, and seemed about to snap the
springs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How that wheel do wamble,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly</b></font>)</div>said Molly at last. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had scarcely spoken
when the wheel came off, and all three were precipitated over it into the
road.

<p/>Fortunately the horse stood still, and they began to gather themselves
up. The only one of the three who had suffered in the least from the
fall was Anne, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was only conscious of a severe shaking which had
half stupefied her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) for the time. The wheel lay flat in the road, so that
there was no possibility of driving further in their present plight. They
looked around for help. The only friendly object near was a lonely
cottage, from its situation evidently the home of a shepherd.

<p/>The horse was unharnessed and tied to the back of the gig, and the three
women went across to the house. On getting close they found that the
shutters of all the lower windows were closed, but on trying the door it
opened to the hand. Nobody was within; the house appeared to have been
abandoned in some confusion, and the probability was that the shepherd
had fled on hearing the alarm. Anne now said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt the effects
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) fall too severely to be able to go any further just then, and it
was agreed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) should be left there while Mrs. Loveday and Molly
went on for assistance, the elder lady deeming Molly too young and vacant-
minded to be trusted to go alone. Molly suggested taking the horse, as
the distance might be great, each of them sitting alternately on his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) back
while the other led him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) by the head. This they did, Anne watching them
vanish down the white and lumpy road.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) then looked round the room, as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could do so by the light
from the open door. It was plain, from the shutters being closed, that
the shepherd had left his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) house before daylight, the candle and
extinguisher on the table pointing to the same conclusion. Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
remained, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes occasionally sweeping the bare, sunny expanse of down,
that was only relieved from absolute emptiness by the overturned gig hard
by. The sheep seemed to have gone away, and scarcely a bird flew across
to disturb the solitude. Anne had risen early that morning, and leaning
back in the withy chair, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had placed by the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) soon fell
into an uneasy doze, from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was awakened by the distant tramp of
a horse. Feeling much recovered from the effects of the overturn, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
eagerly rose and looked out. The horse was not Miller Loveday's, but a
powerful bay, bearing a man in full yeomanry uniform.

<p/>Anne did not wait to recognize further; instantly re-entering the house,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) shut the door and bolted it. In the dark she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sat and listened: not a
sound. At the end of ten minutes, thinking that the rider if he (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) were not
Festus had carelessly passed by, or that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) were Festus he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) had not
seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) crept softly upstairs and peeped out of the window.
Excepting the spot of shade, formed by the gig as before, the down was
quite bare. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) then opened the casement and stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha, young madam! There you are! I knew `ee! Now you are caught!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>came
like a clap of thunder from a point three or four feet beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and
turning down her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) frightened eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) beheld Festus Derriman lurking close
to the wall. His (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) attention had first been attracted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) shutting the
door of the cottage; then by the overturned gig; and after making sure,
by examining the vehicle, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) was not mistaken in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) identity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>)
had dismounted, led his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) horse round to the side, and crept up to entrap
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/>Anne started back into the room, and remained still as a stone. Festus
went on--``Come, you must trust to me. The French have landed. I have
been trying to meet with you every hour since that confounded trick you
played me. You threw me into the water. Faith, it was well for you I
didn't catch ye then! I should have taken a revenge in a better way than
I shall now. I mean to have that kiss of ye. Come, Miss Nancy; do you
hear?--<div class="bookquote">``Tis no use for you to lurk inside there. You'll have to turn out
as soon as Boney comes over the hill--Are you going to open the door, I
say, and speak to me in a civil way? What do you think I am, then, that
you should barricade yourself against me as if I was a wild beast or
Frenchman? Open the door, or put out your head, or do something; or `pon
my soul I'll break in the door!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>It occurred to Anne at this point of the tirade that the best policy
would be to temporize till somebody should return, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
head and face, now grown somewhat pale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus. <div class="bookquote">``Now I can talk to you. Come, my dear,
will you open the door? Why should you be afraid of me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not altogether afraid of you; I am safe from the French here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said
Anne, not very truthfully, and anxiously casting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes over the vacant
down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then let me tell you that the alarm is false, and that no landing has
been attempted. Now will you open the door and let me in? I am tired. I
have been on horseback ever since daylight, and have come to bring you
the good tidings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) doubted the news.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I cannot let you in,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) murmured, after a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dash my wig, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) cried, his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) face flaming up, <div class="bookquote">``I'll find a way to
get in! Now, don't you provoke me! You don't know what I am capable of.
I ask you again, will you open the door?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you wish it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have told you I want to sit down; and I want to ask you a question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can ask me from where you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot ask you properly. It is about a serious matter: whether you
will accept my heart and hand. I am not going to throw myself at your
feet; but I ask you to do your duty as a woman, namely, give your solemn
word to take my name as soon as the war is over and I have time to attend
to you. I scorn to ask it of a haughty hussy who will only speak to me
through a window; however, I put it to you for the last time, madam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>anybody</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no sign on the down of anybody's return, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'll
think of it, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have thought of it long enough; I want to know. Will you or won't
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; I think I will.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) might be buying
personal safety too dearly by shuffling thus, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) would spread the
report that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>), and cause endless complication. <div class="bookquote">``No,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I have changed my mind. I cannot accept you, Mr. Derriman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's how you play with me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) exclaimed, stamping. '<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>one
moment; <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the next. Come, you don't know what you refuse. That old
hall is my uncle's own, and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) has nobody else to leave it to. As soon
as he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)'s dead I shall throw up farming and start as a squire. And now,<div class="bookquote">''
he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) added with a bitter sneer, `what a fool you are to hang back from such
a chance!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, I don't value it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) who would make it yours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It may not lie in your power to do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What--has the old fellow been telling you his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) affairs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why do you mistrust me? Now, after this will you open the door,
and show that you treat me as a friend if you won't accept me as a lover?
I only want to sit and talk to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would trust him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>); it seemed almost impossible that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
could harm her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) retired from the window and went downstairs. When
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand was upon the bolt of the door, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mind misgave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Instead of
withdrawing it she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) remained in silence where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was, and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) began again--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to unfasten it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne did not speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, dash my wig, I will get at you! You've tried me beyond endurance.
One kiss would have been enough that day in the mead; now I'll have
forty, whether you will or no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) flung himself against the door; but as it was bolted, and had in
addition a great wooden bar across it, this produced no effect. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was
silent for a moment, and then the terrified girl heard him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) attempt the
shuttered window. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ran upstairs and again scanned the down. The
yellow gig still lay in the blazing sunshine, and the horse of Festus
stood by the corner of the garden--nothing else was to be seen. At this
moment there came to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ear the noise of a sword drawn from its
scabbard; and, peeping over the window-sill, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tormentor drive
his (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) sword between the joints of the shutters, in an attempt to rip them
open. The sword snapped off in his (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) hand. With an imprecation he (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) pulled
out the piece, and returned the two halves to the scabbard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha! ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) cried, catching sight of the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">''`Tis only a
joke, you know; but I'll get in all the same. All for a kiss! But never
mind, we'll do it yet!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) spoke in an affectedly light tone, as if
ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) previous resentful temper; but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could see by the livid
back of his (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) neck that he (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) was brimful of suppressed passion. <div class="bookquote">``Only a
jest, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``How are we going to do it now? Why, in
this way. I go and get a ladder, and enter at the upper window where my
love is. And there's the ladder lying under that corn-rick in the first
enclosed field. Back in two minutes, dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) ran off, and was lost to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) view.




<p/>XXVIII. ANNE DOES WONDERS


<p/>Anne fearfully surveyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) position. The upper windows of the cottage
were of flimsiest lead-work, and to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) out would be hopeless. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
felt that not a moment was to be lost in getting away. Running
downstairs she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) opened the door, and then it occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) terrified
understanding that there would be no chance of escaping him (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) by flight
afoot across such an extensive down, since he (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) might mount his (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) horse and
easily ride after her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). The animal still remained tethered at the corner
of the garden; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could release him (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) and frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) away before
Festus returned, there would not be quite such odds against her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
accordingly unhooked the horse by reaching over the bank, and then,
pulling off her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) muslin neckerchief, flapped it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) eyes to startle
him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>). But the gallant steed did not move or flinch; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tried again, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) seemed rather pleased than otherwise. At this moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heard a cry
from the cottage, and turning, beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) adversary approaching round the
corner of the building.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought I should tole out the mouse by that trick!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Festus
exultingly. Instead of going for a ladder, he (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) had simply hidden himself
at the back to tempt her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) down.

<p/>Poor Anne was now desperate. The bank on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) stood was level with
the horse's back, and the creature seemed quiet as a lamb. With a
determination of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was capable in emergencies, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) seized the
rein, flung herself upon the sheepskin, and held on by the mane. The
amazed charger lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) head, sniffed, wrenched his (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) ears hither and
thither, and started off at a frightful speed across the down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, my heart and limbs!''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus under his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) breath, as, thoroughly
alarmed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) gazed after her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) on Champion! She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll break her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) neck,
and I shall be tried for manslaughter, and disgrace will be brought upon
the name of Derriman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Champion</b></font>)</div><p/>Champion continued to go at a stretch-gallop, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Champion</b></font>) did nothing worse.
Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Champion</b></font>) plunged or reared, Derriman's fears might have been verified, and
Anne have come with deadly force to the ground. But the course was good,
and in the horse's speed lay a comparative security. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was scarcely
shaken in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) precarious half-horizontal position, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was awed to
see the grass, loose stones, and other objects pass her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes like strokes
whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) opened them, which was only just for a second at intervals
of half a minute; and to feel how wildly the stirrups swung, and that
what struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knee was the bucket of the carbine, and that it was a
pistol-holster which hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) arm.

<p/>They quickly cleared the down, and Anne became conscious that the course
of the horse was homeward. As soon as the ground began to rise towards
the outer belt of upland which lay between her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and the coast, Champion,
now panting and reeking with moisture, lessened his (<font color='blue'><b>Champion</b></font>) speed in sheer
weariness, and proceeded at a rapid jolting trot. Anne felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
could not hold on half so well; the gallop had been child's play compared
with this. They were in a lane, ascending to a ridge, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) made up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mind for a fall. Over the ridge rose an animated spot, higher and
higher; it turned out to be the upper part of a man, and the man to be a
soldier. Such was Anne's attitude that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) only got an occasional
glimpse of him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>); and, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) feared that he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) might be a Frenchman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
feared the horse more than the enemy, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had feared Festus more than
the horse. Anne had energy enough left to cry, <div class="bookquote">``Stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Champion</b></font>); stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Champion</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>as
the soldier drew near.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>), astonished at the sight of a military horse with a bundle of drapery
across his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) back, had already placed himself in the middle of the lane,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) now held out his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) arms till his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) figure assumed the form of a Latin
cross planted in the roadway. Champion drew near, swerved, and stood
still almost suddenly, a check sufficient to send Anne slipping down his (<font color='blue'><b>Champion</b></font>)
flank to the ground. The timely friend stepped forward and helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) feet, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was John Loveday.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you hurt?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said hastily, having turned quite pale at seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
fall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O no; not a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, gathering herself up with forced briskness,
to make light of the misadventure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how did you get in such a place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, he (<font color='blue'><b>Champion</b></font>)'s gone!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) exclaimed, instead of replying, as Champion swept
round John Loveday and cantered off triumphantly in the direction of
Oxwell, a performance which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) followed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how did you come upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Champion</b></font>) back, and whose horse is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--cannot tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div><p/>John looked steadily at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), saying nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you come here?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Is it true that the French have not
landed at all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite true; the alarm was groundless. I'll tell you all about it. You
look very tired. You had better sit down a few minutes. Let us sit on
this bank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to the slope indicated, and continued, still as if his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
thoughts were more occupied with the mystery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) recent situation than
with what he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was saying: <div class="bookquote">``We arrived at Budmouth Barracks this morning,
and are to lie there all the summer. I could not write to tell father we
were coming. It was not because of any rumour of the French, for we knew
nothing of that till we met the people on the road, and the colonel said
in a moment the news was false. Buonaparte is not even at Boulogne just
now. I was anxious to know how you had borne the fright, so I hastened
to Overcombe at once, as soon as I could get out of barracks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne, who had not been at all responsive to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) discourse, now swayed
heavily against him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), and looking quickly down he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had
silently fainted. To support her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) arms was of course the impulse
of a moment. There was no water to be had, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could think of nothing
else but to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tenderly till she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) came round again. Certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
desired nothing more.

<p/>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) asked himself, what did it all mean?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) waited, looking down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tired eyelids, and at the row of lashes
lying upon each cheek, whose natural roundness showed itself in singular
perfection now that the customary pink had given place to a pale
luminousness caught from the surrounding atmosphere. The dumpy ringlets
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) forehead and behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) poll, which were usually as tight as
springs, had been partially uncoiled by the wildness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ride, and
hung in split locks over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) forehead and neck. John, who, during the
long months of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) absence, had lived only to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) again, was in a
state of ecstatic reverence, and bending down he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) gently kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/>Anne was just becoming conscious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, Mr. Derriman, never, never!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) murmured, sweeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) was at the bottom of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John.

<p/>Anne opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes, and started back from him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said
wildly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are ill, my dear Miss Garland,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>replied John in trembling anxiety,
and taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not ill, I am wearied out!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Can't we walk on? How far
are we from Overcombe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About a mile. But tell me, somebody has been hurting you--frightening
you. I know who it was; it was Derriman, and that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) horse. Now do
you tell me all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne reflected. <div class="bookquote">``Then if I tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, `will you discuss with
me what I had better do, and not for the present let my mother and your
father know? I don't want to alarm them, and I must not let my affairs
interrupt the business connexion between the mill and the hall that has
gone on for so many years.''

<p/>The trumpet-major promised, and Anne told the adventure. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brow
reddened as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went on, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had done she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Now you are
angry. Don't do anything dreadful, will you? Remember that this Festus
will most likely succeed his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) uncle at Oxwell, in spite of present
appearances, and if Bob succeeds at the mill there should be no enmity
between them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true. I won't tell Bob. Leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) to me. Where is Derriman
now? On his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) way home, I suppose. When I have seen you into the house I
will deal with him (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>)--quite quietly, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) shall say nothing about
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, appeal to him (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>), do! Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) will be better then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked on together, Loveday seeming to experience much quiet bliss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I came to look for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) said, `because of that dear, sweet letter
you wrote.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did write you a letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) admitted, with misgiving, now
beginning to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mistake. <div class="bookquote">``It was because I was sorry I had blamed
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am almost glad you did blame me,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John cheerfully, `since, if you
had not, the letter would not have come. I have read it fifty times a
day.''

<p/>This put Anne into an unhappy mood, and they proceeded without much
further talk till the mill chimneys were visible below them. John then
said that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to go in by herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you are going back to get into some danger on my account?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't get into much danger with such a fellow as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), can I?''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said
John, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) answered, with a sudden carelessness of tone. It was
indispensable that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) should be undeceived, and to begin the process by
taking an affectedly light view of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) personal risks was perhaps as good
a way to do it as any. Where friendliness was construed as love, an
assumed indifference was the necessary expression for friendliness.

<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) go; and, bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hasten back as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could, went
down the hill, while John's feet retraced the upland.

<p/>The trumpet-major spent the whole afternoon and evening in that long and
difficult search for Festus Derriman. Crossing the down at the end of
the second hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) met Molly and Mrs. Loveday. The gig had been
repaired, they had learnt the groundlessness of the alarm, and they would
have been proceeding happily enough but for their anxiety about Anne.
John told them shortly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had got a lift home, and proceeded on his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
way.

<p/>The worthy object of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) search had in the meantime been plodding
homeward on foot, sulky at the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) charger, encumbered with his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
sword, belts, high boots, and uniform, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own discomfiture
careless whether Anne Garland's life had been endangered or not.

<p/>At length Derriman reached a place where the road ran between high banks,
one of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) mounted and paced along as a change from the hard
trackway. Ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) saw an old man sitting down, with eyes fixed
on the dust of the road, as if resting and meditating at one and the same
time. Being pretty sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) recognized his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) uncle in that venerable
figure, Festus came forward stealthily, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) was immediately above the
old man's back. The latter was clothed in faded nankeen breeches,
speckled stockings, a drab hat, and a coat which had once been light
blue, but from exposure as a scarecrow had assumed the complexion and
fibre of a dried pudding-cloth. The farmer was, in fact, returning to
the hall, which he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had left in the morning some time later than his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)
nephew, to seek an asylum in a hollow tree about two miles off. The tree
was so situated as to command a view of the building, and Uncle Benjy had
managed to clamber up inside this natural fortification high enough to
watch his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) residence through a hole in the bark, till, gathering from the
words of occasional passers-by that the alarm was at least premature, he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>)
had ventured into daylight again.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) was now engaged in abstractedly tracing a diagram in the dust with his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>)
walking-stick, and muttered words to himself aloud. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) arose
and went on his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) way without turning round. Festus was curious enough to
descend and look at the marks. They represented an oblong, with two semi-
diagonals, and a little square in the middle. Upon the diagonals were
the figures 20 and 17, and on each side of the parallelogram stood a
letter signifying the point of the compass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What crazy thing is running in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) head now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus to himself,
with supercilious pity, recollecting that the farmer had been singing
those very numbers earlier in the morning. Being able to make nothing of
it, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) lengthened his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) strides, and treading on tiptoe overtook his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)
relative, saluting him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) by scratching his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) back like a hen. The startled
old farmer danced round like a top, and gasping, said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) perceived
his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) nephew, <div class="bookquote">``What, Festy! not thrown from your horse and killed, then,
after all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>nephew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, nunc. What made ye think that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Champion passed me about an hour ago, when I was in hiding--poor timid
soul of me, for I had nothing to lose by the French coming--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Champion</b></font>) looked
awful with the stirrups dangling and the saddle empty. <div class="bookquote">``Tis a gloomy
sight, Festy, to see a horse cantering without a rider, and I thought you
had been--feared you had been thrown off and killed as dead as a nit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless your dear old heart for being so anxious! And what pretty picture
were you drawing just now with your walking-stick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, that! That is only a way I have of amusing myself. It showed how
the French might have advanced to the attack, you know. Such trifles
fill the head of a weak old man like me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or the place where something is hid away--money, for instance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Festy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>said the farmer reproachfully, `you always know I use the old
glove in the bedroom cupboard for any guinea or two I possess.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Festus ironically.

<p/>They had now reached a lonely inn about a mile and a half from the hall,
and, the farmer not responding to his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) nephew's kind invitation to come in
and treat him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>), Festus entered alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) was dusty, draggled, and weary,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) remained at the tavern long. The trumpet-major, in the meantime,
having searched the roads in vain, heard in the course of the evening of
the yeoman's arrival at this place, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) would probably be found
there still. He (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) accordingly approached the door, reaching it just as the
dusk of evening changed to darkness.

<p/>There was no light in the passage, but John pushed on at hazard, inquired
for Derriman, and was told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) would be found in the back parlour
alone. When Loveday first entered the apartment he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) was unable to see
anything, but following the guidance of a vigorous snoring, he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) came to
the settle, upon which Festus lay asleep, his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) position being faintly
signified by the shine of his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) buttons and other parts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) uniform.
John laid his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hand upon the reclining figure and shook him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), and by
degrees Derriman stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) snore and sat up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) said, in the accents of a man who has been drinking
hard. <div class="bookquote">``Is it you, dear Anne? Let me kiss you; yes, I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shut your mouth, you pitiful blockhead; I'll teach you genteeler manners
than to persecute a young woman in that way!''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>and taking Festus by the
ear, he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) gave it a good pull. Festus broke out with an oath, and struck a
vague blow in the air with his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) fist; whereupon the trumpet-major dealt
him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) a box on the right ear, and a similar one on the left to artistically
balance the first. Festus jumped up and used his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) fists wildly, but
without any definite result.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Want to fight, do ye, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John. <div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! you can't fight, you
great baby, and never could. You are only fit to be smacked!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
dealt Festus a specimen of the same on the cheek with the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)
hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, no! O, you are Loveday, the young man she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s going to be
married to, I suppose? Dash me, I didn't want to hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my name is Loveday; and you'll know where to find me, since we
can't finish this to-night. Pistols or swords, whichever you like, my
boy. Take that, and that, so that you may not forget to call upon me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) smacked the yeoman's ears and cheeks. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know what it
is for, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Mr. Loveday, sir--yes, I mean, I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it for, then? I shall keep smacking until you tell me. Gad! if
you weren't drunk, I'd half kill you here to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is because I served her (<font color='blue'><b>Pistols</b></font>) badly. Damned if I care! I'll do it again,
and be hanged to `ee! Where's my horse Champion? Tell me that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)
hit at the trumpet-major.

<p/>John parried this attack, and taking him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) firmly by the collar, pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
down into the seat, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Here I hold `ee till you beg pardon for your
doings to-day. Do you want any more of it, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) shook the
yeoman to a sort of jelly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do beg pardon--no, I don't. I say this, that you shall not take such
liberties with old Squire Derriman's nephew, you dirty miller's son, you
flour-worm, you smut in the corn! I'll call you out to-morrow morning,
and have my revenge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you will; that's what I came for.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And pushing him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) back into
the corner of the settle, Loveday went out of the house, feeling
considerable satisfaction at having got himself into the beginning of as
nice a quarrel about Anne Garland as the most jealous lover could desire.

<p/>But of one feature in this curious adventure he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had not the least
notion--that Festus Derriman, misled by the darkness, the fumes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>)
potations, and the constant sight of Anne and Bob together, never once
supposed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) assailant to be any other man than Bob, believing the
trumpet-major miles away.

<p/>There was a moon during the early part of John's walk home, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
had arrived within a mile of Overcombe the sky clouded over, and rain
suddenly began to fall with some violence. Near him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was a wooden granary
on tall stone staddles, and perceiving that the rain was only a
thunderstorm which would soon pass away, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) ascended the steps and
entered the doorway, where he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) stood watching the half-obscured moon
through the streaming rain. Presently, to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) surprise, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) beheld a
female figure running forward with great rapidity, not towards the
granary for shelter, but towards open ground. What could she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) be running
for in that direction? The answer came in the appearance of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) brother
Bob from that quarter, seated on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father's heavy horse. As
soon as the woman met him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), Bob dismounted and caught her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) arms.
They stood locked together, the rain beating into their unconscious
forms, and the horse looking on.

<p/>The trumpet-major fell back inside the granary, and threw himself on a
heap of empty sacks which lay in the corner: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had recognized the woman
to be Anne. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) reclined in a stupor till he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was aroused by the
sound of voices under him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), the voices of Anne and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) brother, who,
having at last discovered that they were getting wet, had taken shelter
under the granary floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been home,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Mother and Molly have both got back long
ago. We were all anxious about you, and I came out to look for you. O,
Bob, I am so glad to see you again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div><p/>John might have heard every word of the conversation, which was continued
in the same strain for a long time; but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) ears, and would
not. Still they remained, and still was he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) determined that they should
not see him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). With the conserved hope of more than half a year dashed
away in a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could yet feel that the cruelty of a protest would
be even greater than its inutility. It was absolutely by his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own
contrivance that the situation had been shaped. Bob, left to himself,
would long ere this have been the husband of another woman.

<p/>The rain decreased, and the lovers went on. John looked after them as
they strolled, aqua-tinted by the weak moon and mist. Bob had thrust one
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) arms through the rein of the horse, and the other was round Anne's
waist. When they were lost behind the declivity the trumpet-major came
out, and walked homeward even more slowly than they. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) went on, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
face put off its complexion of despair for one of serene resolve. For
the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) dealings with friends he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) entered upon a course of
counterfeiting, set his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) features to conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) thought, and instructed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) tongue to do likewise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) threw fictitiousness into his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) very gait,
even now, when there was nobody to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), and struck at stems of wild
parsley with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) regimental switch as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had used to do when soldiering
was new to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), and life in general a charming experience.

<p/>Thus cloaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) sickly thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) descended to the mill as the others
had done before him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), occasionally looking down upon the wet road to
notice how close Anne's little tracks were to Bob's all the way along,
and how precisely a curve in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) course was followed by a curve in hers.
But after this he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) erected his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) head and walked so smartly up to the front
door that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) spurs rang through the court.

<p/>They had all reached home, but before any of them could speak he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) cried
gaily, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, Bob, I have been thinking of you! By God, how are you, my
boy? No French cut-throats after all, you see. Here we are, well and
happy together again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A good Providence has watched over us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Loveday cheerfully.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, in all times and places we are in God's hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So we be, so we be!''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller, who still shone in all the
fierceness of uniform. <div class="bookquote">``Well, now we'll ha'e a drop o' drink.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's none,''  (<font color='red'><b>David</b></font>)</div>said David, coming forward with a drawn face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Afore I went to church for a pike to defend my native country from
Boney, I pulled out the spigots of all the barrels, maister; for, thinks
I--damn him (<font color='blue'><b>Boney</b></font>)!--since we can't drink it ourselves, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boney</b></font>) shan't have it, nor
none of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boney</b></font>) men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you shouldn't have done it till you was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Boney</b></font>)'d come!''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the
miller, aghast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Chok' it all, I was sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>David</b></font>)</div>said David. <div class="bookquote">``I'd sooner see churches fall
than good drink wasted; but how was I to know better?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well; what with one thing and another this day will cost me a
pretty penny!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Loveday, bustling off to the cellar, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) found
to be several inches deep in stagnant liquor. ``John, how can I welcome
``ee?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) continued hopelessly, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) return to the room. <div class="bookquote">``Only go and
see what he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'s done!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've ladled up a drap wi' a spoon, trumpet-major,''  (<font color='red'><b>David</b></font>)</div>said David. <div class="bookquote">''`Tisn't
bad drinking, though it do taste a little of the floor, that's true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>David</b></font>)</div><p/>John said that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did not require anything at all; and then they all sat
down to supper, and were very temperately gay with a drop of mild elder-
wine which Mrs. Loveday found in the bottom of a jar. The trumpet-major,
adhering to the part he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) meant to play, gave humorous accounts of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
adventures since he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had last sat there. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) told them that the season was
to be a very lively one--that the royal family was coming, as usual, and
many other interesting things; so that when he (<font color='blue'><b>royal</b></font>) left them to return to
barracks few would have supposed the British army to contain a lighter-
hearted man.

<p/>Anne was the only one who doubted the reality of this behaviour. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had gone up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) bedroom she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) stood for some time looking at the
wick of the candle as if it were a painful object, the expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
face being shaped by the conviction that John's afternoon words when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) out of the way of Champion were not in accordance with his (<font color='blue'><b>Champion</b></font>)
words to-night, and that the dimly-realized kiss during her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) faintness was
no imaginary one. But in the blissful circumstances of having Bob at
hand again she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) took optimist views, and persuaded herself that John would
soon begin to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in the light of a sister.




<p/>XXIX. A DISSEMBLER


<p/>To cursory view, John Loveday seemed to accomplish this with amazing
ease. Whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) came from barracks to Overcombe, which was once or
twice a week, he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) related news of all sorts to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) and Bob with infinite
zest, and made the time as happy a one as had ever been known at the
mill, save for himself alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said nothing of Festus, except so far
as to inform Anne that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had expected to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) and been disappointed.
On the evening after the King's arrival at his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) seaside residence John
appeared again, staying to supper and describing the royal entry, the
many tasteful illuminations and transparencies which had been exhibited,
the quantities of tallow candles burnt for that purpose, and the swarms
of aristocracy who had followed the King thither.

<p/>When supper was over Bob went outside the house to shut the shutters,
which had, as was often the case, been left open some time after lights
were kindled within. John still sat at the table when his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) brother
approached the window, though the others had risen and retired. Bob was
struck by seeing through the pane how John's face had changed. Throughout
the supper-time he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had been talking to Anne in the gay tone habitual with
him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) now, which gave greater strangeness to the gloom of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) present
appearance. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) remained in thought for a moment, took a letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
breast-pocket, opened it, and, with a tender smile at his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) weakness,
kissed the writing before restoring it to its place. The letter was one
that Anne had written to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) at Exonbury.

<p/>Bob stood perplexed; and then a suspicion crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) mind that John,
from brotherly goodness, might be feigning a satisfaction with recent
events which he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did not feel. Bob now made a noise with the shutters, at
which the trumpet-major rose and went out, Bob at once following him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jack,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sailor</b></font>)</div>said the sailor ingenuously, <div class="bookquote">``I'm terribly sorry that I've done
wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the sailor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) brother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In courting our little Anne. Well, you see, John, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was in the same
house with me, and somehow or other I made myself her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) beau. But I have
been thinking that perhaps you had the first claim on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and if so,
Jack, I'll make way for `ee. I--I don't care for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) much, you know--not
so very much, and can give her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) up very well. It is nothing serious
between us at all. Yes, John, you try to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>); I can look elsewhere.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>Bob never knew how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) loved Anne till he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) found himself making this
speech of renunciation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O Bob, you are mistaken!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the trumpet-major, who was not deceived.
<div class="bookquote">``When I first saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) I admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and I admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) now, and like her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).
I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) so well that I shall be glad to see you marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>replied Bob, with hesitation, <div class="bookquote">``I thought I saw you looking very
sad, as if you were in love; I saw you take out a letter, in short.
That's what it was disturbed me and made me come to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, I see your mistake!''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John, laughing forcedly.

<p/>At this minute Mrs. Loveday and the miller, who were taking a twilight
walk in the garden, strolled round near to where the brothers stood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
talked volubly on events in Budmouth, as most people did at this time.
<div class="bookquote">``And they tell me that the theatre has been painted up afresh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) was
saying, `and that the actors have come for the season, with the most
lovely actresses that ever were seen.''

<p/>When they had passed by John continued, <div class="bookquote">``I _am_ in love, Bob; but--not
with Anne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! who is it then?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mate</b></font>)</div>said the mate hopefully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One of the actresses at the theatre,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>John replied, with a concoctive
look at the vanishing forms of Mr. and Mrs. Loveday. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) is a very
lovely woman, you know. But we won't say anything more about it--it
dashes a man so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, one of the actresses!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob, with open mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But don't you say anything about it!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued the trumpet-major
heartily. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want it known.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no--I won't, of course. May I not know her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No, not now, Bob. I cannot tell <div class="bookquote">``ee,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>John answered, and with truth,
for Loveday did not know the name of any actress in the world.

<p/>When his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) brother had gone, Captain Bob hastened off in a state of great
animation to Anne, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) found on the top of a neighbouring hillock
which the daylight had scarcely as yet deserted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been a long time coming, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), in sprightly tones of
reproach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dearest; and you'll be glad to hear why. I've found out the whole
mystery--yes--why he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s queer, and everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne looked startled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s up to the gunnel in love! We must try to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) on in it, or I
fear he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'ll go melancholy-mad like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We help him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) asked faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) heart to one of the play-actresses at Budmouth, and I
think she (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) slights him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, I am so glad!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Glad that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) venture don't prosper?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no; glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s so sensible. How long is it since that alarm of the
French?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Six weeks, honey. Why do you ask?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Men can forget in six weeks, can't they, Bob?''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div><p/>The impression that John had really kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) still remained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, some men might,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>observed Bob judicially. '_I_ couldn't. Perhaps
John might. I couldn't forget _you_ in twenty times as long. Do you
know, Anne, I half thought it was you John cared about; and it was a
weight off my heart when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) didn<div class="bookquote">``t.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) say he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) didn<div class="bookquote">``t?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) assured me himself that the only person in the hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
heart was this lovely play-actress, and nobody else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How I should like to see her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. So should I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather it had been one of our own neighbours' girls, whose birth
and breeding we know of; but still, if that is his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) taste, I hope it will
end well for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>). How very quick he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) has been! I certainly wish we could
see her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know so much as her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) name. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) is very close, and wouldn't tell a
thing about her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Couldn't we get him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) to go to the theatre with us? and then we could
watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), and easily find out the right one. Then we would learn if she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
is a good young woman; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) is, could we not ask her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) here, and so
make it smoother for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) has been very gay lately; that means
budding love: and sometimes between his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) gaieties he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) has had melancholy
moments; that means there's difficulty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) plan a good one, and resolved to put it in practice on
the first available evening. Anne was very curious as to whether John
did really cherish a new passion, the story having quite surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).
Possibly it was true; six weeks had passed since John had shown a single
symptom of the old attachment, and what could not that space of time
effect in the heart of a soldier whose very profession it was to leave
girls behind him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)?

<p/>After this John Loveday did not come to see them for nearly a month, a
neglect which was set down by Bob as an additional proof that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
brother's affections were no longer exclusively centred in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) old home.
When at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) did arrive, and the theatre-going was mentioned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>),
the flush of consciousness which Anne expected to see upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) face was
unaccountably absent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Bob; I should very well like to go to the theatre,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) replied
heartily. <div class="bookquote">``Who is going besides?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>Bob told him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), and then it seemed to occur to the trumpet-
major that something had been expected of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) rose and said
privately to Bob with some confusion, <div class="bookquote">``O yes, of course we'll go. As I
am connected with one of the--in short I can get you in for nothing, you
know. At least let me manage everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes. I wonder you didn't propose to take us before, Jack, and let
us have a good look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought to have. You shall go on a King's night. You won't want me to
point her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) out, Bob; I have my reasons at present for asking it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll be content with guessing,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) brother.

<p/>When the gallant John was gone, Anne observed, <div class="bookquote">``Bob, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) is changed! I
watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) showed no feeling, even when you burst upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) suddenly
with the subject nearest his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be because his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) suit don't fay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain Bob.




<p/>XXX. AT THE THEATRE ROYAL


<p/>In two or three days a message arrived asking them to attend at the
theatre on the coming evening, with the added request that they would
dress in their gayest clothes, to do justice to the places taken.
Accordingly, in the course of the afternoon they drove off, Bob having
clothed himself in a splendid suit, recently purchased as an attempt to
bring himself nearer to Anne's style when they appeared in public
together. As finished off by this dashing and really fashionable attire,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was the perfection of a beau in the dog-days; pantaloons and boots of
the newest make; yards and yards of muslin wound round his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) neck, forming
a sort of asylum for the lower part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) face; two fancy waistcoats,
and coat-buttons like circular shaving glasses. The absurd extreme of
female fashion, which was to wear muslin dresses in January, was at this
time equalled by that of the men, who wore clothes enough in August to
melt them. Nobody would have guessed from Bob's presentation now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
had ever been aloft on a dark night in the Atlantic, or knew the hundred
ingenuities that could be performed with a rope's end and a marline-spike
as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) mother tongue.

<p/>It was a day of days. Anne wore her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) celebrated celestial blue pelisse,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) Leghorn hat, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) muslin dress with the waist under the arms; the
latter being decorated with excellent Honiton lace bought of the woman
who travelled from that place to Overcombe and its neighbourhood with a
basketful of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own manufacture, and a cushion on which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) worked by
the wayside. John met the lovers at the inn outside the town, and after
stabling the horse they entered the town together, the trumpet-major
informing them that the watering-place had never been so full before,
that the Court, the Prince of Wales, and everybody of consequence was
there, and that an attic could scarcely be got for money. The King had
gone for a cruise in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) yacht, and they would be in time to see him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
land.

<p/>Then drums and fifes were heard, and in a minute or two they saw Sergeant
Stanner advancing along the street with a firm countenance, fiery poll,
and rigid staring eyes, in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stanner</b></font>) recruiting-party. The sergeant's
sword was drawn, and at intervals of two or three inches along its
shining blade were impaled fluttering one-pound notes, to express the
lavish bounty that was offered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stanner</b></font>) gave a stern, suppressed nod of
friendship to our people, and passed by. Next they came up to a waggon,
bowered over with leaves and flowers, so that the men inside could hardly
be seen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come to see the King, hip-hip hurrah!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried a voice within, and turning
they saw through the leaves the nose and face of Cripplestraw. The
waggon contained all Derriman's workpeople.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is your master here?''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, trumpet-major, sir. But young maister is coming to fetch us at nine
o'clock, in case we should be too blind to drive home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O! where is he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne impatiently, at which the trumpet-major
obediently moved on.

<p/>By the time they reached the pier it was six o'clock; the royal yacht was
returning; a fact announced by the ships in the harbour firing a salute.
The King came ashore with his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hand, and returned the
salutations of the well-dressed crowd in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) old indiscriminate fashion.
While this cheering and waving of handkerchiefs was going on Anne stood
between the two brothers, who protectingly joined their hands behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
back, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) were a delicate piece of statuary that a push might
damage. Soon the King had passed, and receiving the military salutes of
the piquet, joined the Queen and princesses at Gloucester Lodge, the
homely house of red brick in which he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) unostentatiously resided.

<p/>As there was yet some little time before the theatre would open, they
strayed upon the velvet sands, and listened to the songs of the sailors,
one of whom extemporized for the occasion:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Portland Road the King aboard, the King aboard!
Portland Road the King aboard,
We weighed and sailed from Portland Road!''  (<font color='red'><b>the sailors</b></font>)</div>-LCB-272-RCB-

<p/>When they had looked on awhile at the combats at single-stick which were
in progress hard by, and seen the sum of five guineas handed over to the
modest gentleman who had broken most heads, they returned to Gloucester
Lodge, whence the King and other members of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) family now reappeared,
and drove, at a slow trot, round to the theatre in carriages drawn by the
Hanoverian white horses that were so well known in the town at this date.

<p/>When Anne and Bob entered the theatre they found that John had taken
excellent places, and concluded that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had got them for nothing through
the influence of the lady of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) choice. As a matter of fact he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had paid
full prices for those two seats, like any other outsider, and even then
had a difficulty in getting them, it being a King's night. When they
were settled he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) himself retired to an obscure part of the pit, from which
the stage was scarcely visible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can see beautifully,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob, in an aristocratic voice, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) took
a delicate pinch of snuff, and drew out the magnificent
pocket-handkerchief brought home from the East for such occasions. <div class="bookquote">``But
I am afraid poor John can't see at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we can see him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>replied Anne, `and notice by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) face which of them
it is he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) is so charmed with. The light of that corner candle falls right
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) cheek.''

<p/>By this time the King had appeared in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) place, which was overhung by a
canopy of crimson satin fringed with gold. About twenty places were
occupied by the royal family and suite; and beyond them was a crowd of
powdered and glittering personages of fashion, completely filling the
centre of the little building; though the King so frequently patronized
the local stage during these years that the crush was not inconvenient.

<p/>The curtain rose and the play began. To-night it was one of Colman's,
who at this time enjoyed great popularity, and Mr. Bannister supported
the leading character. Anne, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand privately clasped in Bob's,
and looking as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not know it, partly watched the piece and
partly the face of the impressionable John who had so soon transferred
his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) affections elsewhere. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had not long to wait. When a certain one
of the subordinate ladies of the comedy entered on the stage the trumpet-
major in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) corner not only looked conscious, but started and gazed with
parted lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This must be the one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>whispered Anne quickly. <div class="bookquote">``See, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is agitated!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) turned to Bob, but at the same moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) hand convulsively closed
upon hers as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), too, strangely fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) eyes upon the newly-entered
lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne looked from one to the other without regarding the stage at all. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
answer came in the voice of the actress who now spoke for the first time.
The accents were those of Miss Matilda Johnson.

<p/>One thought rushed into both their minds on the instant, and Bob was the
first to utter it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What--is she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) the woman of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) choice after all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If so, it is a dreadful thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>murmured Anne.

<p/>But, as may be imagined, the unfortunate John was as much surprised by
this rencounter as the other two. Until this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had been in utter
ignorance of the theatrical company and all that pertained to it.
Moreover, much as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) knew of Miss Johnson, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was not aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) had
ever been trained in her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) youth as an actress, and that after lapsing into
straits and difficulties for a couple of years she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) had been so fortunate
as to again procure an engagement here.

<p/>The trumpet-major, though not prominently seated, had been seen by
Matilda already, who had observed still more plainly her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) old betrothed
and Anne in the other part of the house. John was not concerned on his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
own account at being face to face with her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>), but at the extraordinary
suspicion that this conjuncture must revive in the minds of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) best
beloved friends. After some moments of pained reflection he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) tapped his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
knee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gad, I won't explain; it shall go as it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Let them think
her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mine. Better that than the truth, after all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the audience regal</b></font>)</div><p/>Had personal prominence in the scene been at this moment proportioned to
intentness of feeling, the whole audience, regal and otherwise, would
have faded into an indistinct mist of background, leaving as the sole
emergent and telling figures Bob and Anne at one point, the trumpet-major
on the left hand, and Matilda at the opposite corner of the stage. But
fortunately the deadlock of awkward suspense into which all four had
fallen was terminated by an accident. A messenger entered the King's box
with despatches. There was an instant pause in the performance. The
despatch-box being opened the King read for a few moments with great
interest, the eyes of the whole house, including those of Anne Garland,
being anxiously fixed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) face; for terrible events fell as
unexpectedly as thunderbolts at this critical time of our history. The
King at length beckoned to Lord --, who was immediately behind him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), the
play was again stopped, and the contents of the despatch were publicly
communicated to the audience.

<p/>Sir Robert Calder, cruising off Finisterre, had come in sight of
Villeneuve, and made the signal for action, which, though checked by the
weather, had resulted in the capture of two Spanish line-of-battle ships,
and the retreat of Villeneuve into Ferrol.

<p/>The news was received with truly national feeling, if noise might be
taken as an index of patriotism. ``Rule Britannia' was called for and
sung by the whole house. But the importance of the event was far from
being recognized at this time; and Bob Loveday, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) sat there and heard
it, had very little conception how it would bear upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) destiny.

<p/>This parenthetic excitement diverted for a few minutes the eyes of Bob
and Anne from the trumpet-major; and when the play proceeded, and they
looked back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) corner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s just slipped round to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) behind the scenes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob
knowingly. <div class="bookquote">``Shall we go too, and tease him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) for a sly dog?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I would rather not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we go home, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not unless her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) presence is too much for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O--not at all. We'll stay here. Ah, there she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) is again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Matilda/Miss Johnson/Matilda Johnson</b></font>)</div><p/>They sat on, and listened to Matilda's speeches which she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) delivered with
such delightful coolness that they soon began to considerably interest
one of the party.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what a nerve the young woman has!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said at last in tones of
admiration, and gazing at Miss Johnson with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) might. <div class="bookquote">``After all,
Jack's taste is not so bad. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s really deuced clever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bob, I'll go home if you wish to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O no--let us see how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fleets herself off that bit of a scrape she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s
playing at now. Well, what a hand she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is at it, to be sure!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne said no more, but waited on, supremely uncomfortable, and almost
tearful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) began to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not like life particularly well;
it was too complicated: she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw nothing of the scene, and only longed to
get away, and to get Bob away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). At last the curtain fell on the
final act, and then began the farce of <div class="bookquote">``No Song no Supper.''  (<font color='red'><b>Matilda/Miss Johnson/Matilda Johnson</b></font>)</div>Matilda did
not appear in this piece, and Anne again inquired if they should go home.
This time Bob agreed, and taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) under his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) care with redoubled
affection, to make up for the species of coma which had seized upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
heart for a time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) quietly accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) out of the house.

<p/>When they emerged upon the esplanade, the August moon was shining across
the sea from the direction of St. Aldhelm's Head. Bob unconsciously
loitered, and turned towards the pier. Reaching the end of the promenade
they surveyed the quivering waters in silence for some time, until a long
dark line shot from behind the promontory of the Nothe, and swept forward
into the harbour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What boat is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to be some frigate lying in the Roads,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob carelessly, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) brought Anne round with a gentle pressure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) arm and bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
steps towards the homeward end of the town.

<p/>Meanwhile, Miss Johnson, having finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) duties for that evening,
rapidly changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) dress, and went out likewise. The prominent position
which Anne and Captain Bob had occupied side by side in the theatre, left
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) no alternative but to suppose that the situation was arranged by Bob
as a species of defiance to herself; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heart, such as it was,
became proportionately embittered against him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>). In spite of the rise in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) fortunes, Miss Johnson still remembered--and always would
remember--her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) humiliating departure from Overcombe; and it had been to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) even a more grievous thing that Bob had acquiesced in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) brother's
ruling than that John had determined it. At the time of setting out she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>)
was sustained by a firm faith that Bob would follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>), and nullify his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
brother's scheme; but though she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) waited Bob never came.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) passed along by the houses facing the sea, and scanned the shore, the
footway, and the open road close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>), which, illuminated by the
slanting moon to a great brightness, sparkled with minute facets of
crystallized salts from the water sprinkled there during the day. The
promenaders at the further edge appeared in dark profiles; and beyond
them was the grey sea, parted into two masses by the tapering braid of
moonlight across the waves.

<p/>Two forms crossed this line at a startling nearness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) marked
them at once as Anne and Bob Loveday. They were walking slowly, and in
the earnestness of their discourse were oblivious of the presence of any
human beings save themselves. Matilda stood motionless till they had
passed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How I love them!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) said, treading the initial step of her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) walk
onwards with a vehemence that walking did not demand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I--especially one,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>said a voice at her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) elbow; and a man wheeled
round her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>), and looked in her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) face, which had been fully exposed to the
moon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You--who are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you remember, ma'am? We walked some way together towards
Overcombe earlier in the summer.''  (<font color='red'><b>Matilda/Miss Johnson/Matilda Johnson</b></font>)</div>Matilda looked more closely, and
perceived that the speaker was Derriman, in plain clothes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) continued,
<div class="bookquote">``You are one of the ladies of the theatre, I know. May I ask why you
said in such a queer way that you loved that couple?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a queer way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, as if you hated them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind your knowing that I have good reason to hate them. You do
too, it seems?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus savagely, `came to me one night about that very
woman; insulted me before I could put myself on my guard, and ran away
before I could come up with him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) and avenge myself. The woman tricks me
at every turn! I want to part <div class="bookquote">``em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why don't you? There's a splendid opportunity. Do you see that
soldier walking along? He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)'s a marine; he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) looks into the gallery of the
theatre every night: and he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)'s in connexion with the press-gang that came
ashore just now from the frigate lying in Portland Roads. They are often
here for men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes. Our boatmen dread <div class="bookquote">``em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we have only to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) that Loveday is a seaman to be clear of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) this very night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Done!''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus. <div class="bookquote">``Take my arm and come this way.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They walked
across to the footway. <div class="bookquote">``Fine night, sergeant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Looking for hands, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not to be known, sir. We don't begin till half past ten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a pity you don't begin now. I could show `ee excellent game.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``What, that little nest of fellows at the ``Old Rooms'' in Cove Row? I
have just heard of <div class="bookquote">``em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--come here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>Festus, with Miss Johnson on his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) arm, led the sergeant
quickly along the parade, and by the time they reached the Narrows the
lovers, who walked but slowly, were visible in front of them. <div class="bookquote">``There's
your man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That buck in pantaloons and half-boots--a looking like a squire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Twelve months ago he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) was mate of the brig Pewit; but his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) father has made
money, and keeps him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Faith, now you tell of it, there's a hint of sea legs about him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>). What's
the young beau's name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't tell!''  (<font color='red'><b>Matilda/Miss Johnson/Matilda Johnson</b></font>)</div>whispered Matilda, impulsively clutching Festus's arm.

<p/>But Festus had already said, <div class="bookquote">``Robert Loveday, son of the miller at
Overcombe. You may find several likely fellows in that neighbourhood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div><p/>The marine said that he (<font color='blue'><b>marine</b></font>) would bear it in mind, and they left him (<font color='blue'><b>marine</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you had not told,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matilda/Miss Johnson/Matilda Johnson</b></font>)</div>said Matilda tearfully. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>beau</b></font>)'s the worst!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dash my eyes now; listen to that! Why, you chicken-hearted old stager,
you was as well agreed as I. Come now; hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) used you badly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Matilda/Miss Johnson/Matilda Johnson</b></font>)</div><p/>Matilda's acrimony returned. <div class="bookquote">``I was down on my luck, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) wouldn't have
had the chance!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, let things be.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>XXXI. MIDNIGHT VISITORS


<p/>Miss Garland and Loveday walked leisurely to the inn and called for horse-
and-gig. While the hostler was bringing it round, the landlord, who knew
Bob and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) family well, spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) quietly in the passage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this then because you want to throw dust in the eyes of the Black
Diamond chaps?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>-LRB-with an admiring glance at Bob's costume-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Black Diamond?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob; and Anne turned pale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>beau</b></font>) hove in sight just after dark, and at nine o'clock a boat having
more than a dozen marines on board, with cloaks on, rowed into harbour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob reflected. <div class="bookquote">``Then there'll be a press to-night; depend upon it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They won't know you, will they, Bob?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They certainly won't know him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) for a seaman now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>remarked the landlord,
laughing, and again surveying Bob up and down. <div class="bookquote">``But if I was you two, I
should drive home-along straight and quiet; and be very busy in the mill
all to-morrow, Mr. Loveday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They drove away; and when they had got onward out of the town, Anne
strained her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes wistfully towards Portland. Its dark contour, lying
like a whale on the sea, was just perceptible in the gloom as the
background to half-a-dozen ships' lights nearer at hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They can't make you go, now you are a gentleman tradesman, can they?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If they want me they can have me, dearest. I have often said I ought to
volunteer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And not care about me at all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is just that that keeps me at home. I won't leave you if I can help
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It cannot make such a vast difference to the country whether one man
goes or stays! But if you want to go you had better, and not mind us at
all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob put a period to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) speech by a mark of affection to which history
affords many parallels in every age. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said no more about the Black
Diamond; but whenever they ascended a hill she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head to look at
the lights in Portland Roads, and the grey expanse of intervening sea.

<p/>Though Captain Bob had stated that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) did not wish to volunteer, and
would not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) could help it, the remark required some
qualification. That Anne was charming and loving enough to chain him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
anywhere was true; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had begun to find the mill-work terribly
irksome at times. Often during the last month, when standing among the
rumbling cogs in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) new miller's suit, which ill became him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had
yawned, thought wistfully of the old pea-jacket, and the waters of the
deep blue sea. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) dread of displeasing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father by showing anything
of this change of sentiment was great; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) might have braved it but
for knowing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) marriage with Anne, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) hoped might take place
the next year, was dependent entirely upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) adherence to the mill
business. Even were his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father indifferent, Mrs. Loveday would never
intrust her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) only daughter to the hands of a husband who would be away
from home five-sixths of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) time.

<p/>But though, apart from Anne, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was not averse to seafaring in itself, to
be smuggled thither by the machinery of a press-gang was intolerable; and
the process of seizing, stunning, pinioning, and carrying off unwilling
hands was one which Bob as a man had always determined to hold out
against to the utmost of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) power. Hence, as they went towards home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
frequently listened for sounds behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), but hearing none he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) assured
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) sweetheart that they were safe for that night at least. The mill was
still going when they arrived, though old Mr. Loveday was not to be seen;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had retired as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) heard the horse's hoofs in the lane, leaving
Bob to watch the grinding till three o'clock; when the elder would rise,
and Bob withdraw to bed--a frequent arrangement between them since Bob
had taken the place of grinder.

<p/>Having reached the privacy of her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) own room, Anne threw open the window,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had not the slightest intention of going to bed just yet. The
tale of the Black Diamond had disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) by a slow, insidious process
that was worse than sudden fright. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) window looked into the court
before the house, now wrapped in the shadow of the trees and the hill;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) leaned upon its sill listening intently. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could have heard
any strange sound distinctly enough in one direction; but in the other
all low noises were absorbed in the patter of the mill, and the rush of
water down the race.

<p/>However, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heard came from the hitherto silent side, and was
intelligible in a moment as being the footsteps of men. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tried to
think they were some late stragglers from Budmouth. Alas! no; the tramp
was too regular for that of villagers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hastily turned, extinguished
the candle, and listened again. As they were on the main road there was,
after all, every probability that the party would pass the bridge which
gave access to the mill court without turning in upon it, or even
noticing that such an entrance existed. In this again she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was
disappointed: they crossed into the front without a pause. The
pulsations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heart became a turmoil now, for why should these men,
if they were the press-gang, and strangers to the locality, have supposed
that a sailor was to be found here, the younger of the two millers
Loveday being never seen now in any garb which could suggest that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) was
other than a miller pure, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) father? One of the men spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not sure that we are in the right place,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a mill, anyhow,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's lots about here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then come this way a moment with your light.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div><p/>Two of the group went towards the cart-house on the opposite side of the
yard, and when they reached it a dark lantern was opened, the rays being
directed upon the front of the miller's waggon.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Loveday and Son, Overcombe Mill,'' (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>' continued the man, reading from the
waggon. '<div class="bookquote">``Son,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>you see, is lately painted in. That's our man.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moved to turn off the light, but before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done so it flashed over
the forms of the speakers, and revealed a sergeant, a naval officer, and
a file of marines.

<p/>Anne waited to see no more. When Bob stayed up to grind, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was doing
to-night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) often sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) room instead of remaining all the time in
the mill; and this room was an isolated chamber over the bakehouse, which
could not be reached without going downstairs and ascending the
step-ladder that served for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) staircase. Anne descended in the dark,
clambered up the ladder, and saw that light strayed through the chink
below the door. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) window faced towards the garden, and hence the light
could not as yet have been seen by the press-gang.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bob, dear Bob!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, through the keyhole. <div class="bookquote">``Put out your light, and
run out of the back-door!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob, leisurely knocking the ashes from the pipe he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had been
smoking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The press-gang!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They have come? By God! who can have blown upon me? All right,
dearest. I'm game.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne, scarcely knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did, descended the ladder and ran to the
back-door, hastily unbolting it to save Bob's time, and gently opening it
in readiness for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had no sooner done this than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt hands
laid upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) shoulder from without, and a voice exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``That's how
we doos it--quite an obleeging young man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Though the hands held her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) rather roughly, Anne did not mind for herself,
and turning she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) cried desperately, in tones intended to reach Bob's ears:
<div class="bookquote">``They are at the back-door; try the front!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>But inexperienced Miss Garland little knew the shrewd habits of the
gentlemen she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) had to deal with, who, well used to this sort of pastime,
had already posted themselves at every outlet from the premises.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring the lantern,''  (<font color='red'><b>the fellow</b></font>)</div>shouted the fellow who held her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Why--`tis a girl!
I half thought so--Here is a way in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) continued to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) comrades,
hastening to the foot of the ladder which led to Bob's room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What d'ye want?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob, quietly opening the door, and showing himself
still radiant in the full dress that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had worn with such effect at the
Theatre Royal, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had been about to change for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) mill suit when
Anne gave the alarm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This gentleman can't be the right one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>observed a marine, rather
impressed by Bob's appearance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes; that's the man,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the sergeant. <div class="bookquote">``Now take it quietly, my
young cock-o'-wax. You look as if you meant to, and `tis wise of ye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going to take me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only aboard the Black Diamond. If you choose to take the bounty and
come voluntarily, you'll be allowed to go ashore whenever your ship's in
port. If you don't, and we've got to pinion ye, you will not have your
liberty at all. As you must come, willy-nilly, you'll do the first if
you've any brains whatever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob's temper began to rise. ``Don't you talk so large, about your
pinioning, my man. When I've settled--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now or never, young blow-hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>informant</b></font>)</div>interrupted his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) informant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, what jabber is this going on?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lieutenant</b></font>)</div>said the lieutenant, stepping
forward. <div class="bookquote">``Bring your man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the marines foot</b></font>)</div><p/>One of the marines set foot on the ladder, but at the same moment a shoe
from Bob's hand hit the lantern with well-aimed directness, knocking it
clean out of the grasp of the man who held it. In spite of the darkness
they began to scramble up the ladder. Bob thereupon shut the door, which
being but of slight construction, was as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) knew only a momentary
defence. But it gained him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) time enough to open the window, gather up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
legs upon the sill, and spring across into the apple-tree growing
without. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) alighted without much hurt beyond a few scratches from the
boughs, a shower of falling apples testifying to the force of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) leap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>shouted several below who had seen Bob's figure flying like
a raven's across the sky.

<p/>There was stillness for a moment in the tree. Then the fugitive made
haste to climb out upon a low-hanging branch towards the garden, at which
the men beneath all rushed in that direction to catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) dropped,
saying, ``You may as well come down, old boy. ``Twas a spry jump, and we
give ye credit for <div class="bookquote">``t.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>The latter movement of Loveday had been a mere feint. Partly hidden by
the leaves he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) glided back to the other part of the tree, from whence it
was easy to jump upon a thatch-covered out-house. This intention they
did not appear to suspect, which gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) the opportunity of sliding down
the slope and entering the back door of the mill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s here, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s here!''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>the men exclaimed, running back from the tree.

<p/>By this time they had obtained another light, and pursued him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) closely
along the back quarters of the mill. Bob had entered the lower room,
seized hold of the chain by which the flour-sacks were hoisted from story
to story by connexion with the mill-wheel, and pulled the rope that hung
alongside for the purpose of throwing it into gear. The foremost
pursuers arrived just in time to see Captain Bob's legs and shoe-buckles
vanishing through the trap-door in the joists overhead, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) person having
been whirled up by the machinery like any bag of flour, and the trap
falling to behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s gone up by the hoist!''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the sergeant, running up the ladder in
the corner to the next floor, and elevating the light just in time to see
Bob's suspended figure ascending in the same way through the same sort of
trap into the second floor. The second trap also fell together behind
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was lost to view as before.

<p/>It was more difficult to follow now; there was only a flimsy little
ladder, and the men ascended cautiously. When they stepped out upon the
loft it was empty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) must ha' let go here,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marines</b></font>)</div>said one of the marines, who knew more about
mills than the others. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had held fast a moment longer, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would
have been dashed against that beam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They looked up. The hook by which Bob had held on had ascended to the
roof, and was winding round the cylinder. Nothing was visible elsewhere
but boarded divisions like the stalls of a stable, on each side of the
stage they stood upon, these compartments being more or less heaped up
with wheat and barley in the grain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s buried himself in the corn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The crew</b></font>)</div><p/>The whole crew jumped into the corn-bins, and stirred about their yellow
contents; but neither arm, leg, nor coat-tail was uncovered. They
removed sacks, peeped among the rafters of the roof, but to no purpose.
The lieutenant began to fume at the loss of time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What cursed fools to let the man go! Why, look here, what's this?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>)
had opened the door by which sacks were taken in from waggons without,
and dangling from the cat-head projecting above it was the rope used in
lifting them. <div class="bookquote">``There's the way he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went down,''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>the officer continued.
<div class="bookquote">``The man's gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gang</b></font>)</div><p/>Amidst mumblings and curses the gang descended the pair of ladders and
came into the open air; but Captain Bob was nowhere to be seen. When
they reached the front door of the house the miller was standing on the
threshold, half dressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your son is a clever fellow, miller,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lieutenant</b></font>)</div>said the lieutenant; `but it would
have been much better for him (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) had come quiet.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a matter of opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Loveday.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s in the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) may be; and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) may not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know where he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not; and if I did I shouldn't tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Naturally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard steps beating up the road, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the sergeant.

<p/>They turned from the door, and leaving four of the marines to keep watch
round the house, the remainder of the party marched into the lane as far
as where the other road branched off. While they were pausing to decide
which course to take, one of the soldiers held up the light. A black
object was discernible upon the ground before them, and they found it to
be a hat--the hat of Bob Loveday.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are on the track,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>cried the sergeant, deciding for this direction.

<p/>They tore on rapidly, and the footsteps previously heard became audible
again, increasing in clearness, which told that they gained upon the
fugitive, who in another five minutes stopped and turned. The rays of
the candle fell upon Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) frightened face.

<p/>They made no reply, but wheeled round and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sank down on the
bank to rest, having done all she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could. It was she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) who had taken down
Bob's hat from a nail, and dropped it at the turning with the view of
misleading them till he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) should have got clear off.




<p/>XXXII. DELIVERANCE


<p/>But Anne Garland was too anxious to remain long away from the centre of
operations. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) got back she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found that the press-gang were
standing in the court discussing their next move.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Waste no more time here,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lieutenant</b></font>)</div>the lieutenant said. <div class="bookquote">``Two more villages to
visit to-night, and the nearest three miles off. There's nobody else in
this place, and we can't come back again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the marines</b></font>)</div><p/>When they were moving away, one of the private marines, who had kept his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>)
eye on Anne, and noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) distress, contrived to say in a whisper as
he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``We are coming back again as soon as it begins to get
light; that's only said to deceive `ee. Keep your young man out of the
way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>They went as they had come; and the little household then met together,
Mrs. Loveday having by this time dressed herself and come down. A long
and anxious discussion followed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Somebody must have told upon the chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>Loveday remarked. <div class="bookquote">``How should
they have found him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) out else, now he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s been home from sea this
twelvemonth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne then mentioned what the friendly marine had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>); and fearing
lest Bob was in the house, and would be discovered there when daylight
came, they searched and called for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) everywhere.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What clothes has he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) got on?''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) lovely new suit,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``I warrant it is quite spoiled!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s got no hat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Loveday, `you two go and lie down now and I'll bide up; and
as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) comes in, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)'ll do most likely in the course of the
night, I'll let him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) know that they are coming again.''

<p/>Anne and Mrs. Loveday went to their bedrooms, and the miller entered the
mill as if he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) were simply staying up to grind. But he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) continually left
the flour-shoot to go outside and walk round; each time he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) could see no
living being near the spot. Anne meanwhile had lain down dressed upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) bed, the window still open, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ears intent upon the sound of
footsteps and dreading the reappearance of daylight and the gang's
return. Three or four times during the night she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) descended to the mill
to inquire of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) stepfather if Bob had shown himself; but the answer was
always in the negative.

<p/>At length the curtains of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) bed began to reveal their pattern, the
brass handles of the drawers gleamed forth, and day dawned. While the
light was yet no more than a suffusion of pallor, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) arose, put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
hat, and determined to explore the surrounding premises before the men
arrived. Emerging into the raw loneliness of the daybreak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went upon
the bridge and looked up and down the road. It was as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had left it,
empty, and the solitude was rendered yet more insistent by the silence of
the mill-wheel, which was now stopped, the miller having given up
expecting Bob and retired to bed about three o'clock. The footprints of
the marines still remained in the dust on the bridge, all the heel-marks
towards the house, showing that the party had not as yet returned.

<p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lingered she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heard a slight noise in the other direction, and,
turning, saw a woman approaching. The woman came up quickly, and, to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
amazement, Anne recognized Matilda. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) walk was convulsive, face pale,
almost haggard, and the cold light of the morning invested it with all
the ghostliness of death. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had plainly walked all the way from
Budmouth, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) shoes were covered with dust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has the press-gang been here?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) gasped. <div class="bookquote">``If not they are coming!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They have been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And got him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)--I am too late!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No; they are coming back again. Why did you--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I came to try to save him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>). Can we save him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)? Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne looked the woman in the face, and it was impossible to doubt that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was in earnest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I am trying to find him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) before they
come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you not let me help you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Matilda</b></font>)</div>cried the repentant Matilda.

<p/>Without either objecting or assenting Anne turned and led the way to the
back part of the homestead.

<p/>Matilda, too, had suffered that night. From the moment of parting with
Festus Derriman a sentiment of revulsion from the act to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) had
been a party set in and increased, till at length it reached an intensity
of remorse which she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) could not passively bear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) had risen before day
and hastened thitherward to know the worst, and if possible hinder
consequences that she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) had been the first to set in train.

<p/>After going hither and thither in the adjoining field, Anne entered the
garden. The walks were bathed in grey dew, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) passed observantly
along them it appeared as if they had been brushed by some foot at a much
earlier hour. At the end of the garden, bushes of broom, laurel, and yew
formed a constantly encroaching shrubbery, that had come there almost by
chance, and was never trimmed. Behind these bushes was a garden-seat,
and upon it lay Bob sound asleep.

<p/>The ends of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) hair were clotted with damp, and there was a foggy film
upon the mirror-like buttons of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) coat, and upon the buckles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
shoes. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) bunch of new gold seals was dimmed by the same insidious
dampness; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) shirt-frill and muslin neckcloth were limp as seaweed. It
was plain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had been there a long time. Anne shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) did
not awake, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) breathing being slow and stertorous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bob, wake; `tis your own Anne!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, with innocent earnestness; and
then, fearfully turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw that Matilda was close behind
her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't mind me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matilda/Miss Johnson/Matilda Johnson</b></font>)</div>said Matilda bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``I am on your side now.
Shake him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) again, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) slept on. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) noticed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
forehead bore the mark of a heavy wound.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy I hear something!''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) companion, starting forward and
endeavouring to wake Bob herself. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) is stunned, or drugged!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said;
`there is no rousing him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>).''

<p/>Anne raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head and listened. From the direction of the eastern
road came the sound of a steady tramp. <div class="bookquote">``They are coming back!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said,
clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``They will take him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), ill as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) is! He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) won't open
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) eyes--no, it is no use! O, what shall we do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Matilda/Miss Johnson/Matilda Johnson</b></font>)</div><p/>Matilda did not reply, but running to the end of the seat on which Bob
lay, tried its weight in her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not too heavy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You take that end, and I'll take this.
We'll carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) away to some place of hiding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne instantly seized the other end, and they proceeded with their burden
at a slow pace to the lower garden-gate, which they reached as the tread
of the press-gang resounded over the bridge that gave access to the mill
court, now hidden from view by the hedge and the trees of the garden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will go down inside this field,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other; `they will see our foot-tracks in the dew. We must
go into the road.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the very road they will come down when they leave the mill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It cannot be helped; it is neck or nothing with us now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So they emerged upon the road, and staggered along without speaking,
occasionally resting for a moment to ease their arms; then shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) to
arouse him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), and finding it useless, seizing the seat again. When they
had gone about two hundred yards Matilda betrayed signs of exhaustion,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``Is there no shelter near?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When we get to that little field of corn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so very far. Surely there is some place near?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) pointed to a few scrubby bushes overhanging a little stream, which
passed under the road near this point.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are not thick enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us take him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) under the bridge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matilda/Miss Johnson/Matilda Johnson</b></font>)</div>said Matilda. <div class="bookquote">``I can go no further.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Entering the opening by which cattle descended to drink, they waded into
the weedy water, which here rose a few inches above their ankles. To
ascend the stream, stoop under the arch, and reach the centre of the
roadway, was the work of a few minutes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If they look under the arch we are lost,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>murmured Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no parapet to the bridge, and they may pass over without
heeding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They waited, their heads almost in contact with the reeking arch, and
their feet encircled by the stream, which was at its summer lowness now.
For some minutes they could hear nothing but the babble of the water over
their ankles, and round the legs of the seat on which Bob slumbered, the
sounds being reflected in a musical tinkle from the hollow sides of the
arch. Anne's anxiety now was lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) should not continue sleeping till
the search was over, but start up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) habitual imprudence, and
scorning such means of safety, rush out into their arms.

<p/>A quarter of an hour dragged by, and then indications reached their ears
that the re-examination of the mill had begun and ended. The well-known
tramp drew nearer, and reverberated through the ground over their heads,
where its volume signified to the listeners that the party had been
largely augmented by pressed men since the night preceding. The gang
passed the arch, and the noise regularly diminished, as if no man among
them had thought of looking aside for a moment.

<p/>Matilda broke the silence. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder if they have left a watch behind?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) said doubtfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go and see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne. <div class="bookquote">``Wait till I return.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I can do no more. When you come back I shall be gone. I ask one
thing of you. If all goes well with you and him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) marries
you--don't be alarmed; my plans lie elsewhere--when you are his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) wife tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) who helped to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) away. But don't mention my name to the rest
of your family, either now or at any time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne regarded the speaker for a moment, and promised; after which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
waded out from the archway.

<p/>Matilda stood looking at Bob for a moment, as if preparing to go, till
moved by some impulse she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) bent and lightly kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>cried Anne reproachfully. When leaving the mouth of the
arch she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had bent back and seen the act.

<p/>Matilda flushed. <div class="bookquote">``You jealous baby!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) said scornfully.

<p/>Anne hesitated for a moment, then went out from the water, and hastened
towards the mill.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) entered by the garden, and, seeing no one, advanced and peeped in at
the window. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother and Mr. Loveday were sitting within as usual.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they all gone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. They did not trouble us much, beyond going into every room, and
searching about the garden, where they saw steps. They have been lucky
to-night; they have caught fifteen or twenty men at places further on; so
the loss of Bob was no hurt to their feelings. I wonder where in the
world the poor fellow is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will show you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne. And explaining in a few words what had
happened, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was promptly followed by David and Loveday along the road.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) dress and entered the arch with some anxiety on account of
Matilda; but the actress was gone, and Bob lay on the seat as she (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) had
left him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>).

<p/>Bob was brought out, and water thrown upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) face; but though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) moved
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) did not rouse himself until some time after he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had been borne into the
house. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) eyes, and saw them standing round, and
gathered a little consciousness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are all right, my boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``What hev happened to ye?
Where did ye get that terrible blow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--I can mind now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>murmured Bob, with a stupefied gaze around. <div class="bookquote">``I
fell in slipping down the topsail halyard--the rope, that is, was too
short--and I fell upon my head. And then I went away. When I came back
I thought I wouldn't disturb ye: so I lay down out there, to sleep out
the watch; but the pain in my head was so great that I couldn't get to
sleep; so I picked some of the poppy-heads in the border, which I once
heard was a good thing for sending folks to sleep when they are in pain.
So I munched up all I could find, and dropped off quite nicely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I wondered who had picked ``em!'' said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``I noticed they were gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you might never have woke again!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Loveday, holding up her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
hands. <div class="bookquote">``How is your head now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hardly know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the young man, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead
and beginning to doze again. <div class="bookquote">``Where be those fellows that boarded us?
With this--smooth water and--fine breeze we ought to get away from 'em.
Haul in--the larboard braces, and--bring her (<font color='blue'><b>fellows</b></font>) to the wind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are at home, dear Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, bending over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), `and the men
are gone.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along upstairs: th' beest hardly awake now,''  (<font color='red'><b>father Bob</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father and
Bob was assisted to bed.




<p/>XXXIII. A DISCOVERY TURNS THE SCALE


<p/>In four-and-twenty hours Bob had recovered. But though physically
himself again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was not at all sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) position as a patriot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
had that practical knowledge of seamanship of which the country stood
much in need, and it was humiliating to find that impressment seemed to
be necessary to teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) to use it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) advantage. Many neighbouring
young men, less fortunate than himself, had been pressed and taken; and
their absence seemed a reproach to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) went away by himself into the
mill-roof, and, surrounded by the corn-heaps, gave vent to
self-condemnation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, I am no man to lie here so long for the pleasure of sighting
that young girl forty times a day, and letting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sight me--bless her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
eyes!--till I must needs want a press-gang to teach me what I've forgot.
And is it then all over with me as a British sailor? We'll see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was thrown under the influence of Anne's eyes again, which were
more tantalizingly beautiful than ever just now -LRB-so it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)-RRB-,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) intention of offering his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) services to the Government would wax
weaker, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) would put off his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) final decision till the next day. Anne
saw these fluctuations of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) mind between love and patriotism, and being
terrified by what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had heard of sea-fights, used the utmost art of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was capable to seduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) forming purpose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) came
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) in the mill, wearing the very prettiest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) morning jackets--the
one that only just passed the waist, and was laced so tastefully round
the collar and bosom. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would appear in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) new hat, with a
bouquet of primroses on one side; and on the following Sunday she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) walked
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) in lemon-coloured boots, so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) feet looked like a pair
of yellow-hammers flitting under her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) dress.

<p/>But dress was the least of the means she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) adopted for chaining him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) down.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) talked more tenderly than ever; asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) to begin small undertakings
in the garden on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) account; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sang about the house, that the place
might seem cheerful when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) came in. This singing for a purpose required
great effort on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) part, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) afterwards very sad. When Bob
asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) what was the matter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``Nothing; only I am
thinking how you will grieve your father, and cross his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) purposes, if you
carry out your unkind notion of going to sea, and forsaking your place in
the mill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>Bob would say uneasily. <div class="bookquote">``It will trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Being also quite aware how it would trouble her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) would again postpone,
and thus another week passed away.

<p/>All this time John had not come once to the mill. It appeared as if Miss
Johnson absorbed all his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) time and thoughts. Bob was often seen chuckling
over the circumstance. <div class="bookquote">``A sly rascal!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Pretending on the day
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came to be married that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not good enough for me, when it was
only that he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for himself. How he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) could have persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to
go away is beyond me to say!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne could not contest this belief of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lover's, and remained silent;
but there had more than once occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mind a doubt of its
probability. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had only abandoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) opinion that John had
schemed for Matilda, to embrace the opposite error; that, finding he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had
wronged the young lady, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had pitied and grown to love her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet Jack, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was a boy, was the simplest fellow alive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>resumed
Bob. <div class="bookquote">``By George, though, I should have been hot against him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) for such a
trick, if in losing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) I hadn't found a better! But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll never come
down to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) in the world: she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has high notions now. I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'s
doomed to sigh in vain!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>Though Bob regretted this possibility, the feeling was not reciprocated
by Anne. It was true that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew nothing of Matilda's temporary
treachery, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) disbelieved the story of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lack of virtue; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not like the woman. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it will not matter if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is doomed
to sigh in vain,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But I owe him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) no ill-will. I have profited
by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) doings, incomprehensible as they are.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) fair eyes
on Bob and smiled.

<p/>Bob looked dubious. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has affronted me, now I have seen
through him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and that I shall be against meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). But, of course, I
am not so touchy. I can stand a practical joke, as can any man who has
been afloat. I'll call and see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) started, Bob bethought him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) of something which would still
further prove to the misapprehending John that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was entirely forgiven.
He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) went to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) room, and took from his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) chest a packet containing a lock
of Miss Johnson's hair, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) during their brief
acquaintance, and which till now he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had quite forgotten. When, at
starting, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wished Anne goodbye, it was accompanied by such a beaming
face, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was full of an idea, and asked what it might be
that pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, smacking his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) breast-pocket. <div class="bookquote">``A lock of hair that
Matilda gave me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne sank back with parted lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to give it to Jack--he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'ll jump for joy to get it! And it
will show him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) how willing I am to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), fine piece as she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>)
is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you see her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) to-day, Bob?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>Anne asked with an uncertain smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O no--unless it is by accident.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>On reaching the outskirts of the town he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) went straight to the barracks,
and was lucky enough to find John in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) room, at the left-hand corner of
the quadrangle. John was glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>); but to Bob's surprise he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
showed no immediate contrition, and thus afforded no room for the
brotherly speech of forgiveness which Bob had been going to deliver. As
the trumpet-major did not open the subject, Bob felt it desirable to
begin himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have brought ye something that you will value, Jack,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said, as they
sat at the window, overlooking the large square barrack-yard. <div class="bookquote">``I have
got no further use for it, and you should have had it before if it had
entered my head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Bob; what is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John, looking absently at an awkward
squad of young men who were drilling in the enclosure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis a young woman's lock of hair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John, quite recovering from his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) abstraction, and slightly
flushing. Could Bob and Anne have quarrelled? Bob drew the paper from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) pocket, and opened it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Black!''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--black enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Why, Matilda<div class="bookquote">``s.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``O, Matilda<div class="bookquote">``s!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose did you think then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Instead of replying, the trumpet-major's face became as red as sunset,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) turned to the window to hide his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) confusion.

<p/>Bob was silent, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), too, looked into the court. At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
arose, walked to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) brother, and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) shoulder.
<div class="bookquote">``Jack,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said, in an altered voice, `you are a good fellow. Now I see
it all.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O no--that's nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John hastily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've been pretending that you care for this woman that I mightn't
blame myself for heaving you out from the other--which is what I've done
without knowing it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it does matter! I've been making you unhappy all these weeks and
weeks through my thoughtlessness. They seemed to think at home, you
know, John, that you had grown not to care for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); or I wouldn't have
done it for all the world!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You stick to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), Bob, and never mind me. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) belongs to you. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
loves you. I have no claim upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thinks nothing about me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) likes you, John, thoroughly well; so does everybody; and if I hadn't
come home, putting my foot in it-- That coming home of mine has been a
regular blight upon the family! I ought never to have stayed. The sea
is my home, and why couldn't I bide there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>The trumpet-major drew Bob's discourse off the subject as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
could, and Bob, after some unconsidered replies and remarks, seemed
willing to avoid it for the present. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) did not ask John to accompany
him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) home, as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had intended; and on leaving the barracks turned
southward and entered the town to wander about till he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could decide what
to do.

<p/>It was the 3rd of September, but the King's watering-place still retained
its summer aspect. The royal bathing-machine had been drawn out just as
Bob reached Gloucester Buildings, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) waited a minute, in the lack of
other distraction, to look on. Immediately that the King's machine had
entered the water a group of florid men with fiddles, violoncellos, a
trombone, and a drum, came forward, packed themselves into another
machine that was in waiting, and were drawn out into the waves in the
King's rear. All that was to be heard for a few minutes were the slow
pulsations of the sea; and then a deafening noise burst from the interior
of the second machine with power enough to split the boards asunder; it
was the condensed mass of musicians inside, striking up the strains of
<div class="bookquote">``God save the King,''  (<font color='red'><b>musicians</b></font>)</div>as his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) Majesty's head rose from the water. Bob took
off his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) hat and waited till the end of the performance, which, intended
as a pleasant surprise to George III. by the loyal burghers, was possibly
in the watery circumstances tolerated rather than desired by that
dripping monarch. -LCB-303-RCB-

<p/>Loveday then passed on to the harbour, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) remained awhile, looking
at the busy scene of loading and unloading craft and swabbing the decks
of yachts; at the boats and barges rubbing against the quay wall, and at
the houses of the merchants, some ancient structures of solid stone,
others green-shuttered with heavy wooden bow-windows which appeared as if
about to drop into the harbour by their own weight. All these things he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
gazed upon, and thought of one thing--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had caused great misery to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) brother John.

<p/>The town clock struck, and Bob retraced his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) steps till he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) again
approached the Esplanade and Gloucester Lodge, where the morning sun
blazed in upon the house fronts, and not a spot of shade seemed to be
attainable. A huzzaing attracted his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) attention, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) observed that a
number of people had gathered before the King's residence, where a brown
curricle had stopped, out of which stepped a hale man in the prime of
life, wearing a blue uniform, gilt epaulettes, cocked hat, and sword, who
crossed the pavement and went in. Bob went up and joined the group.
<div class="bookquote">``What's going on?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain Hardy,''  (<font color='red'><b>a bystander</b></font>)</div>replied a bystander.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just gone in--waiting to see the King.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the captain is in the West Indies?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. The fleet is come home; they can't find the French anywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will they go and look for them again?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>asked Bob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes. Nelson is determined to find 'em. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>)'s refitted
he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>)'ll put to sea again. Ah, here's the King coming in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob was so interested in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had just heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) scarcely noticed
the arrival of the King, and a body of attendant gentlemen. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) went on
thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) new knowledge; Captain Hardy was come. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>) was doubtless
staying with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>) family at their small manor-house at Pos`ham, a few
miles from Overcombe, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>) usually spent the intervals between his (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>)
different cruises.

<p/>Loveday returned to the mill without further delay; and shortly
explaining that John was very well, and would come soon, went on to talk
of the arrival of Nelson's captain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And is he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) come at last?''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller, throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) thoughts years
backward. <div class="bookquote">``Well can I mind when he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) first left home to go on board the
Helena as midshipman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not much to remember. I can remember it too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Loveday.

<p/>''`Tis more than twenty years ago anyhow. And more than that, I can mind
when he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) was born; I was a lad, serving my `prenticeship at the time. He (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>)
has been in this house often and often when 'a was young. When he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) came
home after his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) first voyage he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) stayed about here a long time, and used to
look in at the mill whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) went past. ``What will you be next, sir?''
said mother to him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) one day as he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) back to the doorpost. ``A
lieutenant, Dame Loveday,'' says he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>). ``And what next?'' says she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). ``A
commander.'' ``And next?'' ``Next, post-captain.'' ``And then?'' ``Then it
will be almost time to die.<div class="bookquote">'' I'd warrant that he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>)'d mind it to this very
day if you were to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob heard all this with a manner of preoccupation, and soon retired to
the mill. Thence he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) room by the back passage, and taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
old seafaring garments from a dark closet in the wall conveyed them to
the loft at the top of the mill, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) occupied the remaining spare
moments of the day in brushing the mildew from their folds, and hanging
each article by the window to get aired. In the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) returned to
the loft, and dressing himself in the old salt suit, went out of the
house unobserved by anybody, and ascended the road towards Captain
Hardy's native village and present temporary home.

<p/>The shadeless downs were now brown with the droughts of the passing
summer, and few living things met his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) view, the natural rotundity of the
elevation being only occasionally disturbed by the presence of a barrow,
a thorn-bush, or a piece of dry wall which remained from some attempted
enclosure. By the time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) reached the village it was dark, and the
larger stars had begun to shine when he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) walked up to the door of the old-
fashioned house which was the family residence of this branch of the
South-Wessex Hardys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will the captain allow me to wait on him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) to-night?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>inquired Loveday,
explaining who and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) was.

<p/>The servant went away for a few minutes, and then told Bob that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) might
see the captain in the morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If that's the case, I'll come again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>replied Bob, quite cheerful that
failure was not absolute.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had left the door but a few steps when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was called back and asked if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had walked all the way from Overcombe Mill on purpose.

<p/>Loveday replied modestly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had done so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then will you come in?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) followed the speaker into a small study or
office, and in a minute or two Captain Hardy entered.

<p/>The captain at this time was a bachelor of thirty-five, rather stout in
build, with light eyes, bushy eyebrows, a square broad face, plenty of
chin, and a mouth whose corners played between humour and grimness. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)
surveyed Loveday from top to toe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Robert Loveday, sir, son of the miller at Overcombe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob, making a
low bow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I remember your father, Loveday,''  (<font color='red'><b>the seaman</b></font>)</div>the gallant seaman replied.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, what do you want to say to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>Seeing that Bob found it rather
difficult to begin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) leant leisurely against the mantelpiece, and went
on, <div class="bookquote">``Is your father well and hearty? I have not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for many, many
years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>``Quite well, thank <div class="bookquote">``ee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You used to have a brother in the army, I think? What was his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
name--John? A very fine fellow, if I recollect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, cap'n; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s there still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are in the merchant-service?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Late first mate of the brig Pewit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How is it you're not on board a man-of-war?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, sir, that's the thing I've come about,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob, recovering
confidence. <div class="bookquote">``I should have been, but `tis womankind has hampered me.
I've waited and waited on at home because of a young woman--lady, I might
have said, for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s sprung from a higher class of society than I. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
father was a landscape painter--maybe you've heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), sir? The name
is Garland.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) painted that view of our village here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain Hardy, looking
towards a dark little picture in the corner of the room.

<p/>Bob looked, and went on, as if to the picture, <div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, I have found
that-- However, the press-gang came a week or two ago, and didn't get
hold of me. I didn't care to go aboard as a pressed man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There has been a severe impressment. It is of course a disagreeable
necessity, but it can't be helped.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Since then, sir, something has happened that makes me wish they had
found me, and I have come to-night to ask if I could enter on board your
ship the Victory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The captain</b></font>)</div><p/>The captain shook his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) head severely, and presently observed: <div class="bookquote">``I am glad
to find that you think of entering the service, Loveday; smart men are
badly wanted. But it will not be in your power to choose your ship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The captain</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, sir; then I must take my chance elsewhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
face indicating the disappointment he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) would not fully express. <div class="bookquote">'''Twas
only that I felt I would much rather serve under you than anybody else,
my father and all of us being known to ye, Captain Hardy, and our
families belonging to the same parts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Captain Hardy took Bob's altitude more carefully. <div class="bookquote">``Are you a good
practical seaman?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>) asked musingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, sir; I believe I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Active? Fond of skylarking?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't know about the last. I think I can say I am active
enough. I could walk the yard-arm, if required, cross from mast to mast
by the stays, and do what most fellows do who call themselves spry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The captain</b></font>)</div><p/>The captain then put some questions about the details of navigation,
which Loveday, having luckily been used to square rigs, answered
satisfactorily. <div class="bookquote">``As to reefing topsails,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) added, `if I don't do it
like a flash of lightning, I can do it so that they will stand blowing
weather. The Pewit was not a dull vessel, and when we were convoyed home
from Lisbon, she (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) could keep well in sight of the frigate scudding at a
distance, by putting on full sail. We had enough hands aboard to reef
topsails man-o'-war fashion, which is a rare thing in these days, sir,
now that able seamen are so scarce on trading craft. And I hear that men
from square-rigged vessels are liked much the best in the navy, as being
more ready for use? So that I shouldn't be altogether so raw,'' said Bob
earnestly, `if I could enter on your ship, sir. Still, if I can't, I
can<div class="bookquote">``t.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I might ask for you, Loveday,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>said the captain thoughtfully, `and so
get you there that way. In short, I think I may say I will ask for you.
So consider it settled.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My thanks to you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Loveday.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are aware that the Victory is a smart ship, and that cleanliness and
order are, of necessity, more strictly insisted upon there than in some
others?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, I quite see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I hope you will do your duty as well on a line-of-battle ship as
you did when mate of the brig, for it is a duty that may be serious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob replied that it should be his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) one endeavour; and receiving a few
instructions for getting on board the guard-ship, and being conveyed to
Portsmouth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) turned to go away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll have a stiff walk before you fetch Overcombe Mill this dark
night, Loveday,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>concluded the captain, peering out of the window. <div class="bookquote">``I'll
send you in a glass of grog to help `ee on your way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The captain</b></font>)</div><p/>The captain then left Bob to himself, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had drunk the grog that
was brought in he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) started homeward, with a heart not exactly light, but
large with a patriotic cheerfulness, which had not diminished when, after
walking so fast in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) excitement as to be beaded with perspiration, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father's door.

<p/>They were all sitting up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), and at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) approach anxiously raised
their sleepy eyes, for it was nearly eleven o'clock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There; I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)'d not be much longer!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>cried Anne, jumping up and
laughing, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) relief. <div class="bookquote">``They have been thinking you were very strange
and silent to-day, Bob; you were not, were you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter, Bob?''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller; for Bob's countenance was
sublimed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) recent interview, like that of a priest just come from
the penetralia of the temple.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) mate's clothes, just as when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) came home!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Loveday</b></font>)</div>observed Mrs.
Loveday.

<p/>They all saw now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had something to tell. <div class="bookquote">``I am going away,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
said when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had sat down. <div class="bookquote">``I am going to enter on board a man-of-war,
and perhaps it will be the Victory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Going?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, don't you mind it, there's a dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) went on solemnly, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) own. ``And you, father, don't you begin to take it to heart'
-LRB-the miller was looking grave-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``The press-gang has been here, and
though I showed them that I was a free man, I am going to show everybody
that I can do my duty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Neither of the other three answered, Anne and the miller having their
eyes bent upon the ground, and the former trying to repress her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now don't you grieve, either of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) continued; `nor vex yourselves
that this has happened. Please not to be angry with me, father, for
deserting you and the mill, where you want me, for I _must go_. For
these three years we and the rest of the country have been in fear of the
enemy; trade has been hindered; poor folk made hungry; and many rich folk
made poor. There must be a deliverance, and it must be done by sea. I
have seen Captain Hardy, and I shall serve under him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) if so be I can.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain Hardy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I have been to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) house at Pos`ham, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)'s staying with his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
sisters; walked there and back, and I wouldn't have missed it for fifty
guineas. I hardly thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) would see me; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) did see me. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
hasn't forgot you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob then opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) tale in order, relating graphically the conversation
to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had been a party, and they listened with breathless
attention.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if you must go, you must,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller with emotion; `but I
think it somewhat hard that, of my two sons, neither one of 'em can be
got to stay and help me in my business as I get old.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't trouble and vex about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Loveday soothingly. <div class="bookquote">``They
are both instruments in the hands of Providence, chosen to chastise that
Corsican ogre, and do what they can for the country in these trying
years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just the shape of it, Mrs. Loveday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>ogre</b></font>)'ll come back soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) continued, turning to Anne. <div class="bookquote">``And then
he (<font color='blue'><b>ogre</b></font>)'ll tell us all he (<font color='blue'><b>ogre</b></font>) has seen, and the glory that he (<font color='blue'><b>ogre</b></font>)'s won, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>ogre</b></font>)
has helped to sweep that scourge Buonaparty off the earth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When be you going, Bob?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father inquired.

<p/>``To-morrow, if I can. I shall call at the barracks and tell John as I go
by. When I get to Portsmouth--'

<p/>A burst of sobs in quick succession interrupted his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) words; they came from
Anne, who till that moment had been sitting as before with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand in
that of Bob, and apparently quite calm. Mrs. Loveday jumped up, but
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) could say anything to soothe the agitated girl she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had calmed
herself with the same singular suddenness that had marked her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) giving way.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't mind Bob's going,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) ought to go. Don't
suppose, Bob, that I want you to stay!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>After this she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) left the apartment, and went into the little side room
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) mother usually worked. In a few moments Bob followed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) came back he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was in a very sad and emotional mood. Anybody
could see that there had been a parting of profound anguish to both.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) is not coming back to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will see her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) to-morrow before you go?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I may or I may not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Father and Mrs. Loveday, do you go to
bed now. I have got to look over my things and get ready; and it will
take me some little time. If you should hear noises you will know it is
only myself moving about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>When Bob was left alone he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) suddenly became brisk, and set himself to
overhaul his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) clothes and other possessions in a business-like manner. By
the time that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) chest was packed, such things as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) meant to leave at
home folded into cupboards, and what was useless destroyed, it was past
two o'clock. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) went to bed, so softly that only the creak of one
weak stair revealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) passage upward. At the moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) passed
Anne's chamber-door her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother was bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lay in bed,
and saying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Won't you see him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) in the morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I would rather not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)! I have said that I
may. But I shall not. I cannot see him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the family</b></font>)</div><p/>When the family got up next day Bob had vanished. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) way to
disappear like this, to avoid affecting scenes at parting. By the time
that they had sat down to a gloomy breakfast, Bob was in the boat of a
Budmouth waterman, who pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) alongside the guardship in the roads,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) laid hold of the man-rope, mounted, and disappeared from
external view. In the course of the day the ship moved off, set her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
royals, and made sail for Portsmouth, with five hundred new hands for the
service on board, consisting partly of pressed men and partly of
volunteers, among the latter being Robert Loveday.




<p/>XXXIV. A SPECK ON THE SEA


<p/>In parting from John, who accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to the quay, Bob had said:
<div class="bookquote">``Now, Jack, these be my last words to you: I give her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) up. I go away on
purpose, and I shall be away a long time. If in that time she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) should
list over towards ye ever so little, mind you take her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). You have more
right to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) than I. You chose her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) when my mind was elsewhere, and you
best deserve her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>); for I have never known you forget one woman, while I've
forgot a dozen. Take her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) then, if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) will come, and God bless both of
ye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>Another person besides John saw Bob go. That was Derriman, who was
standing by a bollard a little further up the quay. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) did not repress
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) satisfaction at the sight. John looked towards him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) with an open gaze
of contempt; for the cuffs administered to the yeoman at the inn had not,
so far as the trumpet-major was aware, produced any desire to avenge that
insult, John being, of course, quite ignorant that Festus had erroneously
retaliated upon Bob, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) peculiar though scarcely soldierly way.
Finding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) did not even now approach him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), John went on his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) way, and
thought over his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) intention of preserving intact the love between Anne and
his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) brother.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was surprised when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) next went to the mill to find how glad they all
were to see him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). From the moment of Bob's return to the bosom of the
deep Anne had had no existence on land; people might have looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
human body and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had flitted thence. The sea and all that
belonged to the sea was her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) daily thought and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) nightly dream. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had
the whole two-and-thirty winds under her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eye, each passing gale that
ushered in returning autumn being mentally registered; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) acquired a
precise knowledge of the direction in which Portsmouth, Brest, Ferrol,
Cadiz, and other such likely places lay. Instead of saying her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own
familiar prayers at night she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) substituted, with some confusion of
thought, the Forms of Prayer to be used at sea. John at once noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
lorn, abstracted looks, pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>),--how much he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)!--and asked
when they were alone if there was anything he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are two things,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, with almost childish eagerness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
tired eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They shall be done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The first is to find out if Captain Hardy has gone back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>) ship; and
the other is--O if you will do it, John!--to get me newspapers whenever
possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div><p/>After this duologue John was absent for a space of three hours, and they
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had gone back to barracks. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) entered, however, at the end of
that time, took off his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) forage-cap, and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) forehead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look tired, John,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O no.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) went through the house till he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had found Anne Garland.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have only done one of those things,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, already! I didn't hope for or mean to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain Hardy is gone from Pos`ham. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>) left some days ago. We shall
soon hear that the fleet has sailed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been all the way to Pos`ham on purpose? How good of you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I was anxious to know myself when Bob is likely to leave. I
expect now that we shall soon hear from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Two days later he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) came again. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) brought a newspaper, and what was
better, a letter for Anne, franked by the first lieutenant of the
Victory.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s aboard her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eagerly took the letter.

<p/>It was short, but as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could expect in the circumstances, and
informed them that the captain had been as good as his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) word, and had
gratified Bob's earnest wish to serve under him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>). The ship, with Admiral
Lord Nelson on board, and accompanied by the frigate Euryalus, was to
sail in two days for Plymouth, where they would be joined by others, and
thence proceed to the coast of Spain.

<p/>Anne lay awake that night thinking of the Victory, and of those who
floated in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). To the best of Anne's calculation that ship of war
would, during the next twenty-four hours, pass within a few miles of
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) herself then lay. Next to seeing Bob, the thing that would
give her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) more pleasure than any other in the world was to see the vessel
that contained him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)--his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) floating city, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) sole dependence in battle and
storm--upon whose safety from winds and enemies hung all her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hope.

<p/>The morrow was market-day at the seaport, and in this she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
opportunity. A carrier went from Overcombe at six o'clock thither, and
having to do a little shopping for herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) gave it as a reason for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) intended day's absence, and took a place in the van. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
reached the town it was still early morning, but the borough was already
in the zenith of its daily bustle and show. The King was always out-of-
doors by six o'clock, and such cock-crow hours at Gloucester Lodge
produced an equally forward stir among the population. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) alighted, and
passed down the esplanade, as fully thronged by persons of fashion at
this time of mist and level sunlight as a watering-place in the present
day is at four in the afternoon. Dashing bucks and beaux in cocked hats,
black feathers, ruffles, and frills, stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hurried along;
the beach was swarming with bathing women, wearing waistbands that bore
the national refrain, <div class="bookquote">``God save the King,''  (<font color='red'><b>bathing women</b></font>)</div>in gilt letters; the shops
were all open, and Sergeant Stanner, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stanner</b></font>) sword-stuck bank-notes and
heroic gaze, was beating up at two guineas and a crown, the crown to
drink his (<font color='blue'><b>Stanner</b></font>) Majesty's health.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) soon finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) shopping, and then, crossing over into the old
town, pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) way along the coast-road to Portland. At the end of an
hour she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been rowed across the Fleet -LRB-which then lacked the
convenience of a bridge-RRB-, and reached the base of Portland Hill. The
steep incline before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was dotted with houses, showing the pleasant
peculiarity of one man's doorstep being behind his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neighbour's chimney,
and slabs of stone as the common material for walls, roof, floor, pig-
sty, stable-manger, door-scraper, and garden-stile. Anne gained the
summit, and followed along the central track over the huge lump of
freestone which forms the peninsula, the wide sea prospect extending as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went on. Weary with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) journey, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) approached the extreme
southerly peak of rock, and gazed from the cliff at Portland Bill, or
Beal, as it was in those days more correctly called.

<p/>The wild, herbless, weather-worn promontory was quite a solitude, and,
saving the one old lighthouse about fifty yards up the slope, scarce a
mark was visible to show that humanity had ever been near the spot. Anne
found herself a seat on a stone, and swept with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes the tremulous
expanse of water around her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) that seemed to utter a ceaseless
unintelligible incantation. Out of the three hundred and sixty degrees
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) complete horizon two hundred and fifty were covered by waves, the
coup d'oeil including the area of troubled waters known as the Race,
where two seas met to effect the destruction of such vessels as could not
be mastered by one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) counted the craft within her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) view: there were
five; no, there were only four; no, there were seven, some of the specks
having resolved themselves into two. They were all small coasters, and
kept well within sight of land.

<p/>Anne sank into a reverie. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heard a slight noise on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) left
hand, and turning beheld an old sailor, who had approached with a glass.
He (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) was levelling it over the sea in a direction to the south-east, and
somewhat removed from that in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own eyes had been wandering. Anne
moved a few steps thitherward, so as to unclose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) view a deeper
sweep on that side, and by this discovered a ship of far larger size than
any which had yet dotted the main before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Its sails were for the
most part new and clean, and in comparison with its rapid progress before
the wind the small brigs and ketches seemed standing still. Upon this
striking object the old man's glass was bent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you see, sailor?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Almost nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``My sight is so gone off lately that
things, one and all, be but a November mist to me. And yet I fain would
see to-day. I am looking for the Victory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a son aboard her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s one of three from these parts. There's
the captain, there's my son Ned, and there's young Loveday of
Overcombe--he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) that lately joined.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I look for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, after a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, mis`ess, if so be you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne took the glass, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) supported it by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm. <div class="bookquote">``It is a large
ship,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, `with three masts, three rows of guns along the side,
and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sails set.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I guessed as much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a little flag in front--over her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) bowsprit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The jack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And there's a large one flying at her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) stern.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The ensign.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And a white one on her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) fore-topmast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the admiral's flag, the flag of my Lord Nelson. What is her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)
figure-head, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A coat-of-arms, supported on this side by a sailor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) companion nodded with satisfaction. <div class="bookquote">``On the other side of that
figure-head is a marine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) is twisting round in a curious way, and her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) sails sink in like old
cheeks, and she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) shivers like a leaf upon a tree.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) is in stays, for the larboard tack. I can see what she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)'s been
doing. She (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)'s been re`ching close in to avoid the flood tide, as the wind
is to the sou'-west, and she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)'s bound down; but as soon as the ebb made,
d'ye see, they made sail to the west`ard. Captain Hardy may be depended
upon for that; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>) knows every current about here, being a native.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now I can see the other side; it is a soldier where a sailor was
before. You are _sure_ it is the Victory?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>After this a frigate came into view--the Euryalus--sailing in the same
direction. Anne sat down, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes never left the ships. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me
more about the Victory,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) is the best sailer in the service, and she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) carries a hundred guns.
The heaviest be on the lower deck, the next size on the middle deck, the
next on the main and upper decks. My son Ned's place is on the lower
deck, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>)'s short, and they put the short men below.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob, though not tall, was not likely to be specially selected for
shortness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) pictured him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) on the upper deck, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) snow-white
trousers and jacket of navy blue, looking perhaps towards the very point
of land where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) then was.

<p/>The great silent ship, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) population of blue-jackets, marines,
officers, captain, and the admiral who was not to return alive, passed
like a phantom the meridian of the Bill. Sometimes her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) aspect was that
of a large white bat, sometimes that of a grey one. In the course of
time the watching girl saw that the ship had passed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) nearest point;
the breadth of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sails diminished by foreshortening, till she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) assumed
the form of an egg on end. After this something seemed to twinkle, and
Anne, who had previously withdrawn from the old sailor, went back to him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>),
and looked again through the glass. The twinkling was the light falling
upon the cabin windows of the ship's stern. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) explained it to the old
man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we see now what the enemy have seen but once. That was in seventy-
nine, when she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) sighted the French and Spanish fleet off Scilly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)
retreated because she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) feared a landing. Well, `tis a brave ship and she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)
carries brave men!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne's tender bosom heaved, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said nothing, and again became
absorbed in contemplation.

<p/>The Victory was fast dropping away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was on the horizon, and soon
appeared hull down. That seemed to be like the beginning of a greater
end than her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) present vanishing. Anne Garland could not stay by the
sailor any longer, and went about a stone's-throw off, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was
hidden by the inequality of the cliff from his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) view. The vessel was now
exactly end on, and stood out in the direction of the Start, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) width
having contracted to the proportion of a feather. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sat down again,
and mechanically took out some biscuits that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had brought, foreseeing
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) waiting might be long. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not eat one of them;
eating seemed to jar with the mental tenseness of the moment; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
undeviating gaze continued to follow the lessened ship with the fidelity
of a balanced needle to a magnetic stone, all else in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) being
motionless.

<p/>The courses of the Victory were absorbed into the main, then her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) topsails
went, and then her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) top-gallants. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was now no more than a dead fly's
wing on a sheet of spider's web; and even this fragment diminished. Anne
could hardly bear to see the end, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) resolved not to flinch. The
admiral's flag sank behind the watery line, and in a minute the very
truck of the last topmast stole away. The Victory was gone.

<p/>Anne's lip quivered as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) murmured, without removing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wet eyes from
the vacant and solemn horizon, '<div class="bookquote">``They that go down to the sea in ships,
that do business in great waters--'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``These see the works of the Lord, and His (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) wonders in the deep,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>' was
returned by a man's voice from behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/>Looking round quickly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw a soldier standing there; and the grave
eyes of John Loveday bent on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis what I was thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, trying to be composed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were saying it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) answered gently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was I?--I did not know it... How came you here?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) presently
added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been behind you a good while; but you never turned round.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was deeply occupied,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said in an undertone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--I too came to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) pass. I heard this morning that Lord Nelson
had embarked, and I knew at once that they would sail immediately. The
Victory and Euryalus are to join the rest of the fleet at Plymouth. There
was a great crowd of people assembled to see the admiral off; they
cheered him (<font color='blue'><b>admiral</b></font>) and the ship as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) dropped down. He (<font color='blue'><b>admiral</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>admiral</b></font>) coffin on
board with him (<font color='blue'><b>admiral</b></font>), they say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>admiral</b></font>) coffin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, turning deadly pale. <div class="bookquote">``Something terrible, then,
is meant by that! O, why _would_ Bob go in that ship? doomed to
destruction from the very beginning like this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) determination to sail under Captain Hardy, and under no one
else,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John. <div class="bookquote">``There may be hot work; but we must hope for the
best.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And observing how wretched she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) looked, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``But won't you
let me help you back? If you can walk as far as Hope Cove it will be
enough. A lerret is going from there across the bay homeward to the
harbour in the course of an hour; it belongs to a man I know, and they
can take one passenger, I am sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) back upon the Channel, and by his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) help soon reached the
place indicated. The boat was lying there as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found it
to belong to the old man who had been with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) at the Bill, and was in
charge of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) two younger sons. The trumpet-major helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) into it
over the slippery blocks of stone, one of the young men spread his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jacket
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to sit on, and as soon as they pulled from shore John climbed up
the blue-grey cliff, and disappeared over the top, to return to the
mainland by road.

<p/>Anne was in the town by three o'clock. The trip in the stern of the
lerret had quite refreshed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), with the help of the biscuits, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
had at last been able to eat. The van from the port to Overcombe did not
start till four o'clock, and feeling no further interest in the gaieties
of the place, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) strolled on past the King's house to the outskirts, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
mind settling down again upon the possibly sad fate of the Victory when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found herself alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not hurry on; and finding that even now
there wanted another half-hour to the carrier's time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) turned into a
little lane to escape the inspection of the numerous passers-by. Here
all was quite lonely and still, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sat down under a willow-tree,
absently regarding the landscape, which had begun to put on the rich
tones of declining summer, but which to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was as hollow and faded as a
theatre by day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could hold out no longer; burying her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wept without restraint.

<p/>Some yards behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was a little spring of water, having a stone margin
round it to prevent the cattle from treading in the sides and filling it
up with dirt. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wept, two elderly gentlemen entered unperceived
upon the scene, and walked on to the spring's brink. Here they paused
and looked in, afterwards moving round it, and then stooping as if to
smell or taste its waters. The spring was, in fact, a sulphurous one,
then recently discovered by a physician who lived in the neighbourhood;
and it was beginning to attract some attention, having by common report
contributed to effect such wonderful cures as almost passed belief. After
a considerable discussion, apparently on how the pool might be improved
for better use, one of the two elderly gentlemen turned away, leaving the
other still probing the spring with his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) cane. The first stranger, who
wore a blue coat with gilt buttons, came on in the direction of Anne
Garland, and seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) sad posture went quickly up to her (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>), and said
abruptly, <div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne, who in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) grief had observed nothing of the gentlemen's presence,
withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) handkerchief from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes and started to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) feet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
instantly recognised her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) interrogator as the King.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, what, crying?''  (<font color='red'><b>Majesty</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) Majesty inquired kindly. <div class="bookquote">``How is this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--have seen a dear friend go away, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) faltered, with downcast
eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--partings are sad--very sad--for us all. You must hope your friend
will return soon. Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) or she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) gone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, your Majesty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't know--how is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) is a sailor on board the Victory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) has reason to be proud,''  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>said the King with interest. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) is
your brother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne tried to explain what he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was, but could not, and blushed with
painful heat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, well; what is his (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>In spite of Anne's confusion and low spirits, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) womanly shrewdness told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) at once that no harm could be done by revealing Bob's name; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
answered, <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) name is Robert Loveday, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Loveday--a good name. I shall not forget it. Now dry your cheeks, and
don't cry any more. Loveday--Robert Loveday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne curtseyed, the King smiled good-humouredly, and turned to rejoin his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
companion, who was afterwards heard to be Dr. --, the physician in
attendance at Gloucester Lodge. This gentleman had in the meantime
filled a small phial with the medicinal water, which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) carefully placed
in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pocket; and on the King coming up they retired together and
disappeared. Thereupon Anne, now thoroughly aroused, followed the same
way with a gingerly tread, just in time to see them get into a carriage
which was in waiting at the turning of the lane.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) quite forgot the carrier, and everything else in connexion with
riding home. Flying along the road rapidly and unconsciously, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
awoke to a sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) whereabouts she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was so near to Overcombe as to
make the carrier not worth waiting for. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been borne up in this
hasty spurt at the end of a weary day by visions of Bob promoted to the
rank of admiral, or something equally wonderful, by the King's special
command, the chief result of the promotion being, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) arrangement of
the piece, that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) would stay at home and go to sea no more. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was
not a girl who indulged in extravagant fancies long, and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
reached home she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thought that the King had probably forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) by that
time, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) troubles, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lover's name.




<p/>XXXV. A SAILOR ENTERS


<p/>The remaining fortnight of the month of September passed away, with a
general decline from the summer's excitements. The royal family left the
watering-place the first week in October, the German Legion with their
artillery about the same time. The dragoons still remained at the
barracks just out of the town, and John Loveday brought to Anne every
newspaper that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) could lay hands on, especially such as contained any
fragment of shipping news. This threw them much together; and at these
times John was often awkward and confused, on account of the unwonted
stress of concealing his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) great love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) interests had grandly developed from the limits of Overcombe and the
town life hard by, to an extensiveness truly European. During the whole
month of October, however, not a single grain of information reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>),
or anybody else, concerning Nelson and his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) blockading squadron off Cadiz.
There were the customary bad jokes about Buonaparte, especially when it
was found that the whole French army had turned its back upon Boulogne
and set out for the Rhine. Then came accounts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) march through
Germany and into Austria; but not a word about the Victory.

<p/>At the beginning of autumn John brought news which fearfully depressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). The Austrian General Mack had capitulated with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mack</b></font>) whole army. Then
were revived the old misgivings as to invasion. <div class="bookquote">``Instead of having to
cope with him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) weary with waiting, we shall have to encounter This Man
fresh from the fields of victory,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>ran the newspaper article.

<p/>But the week which had led off with such a dreary piping was to end in
another key. On the very day when Mack's army was piling arms at the
feet of its conqueror, a blow had been struck by Bob Loveday and his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
comrades which eternally shattered the enemy's force by sea. Four days
after the receipt of the Austrian news Corporal Tullidge ran into the
miller's house to inform him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) that on the previous Monday, at eleven in
the morning, the Pickle schooner, Lieutenant Lapenotiere, had arrived at
Falmouth with despatches from the fleet; that the stage-coaches on the
highway through Wessex to London were chalked with the words <div class="bookquote">``Great
Victory!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wessex</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Glorious Triumph!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and so on; and that all the country people
were wild to know particulars.

<p/>On Friday afternoon John arrived with authentic news of the battle off
Cape Trafalgar, and the death of Nelson. Captain Hardy was alive, though
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>) escape had been narrow enough, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>) shoe-buckle having been carried
away by a shot. It was feared that the Victory had been the scene of the
heaviest slaughter among all the ships engaged, but as yet no returns of
killed and wounded had been issued, beyond a rough list of the numbers in
some of the ships.

<p/>The suspense of the little household in Overcombe Mill was great in the
extreme. John came thither daily for more than a week; but no further
particulars reached England till the end of that time, and then only the
meagre intelligence that there had been a gale immediately after the
battle, and that many of the prizes had been lost. Anne said little to
all these things, and preserved a superstratum of calmness on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
countenance; but some inner voice seemed to whisper to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) that Bob was
no more. Miller Loveday drove to Pos`ham several times to learn if the
Captain's sisters had received any more definite tidings than these
flying reports; but that family had heard nothing which could in any way
relieve the miller's anxiety. When at last, at the end of November,
there appeared a final and revised list of killed and wounded as issued
by Admiral Collingwood, it was a useless sheet to the Lovedays. To their
great pain it contained no names but those of officers, the friends of
ordinary seamen and marines being in those good old days left to discover
their losses as best they might.

<p/>Anne's conviction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) loss increased with the darkening of the early
winter time. Bob was not a cautious man who would avoid needless
exposure, and a hundred and fifty of the Victory's crew had been disabled
or slain. Anybody who had looked into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) room at this time would have
seen that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) favourite reading was the office for the Burial of the Dead
at Sea, beginning <div class="bookquote">``We therefore commit his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) body to the deep.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anybody</b></font>)</div>In these
first days of December several of the victorious fleet came into port;
but not the Victory. Many supposed that that noble ship, disabled by the
battle, had gone to the bottom in the subsequent tempestuous weather; and
the belief was persevered in till it was told in the town and port that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been seen passing up the Channel. Two days later the Victory
arrived at Portsmouth.

<p/>Then letters from survivors began to appear in the public prints which
John so regularly brought to Anne; but though he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) watched the mails with
unceasing vigilance there was never a letter from Bob. It sometimes
crossed John's mind that his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) brother might still be alive and well, and
that in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wish to abide by his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) expressed intention of giving up Anne
and home life he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was deliberately lax in writing. If so, Bob was
carrying out the idea too thoughtlessly by half, as could be seen by
watching the effects of suspense upon the fair face of the victim, and
the anxiety of the rest of the family.

<p/>It was a clear day in December. The first slight snow of the season had
been sifted over the earth, and one side of the apple-tree branches in
the miller's garden was touched with white, though a few leaves were
still lingering on the tops of the younger trees. A short sailor of the
Royal Navy, who was not Bob, nor anything like him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), crossed the mill
court and came to the door. The miller hastened out and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) into
the room, where John, Mrs. Loveday, and Anne Garland were all present.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm from aboard the Victory,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sailor</b></font>)</div>said the sailor. <div class="bookquote">``My name's Jim Cornick.
And your lad is alive and well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div><p/>They breathed rather than spoke their thankfulness and relief, the
miller's eyes being moist as he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) turned aside to calm himself; while Anne,
having first jumped up wildly from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) seat, sank back again under the
almost insupportable joy that trembled through her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) limbs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) utmost
finger.

<p/>``I've come from Spithead to Pos``ham,<div class="bookquote">'' the sailor continued, `and now I am
going on to father at Budmouth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pos ham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!--I know your father,''  (<font color='red'><b>James</b></font>)</div>cried the trumpet-major, `old James Cornick.''

<p/>It was the man who had brought Anne in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lerret from Portland Bill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Bob hasn't got a scratch?''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a scratch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cornick/Jim Cornick/Jim</b></font>)</div>said Cornick.

<p/>Loveday then bustled off to draw the visitor something to drink. Anne
Garland, with a glowing blush on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face, had gone to the back part of
the room, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was the very embodiment of sweet content as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
slightly swayed herself without speaking. A little tide of happiness
seemed to ebb and flow through her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in listening to the sailor's words,
moving her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) figure with it. The seaman and John went on conversing.

<p/>``Bob had a good deal to do with barricading the hawse-holes afore we were
in action, and the Adm'l and Cap'n both were very much pleased at how
'twas done. When the Adm'l went up the quarter-deck ladder, Cap'n Hardy
said a word or two to Bob, but what it was I don't know, for I was
quartered at a gun some ways off. However, Bob saw the Adm'l stagger
when 'a was wownded, and was one of the men who carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) to the
cockpit. After that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) and some other lads jumped aboard the French
ship, and I believe they was in her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) struck her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) flag. What 'a
did next I can't say, for the wind had dropped, and the smoke was like a
cloud. But 'a got a good deal talked about; and they say there's
promotion in store for<div class="bookquote">``n.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cornick/Jim Cornick/Jim</b></font>)</div><p/>At this point in the story Jim Cornick stopped to drink, and a low
unconscious humming came from Anne in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) distant corner; the faint
melody continued more or less when the conversation between the sailor
and the Lovedays was renewed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We heard afore that the Victory was near knocked to pieces,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the
miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Knocked to pieces? You'd say so if so be you could see her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>)! Gad, her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>)
sides be battered like an old penny piece; the shot be still sticking in
her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) wales, and her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) sails be like so many clap-nets: we have run all the
way home under jury topmasts; and as for her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) decks, you may swab wi' hot
water, and you may swab wi' cold, but there's the blood-stains, and there
they'll bide... The Cap'n had a narrow escape, like many o' the
rest--a shot shaved his (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) ankle like a razor. You should have seen that
man's face in the het o' battle, his (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) features were as if they'd been cast
in steel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We rather expected a letter from Bob before this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cornick/Jim Cornick/Jim</b></font>)</div>said Jim Cornick, with a smile of toleration, `you must make
allowances. The truth o't is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cornick</b></font>)'s engaged just now at Portsmouth, like
a good many of the rest from our ship... <div class="bookquote">``Tis a very nice young
woman that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s a courting of, and I make no doubt that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll be an
excellent wife for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Loveday, in a warning tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Courting--wife?''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller.

<p/>They instinctively looked towards Anne. Anne had started as if shaken by
an invisible hand, and a thick mist of doubt seemed to obscure the
intelligence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes. This was but for two or three moments. Very
pale, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) arose and went right up to the seaman. John gently tried to
intercept her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) passed him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) by.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you speak of Robert Loveday as courting a wife?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) asked, without
the least betrayal of emotion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't see you, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cornick/Jim Cornick/Jim</b></font>)</div>replied Cornick, turning. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, your brother
hev' his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) eye on a wife, and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) deserves one. I hope you don't mind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, with a stage laugh. <div class="bookquote">``I am interested,
naturally. And what is she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``A very nice young master-baker's daughter, honey. A very wise choice of
the young man<div class="bookquote">``s.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) fair or dark?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hair is rather light.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like light hair; and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) name is Caroline. But can it be that my story hurts ye? If so--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John, interposing anxiously. <div class="bookquote">``We don't care for more
just at this moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We _do_ care for more!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne vehemently. <div class="bookquote">``Tell it all, sailor.
That is a very pretty name, Caroline. When are they going to be
married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know as how the day is settled,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cornick/Jim Cornick/Jim</b></font>)</div>answered Jim, even now scarcely
conscious of the devastation he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was causing in one fair breast. <div class="bookquote">``But
from the rate the courting is scudding along at, I should say it won't be
long first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you see him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) when you go back, give him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) my best wishes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lightly
said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) moved away. <div class="bookquote">``And,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) added, with solemn bitterness, `say
that I am glad to hear he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) is making such good use of the first days of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) escape from the Valley of the Shadow of Death!'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went away,
expressing indifference by audibly singing in the distance--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we go dance the round, the round, the round,
Shall we go dance the round?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your sister is lively at the news,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cornick/Jim Cornick/Jim</b></font>)</div>observed Jim Cornick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>murmured John gloomily, as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) gnawed his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) lower lip and kept his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
eyes fixed on the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>continued the man from the Victory, <div class="bookquote">``I won't say that your
brother's intended ha'n't got some ballast, which is very lucky for`n, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might have picked up with a girl without a single copper nail. To be
sure there was a time we had when we got into port! It was open house
for us all!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>And after mentally regarding the scene for a few seconds
Jim emptied his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) cup and rose to go.

<p/>The miller was saying some last words to him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) outside the house, Anne's
voice had hardly ceased singing upstairs, John was standing by the
fireplace, and Mrs. Loveday was crossing the room to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) daughter,
whose manner had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) some uneasiness, when a noise came from above
the ceiling, as of some heavy body falling. Mrs. Loveday rushed to the
staircase, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, I feared something!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Loveday</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) was followed by
John.

<p/>When they entered Anne's room, which they both did almost at one moment,
they found her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lying insensible upon the floor. The trumpet-major, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
lips tightly closed, lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) arms, and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) upon the bed;
after which he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) went back to the door to give room to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother, who was
bending over the girl with some hartshorn.

<p/>Presently Mrs. Loveday looked up and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is only in a
faint, John, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) colour is coming back. Now leave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to me; I will
be downstairs in a few minutes, and tell you how she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>John left the room. When he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) gained the lower apartment his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father was
standing by the chimney-piece, the sailor having gone. The trumpet-major
went up to the fire, and, grasping the edge of the high chimney-shelf,
stood silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I hear a noise when I went out?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked the elder, in a tone of
misgiving.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you did,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John. <div class="bookquote">``It was she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), but her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother says she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is
better now. Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) added impetuously, <div class="bookquote">``Bob is a worthless
blockhead! If there had been any good in him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) would have been drowned
years ago!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``John, John--not too fast,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller. <div class="bookquote">``That's a hard thing to say
of your brother, and you ought to be ashamed of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) tries me more than I can bear. Good God! what can a man be
made of to go on as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does? Why didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) come home; or if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't
get leave why didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) write? <div class="bookquote">``Tis scandalous of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to serve a woman
like that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gently, gently. The chap hev done his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) duty as a sailor; and though
there might have been something between him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) and Anne, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother, in
talking it over with me, has said many times that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) couldn't think of
their marrying till Bob had settled down in business with me. Folks that
gain victories must have a little liberty allowed 'em. Look at the
Admiral himself, for that matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div><p/>John continued looking at the red coals, till hearing Mrs. Loveday's foot
on the staircase, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) went to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) is better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Loveday; `but she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) won't come down again to-
day.''

<p/>Could John have heard what the poor girl was moaning to herself at that
moment as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lay writhing on the bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would have doubted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother's
assurance. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) had been dead I could have borne it, but this I cannot
bear!''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>XXXVI. DERRIMAN SEES CHANCES


<p/>Meanwhile Sailor Cornick had gone on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cornick</b></font>) way as far as the forking roads,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Cornick</b></font>) met Festus Derriman on foot. The latter, attracted by the
seaman's dress, and by seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Cornick</b></font>) come from the mill, at once accosted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cornick</b></font>). Jim, with the greatest readiness, fell into conversation, and told
the same story as that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had related at the mill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bob Loveday going to be married?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeated Festus.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You all seem struck of a heap wi' that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I never heard news that pleased me more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cornick/Jim Cornick/Jim</b></font>)</div><p/>When Cornick was gone, Festus, instead of passing straight on, halted on
the little bridge and meditated. Bob, being now interested elsewhere,
would probably not resent the siege of Anne's heart by another; there
could, at any rate, be no further possibility of that looming duel which
had troubled the yeoman's mind ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) horse-play on Anne at the
house on the down. To march into the mill and propose to Mrs. Loveday
for Anne before John's interest could revive in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was, to this hero's
thinking, excellent discretion.

<p/>The day had already begun to darken when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) entered, and the cheerful
fire shone red upon the floor and walls. Mrs. Loveday received him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
alone, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to take a seat by the chimney-corner, a little of
the old hankering for him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) as a son-in-law having permanently remained
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your servant, Mrs. Loveday,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, `and I will tell you at once what
I come for. You will say that I take time by the forelock when I inform
you that it is to push on my long-wished-for alliance wi' your daughter,
as I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is now a free woman again.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Mr. Derriman,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother placably. <div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) is ill at
present. I'll mention it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) is better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) to alter her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) cruel, cruel resolves against me, on the score
of--of my consuming passion for her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>). In short,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>continued Festus,
dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) parlour language in his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) warmth, <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell thee what, Dame
Loveday, I want the maid, and must have her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Loveday replied that that was very plain speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, `tis. But Bob has given her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) never meant to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>).
I'll tell you, Mrs. Loveday, what I have never told a soul before. I was
standing upon Budmouth Quay on that very day in last September that Bob
set sail, and I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) say to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) brother John that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) gave your
daughter up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it was very unmannerly of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) to trifle with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Loveday warmly. <div class="bookquote">``Who did he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) give her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) up to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div><p/>Festus replied with hesitation, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) up to John.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To John? How could he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) give her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) up to a man already over head and ears
in love with that actress woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O? You surprise me. Which actress is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That Miss Johnson. Anne tells me that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hopelessly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div><p/>Festus arose. Miss Johnson seemed suddenly to acquire high value as a
sweetheart at this announcement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) had himself felt a nameless
attractiveness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>), and John had done likewise. John crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) path
in all possible ways.

<p/>Before the yeoman had replied somebody opened the door, and the firelight
shone upon the uniform of the person they discussed. Festus nodded on
recognizing him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>), wished Mrs. Loveday good evening, and went out
precipitately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So Bob told you he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) meant to break off with my Anne when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) went away?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Loveday</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Loveday remarked to the trumpet-major. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I had known of it
before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div><p/>John appeared disturbed at the sudden charge. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) murmured that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could
not deny it, and then hastily turned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) and followed Derriman, whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) saw before him (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) on the bridge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Derriman!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) shouted.

<p/>Festus started and looked round. <div class="bookquote">``Well, trumpet-major,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) said blandly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When will you have sense enough to mind your own business, and not come
here telling things you have heard by sneaking behind people's backs?''
 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>demanded John hotly. <div class="bookquote">``If you can't learn in any other way, I shall have
to pull your ears again, as I did the other day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'_You_ pull my ears? How can you tell that lie, when you know 'twas
somebody else pulled <div class="bookquote">``em?''

 (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no, no. I pulled your ears, and thrashed you in a mild way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll swear to it? Surely 'twas another man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was in the parlour at the public-house; you were almost in the dark.''
 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>And John added a few details as to the particular blows, which amounted
to proof itself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I heartily ask your pardon for saying 'twas a lie!''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>cried Festus,
advancing with extended hand and a genial smile. <div class="bookquote">``Sure, if I had known
_'twas_ you, I wouldn't have insulted you by denying it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was why you didn't challenge me, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was it! I wouldn't for the world have hurt your nice sense of
honour by letting `ee go unchallenged, if I had known! And now, you see,
unfortunately I can't mend the mistake. So long a time has passed since
it happened that the heat of my temper is gone off. I couldn't oblige
`ee, try how I might, for I am not a man, trumpet-major, that can butcher
in cold blood--no, not I, nor you neither, from what I know of `ee. So,
willy-nilly, we must fain let it pass, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John, smiling grimly. <div class="bookquote">``Who did you think I
was, then, that night when I boxed you all round?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, don't press me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the yeoman</b></font>)</div>replied the yeoman. <div class="bookquote">``I can't reveal; it would be
disgracing myself to show how very wide of the truth the mockery of wine
was able to lead my senses. We will let it be buried in eternal mixens
of forgetfulness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As you wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the trumpet-major loftily. <div class="bookquote">``But if you ever _should_
think you knew it was me, why, you know where to find me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>And Loveday
walked away.

<p/>The instant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) was gone Festus shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) fist at the evening star,
which happened to lie in the same direction as that taken by the dragoon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now for my revenge! Duels? Lifelong disgrace to me if ever I fight
with a man of blood below my own! There are other remedies for upper-
class souls!... Matilda--that's my way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div><p/>Festus strode along till he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) reached the Hall, where Cripplestraw appeared
gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>) from under the arch of the porter's lodge. Derriman dashed
open the entrance-hurdle with such violence that the whole row of them
fell flat in the mud.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mercy, Maister Festus!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cripplestraw/Anthony Cripplestraw/Anthony</b></font>)</div>said Cripplestraw. '<div class="bookquote">``Surely,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I says to myself
when I see ye a-coming, <div class="bookquote">``surely Maister Festus is fuming like that
because there's no chance of the enemy coming this year after all.'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cr-r-ripplestraw! I have been wounded to the heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>replied Derriman,
with a lurid brow.

<p/>``And the man yet lives, and you wants yer horse-pistols instantly?
Certainly, Maister F--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Cripplestraw, not my pistols, but my new-cut clothes, my heavy gold
seals, my silver-topped cane, and my buckles that cost more money than he (<font color='blue'><b>Cripplestraw</b></font>)
ever saw! Yes, I must tell somebody, and I'll tell you, because there's
no other fool near. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) heart and soul. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'s poor; she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s tip-
top genteel, and not rich. I am rich, by comparison. I'll court the
pretty play-actress, and win her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) before his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Play-actress, Maister Derriman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) this very day, met her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) by accident, and spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s still in the town--perhaps because of him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>). I can meet her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) at any
hour of the day-- But I don't mean to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>); not I. I will court
her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) for my pastime, and to annoy him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>). It will be all the more death to
him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) that I don't want her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). Then perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) will say to me, ``You have
taken my one ewe lamb<div class="bookquote">''--meaning that I am the king, and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)'s the poor
man, as in the church verse; and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)'ll beg for mercy when `tis too
late--unless, meanwhile, I shall have tired of my new toy. Saddle the
horse, Cripplestraw, to-morrow at ten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div><p/>Full of this resolve to scourge John Loveday to the quick through his (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
passion for Miss Johnson, Festus came out booted and spurred at the time
appointed, and set off on his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) morning ride.

<p/>Miss Johnson's theatrical engagement having long ago terminated, she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>)
would have left the Royal watering-place with the rest of the visitors
had not matrimonial hopes detained her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) there. These had nothing whatever
to do with John Loveday, as may be imagined, but with a stout, staid boat-
builder in Cove Row by the quay, who had shown much interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>)
impersonations. Unfortunately this substantial man had not been quite so
attentive since the end of the season as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) previous manner led her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) to
expect; and it was a great pleasure to the lady to see Mr. Derriman
leaning over the harbour bridge with his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) eyes fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) came
towards it after a stroll past her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) elderly wooer's house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Od take it, ma'am, you didn't tell me when I saw you last that the
tooting man with the blue jacket and lace was yours devoted?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>began
Festus.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Matilda</b></font>)</div>In Matilda's ever-changing emotional interests, John
Loveday was a stale and unprofitable personality.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, that trumpet-major man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O! What of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Come; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loves you, and you know it, ma<div class="bookquote">``am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) knew, at any rate, how to take the current when it served. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>)
glanced at Festus, folded her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) lips meaningly, and nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've come to cut him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) head, it being unsafe to speak till she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) knew a little more
of the subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus, reddening, `do you mean to say that you think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>)
seriously--you, who might look so much higher?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Constant dropping will wear away a stone; and you should only hear his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
pleading! His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) handsome face is impressive, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manners are--O, so
genteel! I am not rich; I am, in short, a poor lady of decayed family,
who has nothing to boast of but my blood and ancestors, and they won't
find a body in food and clothing!--I hold the world but as the world,
Derrimanio--a stage where every man must play a part, and mine a sad
one!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) eyes thoughtfully and sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will talk of this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus, much affected. <div class="bookquote">``Let us walk to the
Look-out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) made no objection, and said, as they turned that way, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Derriman,
a long time ago I found something belonging to you; but I have never yet
remembered to return it.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) drew from her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) bosom the paper which
Anne had dropped in the meadow when eluding the grasp of Festus on that
summer day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Zounds, I smell fresh meat!''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>cried Festus when he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) had looked it over.
''`Tis in my uncle's writing, and `tis what I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) singing on the day
the French didn't come, and afterwards saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) marking in the road. <div class="bookquote">``Tis
something he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>)'s got hid away. Give me the paper, there's a dear; `tis
worth sterling gold!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Halves, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Matilda/Miss Johnson/Matilda Johnson</b></font>)</div>said Matilda tenderly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gad, yes--anything!''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>replied Festus, blazing into a smile, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) had
looked up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) best new manner at the possibility that he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) might be
worth the winning. They went up the steps to the summit of the cliff,
and dwindled over it against the sky.




<p/>XXXVII. REACTION


<p/>There was no letter from Bob, though December had passed, and the new
year was two weeks old. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) movements were, however, pretty accurately
registered in the papers, which John still brought, but which Anne no
longer read. During the second week in December the Victory sailed for
Sheerness, and on the 9th of the following January the public funeral of
Lord Nelson took place in St. Paul's.

<p/>Then there came a meagre line addressed to the family in general. Bob's
new Portsmouth attachment was not mentioned, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) told them he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had been
one of the eight-and-forty seamen who walked two-and-two in the funeral
procession, and that Captain Hardy had borne the banner of emblems on the
same occasion. The crew was soon to be paid off at Chatham, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>)
thought of returning to Portsmouth for a few days to see a valued friend.
After that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>) should come home.

<p/>But the spring advanced without bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>), and John watched Anne
Garland's desolation with augmenting desire to do something towards
consoling her (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>). The old feelings, so religiously held in check, were
stimulated to rebelliousness, though they did not show themselves in any
direct manner as yet.

<p/>The miller, in the meantime, who seldom interfered in such matters, was
observed to look meaningly at Anne and the trumpet-major from day to day;
and by-and-by he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) spoke privately to John.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) words were short and to the point: Anne was very melancholy; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had
thought too much of Bob. Now 'twas plain that they had lost him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) for many
years to come. Well; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had always felt that of the two he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) would rather
John married her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Now John might settle down there, and succeed where
Bob had failed. <div class="bookquote">``So if you could get her (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>), my sonny, to think less of him (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>)
and more of thyself, it would be a good thing for all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div><p/>An inward excitement had risen in John; but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) suppressed it and said
firmly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fairness to Bob before everything!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) hev forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>), and there's an end on<div class="bookquote">``t.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>)'s not forgot him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well; think it over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/>This discourse was the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) penning a letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
begged for a distinct statement whether, as John at first supposed, Bob's
verbal renunciation of Anne on the quay had been only a momentary
ebullition of friendship, which it would be cruel to take literally; or
whether, as seemed now, it had passed from a hasty resolve to a standing
purpose, persevered in for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) own pleasure, with not a care for the
result on poor Anne.

<p/>John waited anxiously for the answer, but no answer came; and the silence
seemed even more significant than a letter of assurance could have been
of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) absolution from further support to a claim which Bob himself had
so clearly renounced. Thus it happened that paternal pressure, brotherly
indifference, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) own released impulse operated in one delightful
direction, and the trumpet-major once more approached Anne as in the old
time.

<p/>But it was not till she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been left to herself for a full five months,
and the blue-bells and ragged-robins of the following year were again
making themselves common to the rambling eye, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) directly addressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was tying up a group of tall flowering plants in the garden:
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not turn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had subsided
into a placid dignity which enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) when watched to perform any
little action with seeming composure--very different from the flutter of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) inexperienced days.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you never going to turn round?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) at length asked good-humouredly.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) then did turn, and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) for a moment without speaking; a
certain suspicion looming in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes, as if suggested by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) perceptible
want of ease.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How like summer it is getting to feel, is it not?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said.

<p/>John admitted that it was getting to feel like summer: and, bending his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
gaze upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) with an earnestness which no longer left any doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
subject, went on to ask--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you ever in these last weeks thought of how it used to be between
us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) replied quickly, <div class="bookquote">``O, John, you shouldn't begin that again. I am
almost another woman now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's all the more reason why I should, isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne looked thoughtfully to the other end of the garden, faintly shaking
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head; <div class="bookquote">``I don't quite see it like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You feel yourself quite free, don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'_Quite_ free!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said instantly, and with proud distinctness; her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes
fell, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) repeated more slowly, ``Quite free.'' Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thoughts
seemed to fly from herself to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But you are not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Johnson!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O--that woman! You know as well as I that was all make-up, and that I
never for a moment thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had an idea you were acting; but I wasn't sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's nothing now. Anne, I want to relieve your life; to cheer
you in some way; to make some amends for my brother's bad conduct. If
you cannot love me, liking will be well enough. I have thought over
every side of it so many times--for months have I been thinking it
over--and I am at last sure that I do right to put it to you in this way.
That I don't wrong Bob I am quite convinced. As far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) is concerned
we be both free. Had I not been sure of that I would never have spoken.
Father wants me to take on the mill, and it will please him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) if you can
give me one little hope; it will make the house go on altogether better
if you can think o' me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are generous and good, John,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, as a big round tear bowled
helter-skelter down her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face and hat-strings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not that; I fear I am quite the opposite,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, without looking
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It would be all gain to me-- But you have not answered my
question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``John, I cannot!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, with a cheerless smile.
<div class="bookquote">``Positively I cannot. Will you make me a promise?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want you to promise first-- Yes, it is dreadfully unreasonable,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
added, in a mild distress. <div class="bookquote">``But do promise!''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div><p/>John by this time seemed to have a feeling that it was all up with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
for the present. <div class="bookquote">``I promise,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said listlessly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is that you won't speak to me about this for _ever_ so long,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
returned, with emphatic kindliness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) replied; `very good. Dear Anne, you don't think I have
been unmanly or unfair in starting this anew?''

<p/>Anne looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) face without a smile. <div class="bookquote">``You have been perfectly
natural,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``And so I think have I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div><p/>John, mournfully: <div class="bookquote">``You will not avoid me for this, or be afraid of me? I
will not break my word. I will not worry you any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, John. You need not have said worry; it isn't that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am very blind and stupid. I have been hurting your heart all
the time without knowing it. It is my fate, I suppose. Men who love
women the very best always blunder and give more pain than those who love
them less.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne laid one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hands on the other as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) softly replied, looking
down at them, <div class="bookquote">``No one loves me as well as you, John; nobody in the world
is so worthy to be loved; and yet I cannot anyhow love you rightly.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And
lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes, <div class="bookquote">``But I do so feel for you that I will try as hard as I
can to think about you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that is something,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``You say I must not speak
about it again for ever so long; how long?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now that's not fair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>Anne retorted, going down the garden, and leaving
him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) alone.

<p/>About a week passed. Then one afternoon the miller walked up to Anne
indoors, a weighty topic being expressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) tread.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was so glad, my honey,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) began, with a knowing smile, `to see that
from the mill-window last week.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) flung a nod in the direction of the
garden.

<p/>Anne innocently inquired what it could be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jack and you in the garden together,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) continued laying his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) hand
gently on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) shoulder and stroking it. <div class="bookquote">``It would so please me, my dear
little girl, if you could get to like him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) better than that weathercock,
Master Bob.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head; not in forcible negation, but to imply a kind of
neutrality.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you? Come now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) threw back her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head with a little laugh of grievance. <div class="bookquote">``How you all
beset me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) expostulated. ``It makes me feel very wicked in not
obeying you, and being faithful--faithful to--' But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could not trust
that side of the subject to words. <div class="bookquote">``Why would it please you so much?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``John is as steady and staunch a fellow as ever blowed a trumpet. I've
always thought you might do better with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) than with Bob. Now I've a
plan for taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) into the mill, and letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) have a comfortable
time o't after his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) long knocking about; but so much depends upon you that
I must bide a bit till I see what your pleasure is about the poor fellow.
Mind, my dear, I don't want to force ye; I only just ask ye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne meditatively regarded the miller from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) shady eyelids, the
fingers of one hand playing a silent tattoo on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) bosom. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know
what to say to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) answered brusquely, and went away.

<p/>But these discourses were not without their effect upon the extremely
conscientious mind of Anne. They were, moreover, much helped by an
incident which took place one evening in the autumn of this year, when
John came to tea. Anne was sitting on a low stool in front of the fire,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hands clasped across her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knee. John Loveday had just seated himself
on a chair close behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and Mrs. Loveday was in the act of filling
the teapot from the kettle which hung in the chimney exactly above Anne.
The kettle slipped forward suddenly, whereupon John jumped from the chair
and put his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own two hands over Anne's just in time to shield them, and
the precious knee she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) clasped, from the jet of scalding water which had
directed itself upon that point. The accidental overflow was instantly
checked by Mrs. Loveday; but what had come was received by the devoted
trumpet-major on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hands.

<p/>Anne, who had hardly been aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), started up like a
person awakened from a trance. <div class="bookquote">``What have you done to yourself, poor
John, to keep it off me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) cried, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hands.

<p/>John reddened emotionally at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) words, <div class="bookquote">``It is a bit of a scald, that's
all,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) replied, drawing a finger across the back of one hand, and
bringing off the skin by the touch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are scalded painfully, and I not at all!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) gazed into his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) kind
face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had never gazed there before, and when Mrs. Loveday came back
with oil and other liniments for the wound Anne would let nobody dress it
but herself. It seemed as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) coyness had all gone, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had
done all that lay in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) power she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) still sat by him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). At his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) departure
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had never said to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) life before: <div class="bookquote">``Come again
soon!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>In short, that impulsive act of devotion, the last of a series of the
same tenor, had been the added drop which finally turned the wheel.
John's character deeply impressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) determined steadfastness to
his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) lode star won her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) admiration, the more especially as that star was
herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) began to wonder more and more how she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could have so
persistently held out against his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) advances before Bob came home to renew
girlish memories which had by that time got considerably weakened. Could
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) not, after all, please the miller, and try to listen to John? By so
doing she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would make a worthy man happy, the only sacrifice being at
worst that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) unworthy self, whose future was no longer valuable. <div class="bookquote">``As
for Bob, the woman is to be pitied who loves him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) reflected
indignantly, and persuaded herself that, whoever the woman might be, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was not Anne Garland.

<p/>After this there was something of recklessness and something of
pleasantry in the young girl's manner of making herself an example of the
triumph of pride and common sense over memory and sentiment. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
attitude had been epitomized in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) defiant singing at the time she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
learnt that Bob was not leal and true. John, as was inevitable, came
again almost immediately, drawn thither by the sun of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) first smile on
him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), and the words which had accompanied it. And now instead of going
off to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) little pursuits upstairs, downstairs, across the room, in the
corner, or to any place except where he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) happened to be, as had been her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
custom hitherto, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) remained seated near him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), returning interesting
answers to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) general remarks, and at every opportunity letting him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) know
that at last he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had found favour in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>The day was fine, and they went out of doors, where Anne endeavoured to
seat herself on the sloping stone of the window-sill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How good you have become lately,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John, standing over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and
smiling in the sunlight which blazed against the wall. <div class="bookquote">``I fancy you have
stayed at home this afternoon on my account.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said gaily--

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Do whatever we may for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), dame, we cannot do too much!
For he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s one that has guarded our land.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) has done more than that: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) has saved me from a dreadful
scalding. The back of your hand will not be well for a long time, John,
will it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hand to regard its condition, and the next natural thing
was to take hers. There was a glow upon his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) face when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did it: his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
star was at last on a fair way towards the zenith after its long and
weary declination. The least penetrating eye could have perceived that
Anne had resolved to let him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) woo, possibly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) temerity to let him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
win. Whatever silent sorrow might be locked up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), it was by this
time thrust a long way down from the light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want you to go somewhere with me if you will,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, still holding
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes? Where is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) pointed to a distant hill-side which, hitherto green, had within the
last few days begun to show scratches of white on its face. <div class="bookquote">``Up there,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see little figures of men moving about. What are they doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cutting out a huge picture of the king on horseback in the earth of the
hill. The king's head is to be as big as our mill-pond and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) body as
big as this garden; he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) and the horse will cover more than an acre. When
shall we go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whenever you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``John!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Loveday</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Loveday from the front door. <div class="bookquote">``Here's a friend come
for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div><p/>John went round, and found his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) trusty lieutenant, Trumpeter Buck, waiting
for him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). A letter had come to the barracks for John in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) absence, and
the trumpeter, who was going for a walk, had brought it along with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).
Buck then entered the mill to discuss, if possible, a mug of last year's
mead with the miller; and John proceeded to read his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) letter, Anne being
still round the corner where he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had read a few
words he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) turned as pale as a sheet, but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did not move, and perused the
writing to the end.

<p/>Afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) elbow against the wall, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) palm to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
head, thinking with painful intentness. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) took himself vigorously
in hand, as it were, and gradually became natural again. When he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) parted
from Anne to go home with Buck she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) noticed nothing different in him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>).

<p/>In barracks that evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) read the letter again. It was from Bob; and
the agitating contents were these:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``DEAR JOHN,--I have drifted off from writing till the present time
because I have not been clear about my feelings; but I have discovered
them at last, and can say beyond doubt that I mean to be faithful to
my dearest Anne after all. The fact is, John, I've got into a bit of
a scrape, and I've a secret to tell you about it -LRB-which must go no
further on any account-RRB-. On landing last autumn I fell in with a
young woman, and we got rather warm as folks do; in short, we liked
one another well enough for a while. But I have got into shoal water
with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and have found her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to be a terrible take-in. Nothing in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
at all--no sense, no niceness, all tantrums and empty noise, John,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seemed monstrous clever at first. So my heart comes back
to its old anchorage. I hope my return to faithfulness will make no
difference to you. But as you showed by your looks at our parting
that you should not accept my offer to give her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) up--made in too much
haste, as I have since found--I feel that you won't mind that I have
returned to the path of honour. I dare not write to Anne as yet, and
please do not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) know a word about the other young woman, or
there will be the devil to pay. I shall come home and make all things
right, please God. In the meantime I should take it as a kindness,
John, if you would keep a brotherly eye upon Anne, and guide her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mind
back to me. I shall die of sorrow if anybody sets her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) against me, for
my hopes are getting bound up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) again quite strong. Hoping you
are jovial, as times go, I am,--Your affectionate brother,

<p/>ROBERT.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>When the cold daylight fell upon John's face, as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) dressed himself next
morning, the incipient yesterday's wrinkle in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) forehead had become
permanently graven there. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had resolved, for the sake of that only
brother whom he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had nursed as a baby, instructed as a child, and
protected and loved always, to pause in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) procedure for the present,
and at least do nothing to hinder Bob's restoration to favour, if a
genuine, even though temporarily smothered, love for Anne should still
hold possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>). But having arranged to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to see the
excavated figure of the king, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) started for Overcombe during the day, as
if nothing had occurred to check the smooth course of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) love.




<p/>XXXVIII. A DELICATE SITUATION


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am ready to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) arrived.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) paused as if taken aback by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) readiness, and replied with much
uncertainty, <div class="bookquote">``Would it--wouldn't it be better to put it off till there is
less sun?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>The very slightest symptom of surprise arose in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) rejoined, <div class="bookquote">``But
the weather may change; or had we better not go at all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no!--it was only a thought. We will start at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div><p/>And along the vale they went, John keeping himself about a yard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
right hand. When the third field had been crossed they came upon half-a-
dozen little boys at play.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) clasp her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) side, like a man?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the biggest and
rudest boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) clasp her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) side, like a man?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>echoed all the rude
smaller boys in a chorus.

<p/>The trumpet-major turned, and, after some running, succeeded in smacking
two of them with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) switch, returning to Anne breathless. <div class="bookquote">``I am ashamed
they should have insulted you so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, blushing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They said no harm, poor boys,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) replied reproachfully.

<p/>Poor John was dumb with perception. The gentle hint upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would
have eagerly spoken only one short day ago was now like fire to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
wound.

<p/>They presently came to some stepping-stones across a brook. John crossed
first without turning his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) head, and Anne, just lifting the skirt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
dress, crossed behind him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). When they had reached the other side a
village girl and a young shepherd approached the brink to cross. Anne
stopped and watched them. The shepherd took a hand of the young girl in
each of his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) own, and walked backward over the stones, facing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and
keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) upright by his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) grasp, both of them laughing as they went.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you staying for, Miss Garland?''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>asked John.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was only thinking how happy they are,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said quietly; and
withdrawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes from the tender pair, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) turned and followed him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>),
not knowing that the seeming sound of a passing bumble-bee was a
suppressed groan from John.

<p/>When they reached the hill they found forty navvies at work removing the
dark sod so as to lay bare the chalk beneath. The equestrian figure that
their shovels were forming was scarcely intelligible to John and Anne now
they were close, and after pacing from the horse's head down his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) breast
to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hoof, back by way of the king's bridle-arm, past the bridge of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
nose, and into his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) cocked-hat, Anne said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had had enough of it,
and stepped out of the chalk clearing upon the grass. The trumpet-major
had remained all the time in a melancholy attitude within the rowel of
his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) Majesty's right spur.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My shoes are caked with chalk,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said as they walked downwards again;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) drew back her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) dress to look at them. <div class="bookquote">``How can I get some of it
cleared off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you was to wipe them in the long grass there,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John, pointing to
a spot where the blades were rank and dense, `some of it would come off.''
Having said this, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) walked on with religious firmness.

<p/>Anne raked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) little feet on the right side, on the left side, over the
toe, and behind the heel; but the tenacious chalk held its own. Panting
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) exertion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) gave it up, and at length overtook him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope it is right now?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, looking gingerly over his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I wanted some assistance--some one to steady
me. It is so hard to stand on one foot and wipe the other without
support. I was in danger of toppling over, and so gave it up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Merciful stars, what an opportunity!''  (<font color='red'><b>the fellow</b></font>)</div>thought the poor fellow while she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to offer help. But his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) lips remained closed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went
on with a pouting smile--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem in such a hurry! Why are you in such a hurry? After all the
fine things you have said about--about caring so much for me, and all
that, you won't stop for anything!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was too much for John. ``Upon my heart and life, my dea--' he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) began.
Here Bob's letter crackled warningly in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) waistcoat pocket as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) laid
his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hand asseveratingly upon his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) breast, and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) became suddenly scaled up
to dumbness and gloom as before.

<p/>When they reached home Anne sank upon a stool outside the door, fatigued
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) excursion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) first act was to try to pull off her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) shoe--it
was a difficult matter; but John stood beating with his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) switch the leaves
of the creeper on the wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother--David--Molly, or somebody--do come and help me pull off these
dirty shoes!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) cried aloud at last. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody helps me in anything!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John, coming towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) with incredible slowness
and an air of unutterable depression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, I can do without _you_. David is best,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) returned, as the old man
approached and removed the obnoxious shoes in a trice.

<p/>Anne was amazed at this sudden change from devotion to crass
indifference. On entering her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) room she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) flew to the glass, almost
expecting to learn that some extraordinary change had come over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
pretty countenance, rendering her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) intolerable for evermore. But it was,
if anything, fresher than usual, on account of the exercise. <div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
said retrospectively. For the first time since their acqaintance she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had
this week encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and for the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had shown that
encouragement was useless. <div class="bookquote">``But perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) does not clearly understand,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) added serenely.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) next came it was, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) surprise, to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) newspapers, now
for some time discontinued. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw them she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I do not
care for newspapers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The shipping news is very full and long to-day, though the print is
rather small.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I take no further interest in the shipping news,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) replied with cold
dignity.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was sitting by the window, inside the table, and hence when, in spite
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) negations, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deliberately unfolded the paper and began to read
about the Royal Navy she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could hardly rise and go away. With a stoical
mien he (<font color='blue'><b>Navy</b></font>) read on to the end of the report, bringing out the name of Bob's
ship with tremendous force.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``I'll hear no more! Let me read to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The trumpet-major sat down. Anne turned to the military news, delivering
every detail with much apparent enthusiasm. <div class="bookquote">``That's the subject _I_
like!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said fervently.

<p/>``But--but Bob is in the navy now, and will most likely rise to be an
officer. And then--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is there like the army?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) interrupted. <div class="bookquote">``There is no smartness
about sailors. They waddle like ducks, and they only fight stupid
battles that no one can form any idea of. There is no science nor
stratagem in sea-fights--nothing more than what you see when two rams run
their heads together in a field to knock each other down. But in
military battles there is such art, and such splendour, and the men are
so smart, particularly the horse-soldiers. O, I shall never forget what
gallant men you all seemed when you came and pitched your tents on the
downs! I like the cavalry better than anything I know; and the dragoons
the best of the cavalry--and the trumpeters the best of the dragoons!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, if it had but come a little sooner!''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>moaned John within him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
replied as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could regain self-command, ``I am glad Bob is in the
navy at last--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) is so much more fitted for that than the
merchant-service--so brave by nature, ready for any daring deed. I have
heard ever so much more about his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) doings on board the Victory. Captain
Hardy took special notice that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>)--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to know anything more about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne impatiently; `of
course sailors fight; there's nothing else to do in a ship, since you
can't run away! You may as well fight and be killed as be killed not
fighting.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Still it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>) character to be careless of himself where the honour of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>) country is concerned,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>John pleaded. <div class="bookquote">``If you had only known him (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>) as a
boy you would own it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>) would always risk his (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>) own life to save anybody
else's. Once when a cottage was afire up the lane he (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>) rushed in for a
baby, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>) was only a boy himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>) had the narrowest
escape. We have got his (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>) hat now with the hole burnt in it. Shall I get
it and show it to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I don't wish it. It has nothing to do with me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
persisted in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) course towards the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Ah! you are leaving
because I am in your way. You want to be alone while you read the
paper--I will go at once. I did not see that I was interrupting you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) rose as if to retreat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no! I would rather be interrupted by _you_ than--O, Miss Garland,
excuse me! I'll just speak to father in the mill, now I am here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>It is scarcely necessary to state that Anne -LRB-whose unquestionable
gentility amid somewhat homely surroundings has been many times insisted
on in the course of this history-RRB- was usually the reverse of a woman with
a coming-on disposition; but, whether from pique at his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) manner, or from
wilful adherence to a course rashly resolved on, or from coquettish
maliciousness in reaction from long depression, or from any other
thing,--so it was that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Trumpet-major,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, recalling him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) replied timidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The bow of my cap-ribbon has come untied, has it not?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned and
fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bewitching glance upon him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).

<p/>The bow was just over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) forehead, or, more precisely, at the point
where the organ of comparison merges in that of benevolence, according to
the phrenological theory of Gall. John, thus brought to, endeavoured to
look at the bow in a skimming, duck-and-drake fashion, so as to avoid
dipping his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own glance as far as to the plane of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) interrogator's eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``It is untied,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, drawing back a little.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came nearer, and asked, <div class="bookquote">``Will you tie it for me, please?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>As there was no help for it, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) nerved himself and assented. As her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head
only reached to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) fourth button she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) necessarily looked up for his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
convenience, and John began fumbling at the bow. Try as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would it was
impossible to touch the ribbon without getting his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) finger tips mixed with
the curls of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) forehead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your hand shakes--ah! you have been walking fast,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you almost done it?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) inquiringly directed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gaze upward
through his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--not yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) faltered in a warm sweat of emotion, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) heart going
like a flail.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then be quick, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes, I will, Miss Garland! B-B-Bob is a very good fel--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not that man's name to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) interrupted.

<p/>John was silent instantly, and nothing was to be heard but the rustling
of the ribbon; till his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hands once more blundered among the curls, and
then touched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) forehead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O good God!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>ejaculated the trumpet-major in a whisper, turning away
hastily to the corner-cupboard, and resting his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) face upon his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter, John?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't do it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tie your cap-ribbon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you are so--Because I am clumsy, and never could tie a bow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are clumsy indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>answered Anne, and went away.

<p/>After this she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt injured, for it seemed to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) rated her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
happiness as of meaner value than Bob's; since he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had persisted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
idea of giving Bob another chance when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had implied that it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
wish to do otherwise. Could Miss Johnson have anything to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
firmness? An opportunity of testing him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) in this direction occurred some
days later. She (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) had been up the village, and met John at the mill-door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you heard the news? Matilda Johnson is going to be married to
young Derriman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) back to the sun, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) faced her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) features
were searchingly exhibited. There was no change whatever in them, unless
it were that a certain light of interest kindled by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) question turned
to complete and blank indifference. <div class="bookquote">``Well, as times go, it is not a bad
match for her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, with a phlegm which was hardly that of a lover.

<p/>John on his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) part was beginning to find these temptations almost more than
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could bear. But being quartered so near to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father's house it was
unnatural not to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), especially when at any moment the regiment
might be ordered abroad, and a separation of years ensue; and as long as
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) went there he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could not help seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/>The year changed from green to gold, and from gold to grey, but little
change came over the house of Loveday. During the last twelve months Bob
had been occasionally heard of as upholding his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) country's honour in
Denmark, the West Indies, Gibraltar, Malta, and other places about the
globe, till the family received a short letter stating that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had
arrived again at Portsmouth. At Portsmouth Bob seemed disposed to
remain, for though some time elapsed without further intelligence, the
gallant seaman never appeared at Overcombe. Then on a sudden John learnt
that Bob's long-talked-of promotion for signal services rendered was to
be an accomplished fact. The trumpet-major at once walked off to
Overcombe, and reached the village in the early afternoon. Not one of
the family was in the house at the moment, and John strolled onwards over
the hill towards Casterbridge, without much thought of direction till,
lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) beheld Anne Garland wandering about with a little
basket upon her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) arm.

<p/>At first John blushed with delight at the sweet vision; but, recalled by
his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) conscience, the blush of delight was at once mangled and slain. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
looked for a means of retreat. But the field was open, and a soldier was
a conspicuous object: there was no escaping her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was kind of you to come,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, with an inviting smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was quite by accident,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) answered, with an indifferent laugh. <div class="bookquote">``I
thought you was at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne blushed and said nothing, and they rambled on together. In the
middle of the field rose a fragment of stone wall in the form of a gable,
known as Faringdon Ruin; and when they had reached it John paused and
politely asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) were not a little tired with walking so far. No
particular reply was returned by the young lady, but they both stopped,
and Anne seated herself on a stone, which had fallen from the ruin to the
ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A church once stood here,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>observed John in a matter-of-fact tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have often shaped it out in my mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``Here where
I sit must have been the altar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True; this standing bit of wall was the chancel end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne had been adding up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) little studies of the trumpet-major's
character, and was surprised to find how the brightness of that character
increased in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes with each examination. A kindly and gentle
sensation was again aroused in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Here was a neglected heroic man,
who, loving her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to distraction, deliberately doomed himself to pensive
shade to avoid even the appearance of standing in a brother's way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If the altar stood here, hundreds of people have been made man and wife
just there, in past times,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, with calm deliberateness, throwing
a little stone on a spot about a yard westward.

<p/>John annihilated another tender burst and replied, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, this field used
to be a village. My grandfather could call to mind when there were
houses here. But the squire pulled 'em down, because poor folk were an
eyesore to him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, John, what you once asked me to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) continued, not
accepting the digression, and turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In what sort of way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the matter of my future life, and yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I am afraid I don<div class="bookquote">``t.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``John Loveday!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) back upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) for a moment, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) might not see his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
face. <div class="bookquote">``Ah--I do remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said at last, in a dry, small, repressed
voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--need I say more? Isn't it sufficient?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be sufficient,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>answered the unhappy man. ``But--'

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>folk</b></font>) looked up with a reproachful smile, and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>folk</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``That
summer,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went on, `you asked me ten times if you asked me once. I am
older now; much more of a woman, you know; and my opinion is changed
about some people; especially about one.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O Anne, Anne!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) burst out as, racked between honour and desire, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
snatched up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand. The next moment it fell heavily to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lap. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had absolutely relinquished it half-way to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been thinking lately,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, with preternaturally sudden
calmness, `that men of the military profession ought not to m--ought to
be like St. Paul, I mean.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fie, John; pretending religion!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said sternly. <div class="bookquote">``It isn't that at
all. _It's Bob_!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the miserable trumpet-major. <div class="bookquote">``I have had a letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
to-day.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pulled out a sheet of paper from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) breast. <div class="bookquote">``That's it!
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s promoted--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s a lieutenant, and appointed to a sloop that only
cruises on our own coast, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'ll be at home on leave half his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
time--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'ll be a gentleman some day, and worthy of you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) threw the letter into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lap, and drew back to the other side of the
gable-wall. Anne jumped up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) seat, flung away the letter without
looking at it, and went hastily on. John did not attempt to overtake
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Picking up the letter, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) followed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wake at a distance of a
hundred yards.

<p/>But, though Anne had withdrawn from his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) presence thus precipitately, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
never thought more highly of him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) life than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did five minutes
afterwards, when the excitement of the moment had passed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw it all
quite clearly; and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) self-sacrifice impressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) so much that the
effect was just the reverse of what he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had been aiming to produce. The
more he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) pleaded for Bob, the more her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) perverse generosity pleaded for
John. To-day the crisis had come--with what results she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had not
foreseen.

<p/>As soon as the trumpet-major reached the nearest pen-and-ink he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) flung
himself into a seat and wrote wildly to Bob:--

<p/>``DEAR ROBERT,--I write these few lines to let you know that if you
want Anne Garland you must come at once--you must come instantly, and
post-haste--_or she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>) will be gone_! Somebody else wants her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>)
wants him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)! It is your last chance, in the opinion of--

<p/>``Your faithful brother and well-wisher,
``JOHN.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``P.S.--Glad to hear of your promotion. Tell me the day and I'll meet
the coach.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>XXXIX. BOB LOVEDAY STRUTS UP AND DOWN


<p/>One night, about a week later, two men were walking in the dark along the
turnpike road towards Overcombe, one of them with a bag in his (<font color='blue'><b>LOVEDAY</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the taller of the two, the squareness of whose shoulders
signified that he (<font color='blue'><b>LOVEDAY</b></font>) wore epaulettes, `now you must do the best you can for
yourself, Bob. I have done all I can; but th`hast thy work cut out, I
can tell thee.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't have run such a risk for the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other, in a
tone of ingenuous contrition. <div class="bookquote">``But thou`st see, Jack, I didn't think
there was any danger, knowing you was taking care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Garland</b></font>), and keeping my
place warm for me. I didn't hurry myself, that's true; but, thinks I, if
I get this promotion I am promised I shall naturally have leave, and then
I'll go and see 'em all. Gad, I shouldn't have been here now but for
your letter!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You little think what risks you've run,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) brother. <div class="bookquote">``However,
try to make up for lost time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right. And whatever you do, Jack, don't say a word about this other
girl. Hang the girl!--I was a great fool, I know; still, it is over now,
and I am come to my senses. I suppose Anne never caught a capful of wind
from that quarter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knows all about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>said John seriously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Knows? By George, then, I'm ruined!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob, standing stock-still in
the road as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) meant to remain there all night.

<p/>``That's what I meant by saying it would be a hard battle for <div class="bookquote">``ee,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>returned John, with the same quietness as before.

<p/>Bob sighed and moved on. <div class="bookquote">``I don't deserve that woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) cried
passionately, thumping his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) three upper ribs with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) fist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've thought as much myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>observed John, with a dryness which was
almost bitter. <div class="bookquote">``But it depends on how thou`st behave in future.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``John,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) brother's hand, <div class="bookquote">``I'll be a new man. I
solemnly swear by that eternal milestone staring at me there that I'll
never look at another woman with the thought of marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whilst that
darling is free--no, not if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) be a mermaiden of light! It's a lucky
thing that I'm slipped in on the quarterdeck! it may help me with
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--hey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It may with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother; I don't think it will make much difference with
Anne. Still, it is a good thing; and I hope that some day you'll command
a big ship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Officers are scarce; but I'm afraid my luck won't
carry me so far as that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ever tell you that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mentioned your name to the King?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The seaman</b></font>)</div><p/>The seaman stood still again. <div class="bookquote">``Never!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``How did such a thing
as that happen, in Heaven's name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div><p/>John described in detail, and they walked on, lost in conjecture.

<p/>As soon as they entered the house the returned officer of the navy was
welcomed with acclamation by his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) father and David, with mild approval by
Mrs. Loveday, and by Anne not at all--that discreet maiden having
carefully retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own room some time earlier in the evening. Bob
did not dare to ask for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in any positive manner; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) just inquired
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) health, and that was all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what's the matter with thy face, my son?''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller, staring.
<div class="bookquote">``David, show a light here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>And a candle was thrust against Bob's cheek,
where there appeared a jagged streak like the geological remains of a
lobster.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O--that's where that rascally Frenchman's grenade busted and hit me from
the Redoubtable, you know, as I told `ee in my letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a word!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, didn't I tell `ee? Ah, no; I meant to, but I forgot it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And here's a sort of dint in yer forehead too; what do that mean, my
dear boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) finger in a chasm in Bob's skull.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was done in the Indies. Yes, that was rather a troublesome chop--a
cutlass did it. I should have told `ee, but I found `twould make my
letter so long that I put it off, and put it off; and at last thought it
wasn't worth while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div><p/>John soon rose to take his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) departure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all up with me and her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) outside the door.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'s not even going to see me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait a little,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the trumpet-major. It was easy enough on the night
of the arrival, in the midst of excitement, when blood was warm, for Anne
to be resolute in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) avoidance of Bob Loveday. But in the morning
determination is apt to grow invertebrate; rules of pugnacity are less
easily acted up to, and a feeling of live and let live takes possession
of the gentle soul. Anne had not meant even to sit down to the same
breakfast-table with Bob; but when the rest were assembled, and had got
some way through the substantial repast which was served at this hour in
the miller's house, Anne entered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) came silently as a phantom, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
eyes cast down, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) cheeks pale. It was a good long walk from the door
to the table, and Bob made a full inspection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) came up to a
chair at the remotest corner, in the direct rays of the morning light,
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) dumbly sat herself down.

<p/>It was altogether different from how she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had expected. Here was she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), who
had done nothing, feeling all the embarrassment; and Bob, who had done
the wrong, feeling apparently quite at ease.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll speak to Bob, won't you, honey?''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller after a silence.
To meet Bob like this after an absence seemed irregular in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) wish me to,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) replied, so addressing the miller that no part,
scrap, or outlying beam whatever of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) glance passed near the subject of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) remark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s a lieutenant, you know, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother on the same side;
`and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s been dreadfully wounded.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, turning a little towards the false one; at which Bob
felt it to be time for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) to put in a spoke for himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said contritely; `and how do you do?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) extended his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) to take hers, but only to the
extent of a niggardly inch or so. At the same moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) glanced up at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), when their eyes met, and hers were again withdrawn.

<p/>The hitch between the two younger members of the household tended to make
the breakfast a dull one. Bob was so depressed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) unforgiving manner
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) could not throw that sparkle into his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) stories which their
substance naturally required; and when the meal was over, and they went
about their different businesses, the pair resembled the two Dromios in
seldom or never being, thanks to Anne's subtle contrivances, both in the
same room at the same time.

<p/>This kind of performance repeated itself during several days. At last,
after dogging her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hither and thither, leaning with a wrinkled forehead
against doorposts, taking an oblique view into the room where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
happened to be, picking up worsted balls and getting no thanks, placing a
splinter from the Victory, several bullets from the Redoubtable, a strip
of the flag, and other interesting relics, carefully labelled, upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
table, and hearing no more about them than if they had been pebbles from
the nearest brook, he (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) hit upon a new plan. To avoid him (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) frequently
sat upstairs in a window overlooking the garden. Lieutenant Loveday
carefully dressed himself in a new uniform, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had caused to be
sent some days before, to dazzle admiring friends, but which he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had never
as yet put on in public or mentioned to a soul. When arrayed he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) entered
the sunny garden, and there walked slowly up and down as he (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) had seen
Nelson and Captain Hardy do on the quarter-deck; but keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) right
shoulder, on which his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) one epaulette was fixed, as much towards Anne's
window as possible.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) made no sign, though there was not the least question that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>). At the end of half-an-hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) went in, took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) clothes,
and gave himself up to doubt and the best tobacco.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) repeated the programme on the next afternoon, and on the next, never
saying a word within doors about his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) doings or his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) notice.

<p/>Meanwhile the results in Anne's chamber were not uninteresting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had
been looking out on the first day, and was duly amazed to see a naval
officer in full uniform promenading in the path. Finding it to be Bob,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) left the window with a sense that the scene was not for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>); then,
from mere curiosity, peeped out from behind the curtain. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was a
pretty spectacle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) admitted, relieved as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) figure was by a dense
mass of sunny, close-trimmed hedge, over which nasturtiums climbed in
wild luxuriance; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could care for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) one bit, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
couldn't, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) form would have been a delightful study, surpassing in
interest even its splendour on the memorable day of their visit to the
town theatre. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother; Mrs. Loveday came promptly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, it is nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne indifferently; `only that Bob has got his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
uniform.''

<p/>Mrs. Loveday peeped out, and raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) hands with delight. <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) has
not said a word to us about it! What a lovely epaulette! I must call
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed. As I take no interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) I shall not let people come
into my room to admire him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you called me,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was because I thought you liked fine clothes. It is what I don't
care for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Notwithstanding this assertion she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) again looked out at Bob the next
afternoon when his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) footsteps rustled on the gravel, and studied his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
appearance under all the varying angles of the sunlight, as if fine
clothes and uniforms were not altogether a matter of indifference. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
certainly was a splendid, gentlemanly, and gallant sailor from end to end
of him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>); but then, what were a dashing presentment, a naval rank, and
telling scars, if a man was fickle-hearted? However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) peeped on till
the fourth day, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) did not peep. The window was open, she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
looked right out, and Bob knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had got a rise to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) bait at
last. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) hat to her (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>), keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) right shoulder forwards,
and said, <div class="bookquote">``Good-day, Miss Garland,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>with a smile.

<p/>Anne replied, <div class="bookquote">``Good-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>with funereal seriousness; and the acquaintance
thus revived led to the interchange of a few words at supper-time, at
which Mrs. Loveday nodded with satisfaction. But Anne took especial care
that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) should never meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) alone, and to insure this her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ingenuity was
in constant exercise. There were so many nooks and windings on the
miller's rambling premises that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could never be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) would not turn
up within a foot of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), particularly as his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) thin shoes were almost
noiseless.

<p/>One fine afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) accompanied Molly in search of elderberries for
making the family wine which was drunk by Mrs. Loveday, Anne, and anybody
who could not stand the rougher and stronger liquors provided by the
miller. After walking rather a long distance over the down they came to
a grassy hollow, where elder-bushes in knots of twos and threes rose from
an uneven bank and hung their heads towards the south, black and heavy
with bunches of fruit. The charm of fruit-gathering to girls is enhanced
in the case of elderberries by the inoffensive softness of the leaves,
boughs, and bark, which makes getting into the branches easy and pleasant
to the most indifferent climbers. Anne and Molly had soon gathered a
basketful, and sending the servant home with it, Anne remained in the
bush picking and throwing down bunch by bunch upon the grass. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was so
absorbed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) occupation of pulling the twigs towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and the
rustling of their leaves so filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ears, that it was a great surprise
when, on turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) perceived a similar movement to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own
among the boughs of the adjoining bush.

<p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thought they were disturbed by being partly in contact with
the boughs of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) bush; but in a moment Robert Loveday's face peered from
them, at a distance of about a yard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own. Anne uttered a little
indignant <div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>recovered herself, and went on plucking. Bob thereupon
went on plucking likewise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am picking elderberries for your mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lieutenant</b></font>)</div>said the lieutenant at last,
humbly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So I see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I happen to have come to the next bush to yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I see; but not the reason why.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne was now in the westernmost branches of the bush, and Bob had leant
across into the eastern branches of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>). In gathering he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) swayed towards
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), back again, forward again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said, when a further swing than usual had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
almost in contact with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why do you do it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The wind rocks the bough, and the bough rocks me.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) expressed by a
look her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) opinion of this statement in the face of the gentlest breeze;
and Bob pursued: <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid the berries will stain your pretty hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wear gloves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that's a plan I should never have thought of. Can I help you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are offended: that's what that means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then will you shake hands?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne hesitated; then slowly stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) took at
once. <div class="bookquote">``That will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, finding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) did not relinquish it
immediately. But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) still held it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) pulled, the effect of which
was to draw Bob's swaying person, bough and all, towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and herself
towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid to let go your hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>officer</b></font>)</div>said that officer, `for if I do your
spar will fly back, and you will be thrown upon the deck with great
violence.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you to let me go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) accordingly did, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) flew back, but did not by any means fall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It reminds me of the times when I used to be aloft clinging to a yard
not much bigger than this tree-stem, in the mid-Atlantic, and thinking
about you. I could see you in my fancy as plain as I see you now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me, or some other woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>retorted Anne haughtily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>declared Bob, shaking the bush for emphasis, <div class="bookquote">``I'll protest that I
did not think of anybody but you all the time we were dropping down
channel, all the time we were off Cadiz, all the time through battles and
bombardments. I seemed to see you in the smoke, and, thinks I, if I go
to Davy's locker, what will she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>bush</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't think that when you landed after Trafalgar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lieutenant</b></font>)</div>said the lieutenant in a reasoning tone; `that was a curious
thing. You'll hardly believe it, maybe; but when a man is away from the
woman he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loves best in the port--world, I mean--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can have a sort of
temporary feeling for another without disturbing the old one, which flows
along under the same as ever.''

<p/>``I can't believe it, and won<div class="bookquote">``t,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly</b></font>)</div>said Anne firmly.

<p/>Molly now appeared with the empty basket, and when it had been filled
from the heap on the grass, Anne went home with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), bidding Loveday a
frigid adieu.

<p/>The same evening, when Bob was absent, the miller proposed that they
should all three go to an upper window of the house, to get a distant
view of some rockets and illuminations which were to be exhibited in the
town and harbour in honour of the King, who had returned this year as
usual. They accordingly went upstairs to an empty attic, placed chairs
against the window, and put out the light; Anne sitting in the middle,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother close by, and the miller behind, smoking. No sign of any
pyrotechnic display was visible over the port as yet, and Mrs. Loveday
passed the time by talking to the miller, who replied in monosyllables.
While this was going on Anne fancied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heard some one approach,
and presently felt sure that Bob was drawing near her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in the surrounding
darkness; but as the other two had noticed nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said not a word.

<p/>All at once the swarthy expanse of southward sky was broken by the blaze
of several rockets simultaneously ascending from different ships in the
roads. At the very same moment a warm mysterious hand slipped round her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
own, and gave it a gentle squeeze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, with a sudden start away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How nervous you are, child, to be startled by fireworks so far off,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Loveday.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw rockets before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>murmured Anne, recovering from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
surprise.

<p/>Mrs. Loveday presently spoke again. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder what has become of Bob?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne did not reply, being much exercised in trying to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand away
from the one that imprisoned it; and whatever the miller thought he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) kept
to himself, because it disturbed his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) smoking to speak.

<p/>Another batch of rockets went up. <div class="bookquote">``O I never!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, in a
half-suppressed tone, springing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) chair. A second hand had with the
rise of the rockets leapt round her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) waist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor girl, you certainly must have change of scene at this rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Loveday</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Loveday.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I must,''  (<font color='red'><b>the daughter</b></font>)</div>murmured the dutiful daughter.

<p/>For some minutes nothing further occurred to disturb Anne's serenity.
Then a slow, quiet `a-hem' came from the obscurity of the apartment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, Bob? How long have you been there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Loveday</b></font>)</div>inquired Mrs. Loveday.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not long,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lieutenant</b></font>)</div>said the lieutenant coolly. <div class="bookquote">``I heard you were all here, and
crept up quietly, not to disturb ye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you wear heels to your shoes like Christian people, and not
creep about so like a cat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it keeps your floors clean to go slip-shod.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Meanwhile Anne was gently but firmly trying to pull Bob's arm from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
waist, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) distressful difficulty being that in freeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) waist she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
enslaved her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand, and in getting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand free she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) enslaved her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) waist.
Finding the struggle a futile one, owing to the invisibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
antagonist, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wish to keep its nature secret from the other two,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) arose, and saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not care to see any more, felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) way
downstairs. Bob followed, leaving Loveday and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) wife to themselves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) began, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had got down, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in the candle-
light of the large room. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) adroitly passed out at the other door,
at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) took a candle and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to the small room. <div class="bookquote">``Dear
Anne, do let me speak,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) repeated, as soon as the rays revealed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
figure. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) passed into the bakehouse before he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) could say more;
whereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) perseveringly did the same. Looking round for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) here he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
perceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) at the end of the room, where there were no means of exit
whatever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) began again, setting down the candle, `you must try to
forgive me; really you must. I love you the best of anybody in the wide,
wide world. Try to forgive me; come!'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) imploringly took her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand.

<p/>Anne's bosom began to surge and fall like a small tide, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes
remaining fixed upon the floor; till, when Loveday ventured to draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
slightly towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) burst out crying. ``I don't like you, Bob; I
don``t!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) suddenly exclaimed between her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sobs. <div class="bookquote">``I did once, but I
don't now--I can't, I can't; you have been very cruel to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
violently turned away, weeping.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have, I have been terribly bad, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>answered Bob,
conscience-stricken by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) grief. <div class="bookquote">``But--if you could only forgive me--I
promise that I'll never do anything to grieve `ee again. Do you forgive
me, Anne?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne's only reply was crying and shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's make it up. Come, say we have made it up, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand, and still keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes buried in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
handkerchief, said <div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, then!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Bob, with sudden determination. <div class="bookquote">``Now I know
my doom! And whatever you hear of as happening to me, mind this, you
cruel girl, that it is all your causing!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Saying this he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) strode with a
hasty tread across the room into the passage and out at the door,
slamming it loudly behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>).

<p/>Anne suddenly looked up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) handkerchief, and stared with round wet
eyes and parted lips at the door by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had gone. Having remained
with suspended breath in this attitude for a few seconds she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) turned
round, bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head upon the table, and burst out weeping anew with
thrice the violence of the former time. It really seemed now as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
grief would overwhelm her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), all the emotions which had been suppressed,
bottled up, and concealed since Bob's return having made themselves a
sluice at last.

<p/>But such things have their end; and left to herself in the large, vacant,
old apartment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) grew quieter, and at last calm. At length she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) took
the candle and ascended to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) bedroom, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) bathed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes and
looked in the glass to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had made herself a dreadful object. It
was not so bad as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had expected, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went downstairs again.

<p/>Nobody was there, and, sitting down, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wondered what Bob had really
meant by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) words. It was too dreadful to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) intended to go
straight away to sea without seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) again, and frightened at what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
had done she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) waited anxiously for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) return.




<p/>XL. A CALL ON BUSINESS


<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) suspense was interrupted by a very gentle tapping at the door, and
then the rustle of a hand over its surface, as if searching for the latch
in the dark. The door opened a few inches, and the alabaster face of
Uncle Benjy appeared in the slit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, Squire Derriman, you frighten me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All alone?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) asked in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother and Mr. Loveday are somewhere about the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) said, coming forward. <div class="bookquote">``I be wherrited out of my life,
and I have thought of you again--you yourself, dear Anne, and not the
miller. If you will only take this and lock it up for a few days till I
can find another good place for it--if you only would!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>)
breathlessly deposited the tin box on the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, obliged to dig it up from the cellar?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Ay; my nephew hath a scent of the place--how, I don't know! but he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) and a
young woman he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)'s met with are searching everywhere. I worked like a wire-
drawer to get it up and away while they were scraping in the next cellar.
Now where could ye put it, dear? <div class="bookquote">``Tis only a few documents, and my will,
and such like, you know. Poor soul o' me, I'm worn out with running and
fright!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll put it here till I can think of a better place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, lifting
the box. <div class="bookquote">``Dear me, how heavy it is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Benjy hastily; `the box is iron, you see. However,
take care of it, because I am going to make it worth your while. Ah, you
are a good girl, Anne. I wish you was mine!''

<p/>Anne looked at Uncle Benjy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had known for some time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
possessed all the affection he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) had to bestow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you wish that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said simply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now don't ye argue with me. Where d'ye put the coffer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, going to the window-seat, which rose as a flap,
disclosing a boxed receptacle beneath, as in many old houses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis very well for the present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) said dubiously, and they dropped the
coffer in, Anne locking down the seat, and giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) the key. <div class="bookquote">``Now I
don't want ye to be on my side for nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``I never did
now, did I? This is for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) a little packet of paper,
which Anne turned over and looked at curiously. <div class="bookquote">``I always meant to do
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>continued Uncle Benjy, gazing at the packet as it lay in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand,
and sighing. <div class="bookquote">``Come, open it, my dear; I always meant to do it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) opened it and found twenty new guineas snugly packed within.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, they are for you. I always meant to do it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) said, sighing
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you owe me nothing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>returned Anne, holding them out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>cried Uncle Benjy, covering his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Put 'em away...
Well, if you _don't_ want 'em--But put 'em away, dear Anne; they are
for you, because you have kept my counsel. Good-night t`ye. Yes, they
are for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) went a few steps, and turning back added anxiously, <div class="bookquote">``You won't spend
'em in clothes, or waste 'em in fairings, or ornaments of any kind, my
dear girl?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I wish you would have them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Benjy/Uncle Benjy</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Benjy, rushing off to escape their shine. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>)
had got no further than the passage when he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) returned again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you won't lend 'em to anybody, or put 'em into the bank--for no bank
is safe in these troublous times?... If I was you I'd keep them
_exactly_ as they be, and not spend 'em on any account. Shall I lock
them into my box for ye?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>); and the farmer rapidly unlocked the window-bench,
opened the box, and locked them in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis much the best plan,''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) said with great satisfaction as he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) returned
the keys to his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``There they will always be safe, you see, and
you won't be exposed to temptation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>When the old man had been gone a few minutes, the miller and his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) wife
came in, quite unconscious of all that had passed. Anne's anxiety about
Bob was again uppermost now, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) spoke but meagrely of old Derriman's
visit, and nothing of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) had left. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would fain have asked them
if they knew where Bob was, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not wish to inform them of
the rupture. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was forced to admit to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had somewhat
tried his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) patience, and that impulsive men had been known to do dark
things with themselves at such times.

<p/>They sat down to supper, the clock ticked rapidly on, and at length the
miller said, <div class="bookquote">``Bob is later than usual. Where can he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div><p/>As they both looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could no longer keep the secret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is my fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``I have driven him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) away! What shall I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The nature of the quarrel was at once guessed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) two elders said no
more. Anne rose and went to the front door, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) listened for every
sound with a palpitating heart. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went in; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went out: and
on one occasion she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heard the miller say, <div class="bookquote">``I wonder what hath passed
between Bob and Anne. I hope the chap will come home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Just about this time light footsteps were heard without, and Bob bounced
into the passage. Anne, who stood back in the dark while he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) passed,
followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) into the room, where her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother and the miller were on the
point of retiring to bed, candle in hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have kept ye up, I fear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>began Bob cheerily, and apparently without
the faintest recollection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) tragic exit from the house. ``But the
truth on't is, I met with Fess Derriman at the ``Duke of York'' as I went
from here, and there we have been playing Put ever since, not noticing
how the time was going. I haven't had a good chat with the fellow for
years and years, and really he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is an out and out good comrade--a regular
hearty! Poor fellow, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s been very badly used. I never heard the
rights of the story till now; but it seems that old uncle of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) treats
him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) shamefully. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) has been hiding away his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) money, so that poor Fess
might not have a farthing, till at last the young man has turned, like
any other worm, and is now determined to ferret out what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has done with
it. The poor young chap hadn't a farthing of ready money till I lent him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)
a couple of guineas--a thing I never did more willingly in my life. But
the man was very honourable. ``No; no,'' says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), ``don't let me deprive
ye.<div class="bookquote">'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s going to marry, and what may you think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is going to do it
for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For love, I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne's mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For money, I suppose, since he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s so short,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob, `for _spite_. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) has been badly served--deuced badly
served--by a woman. I never heard of a more heartless case in my life.
The poor chap wouldn't mention names, but it seems this young woman has
trifled with him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) in all manner of cruel ways--pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) into the river,
tried to steal his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) horse when he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was called out to defend his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) country--in
short, served him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) rascally. So I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) the two guineas and said, <div class="bookquote">``Now
let's drink to the hussy's downfall!'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, having approached behind him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>).

<p/>Bob turned and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and at the same moment Mr. and Mrs. Loveday
discreetly retired by the other door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it peace?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) asked tenderly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) anxiously replied. <div class="bookquote">``I--didn't mean to make you think I had
no heart.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>At this Bob inclined his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) countenance towards hers. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>)
said, smiling through two incipient tears as she (<font color='blue'><b>Loveday</b></font>) drew back. <div class="bookquote">``You are to
show good behaviour for six months, and you must promise not to frighten
me again by running off when I--show you how badly you have served me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am yours obedient--in anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>cried Bob. <div class="bookquote">``But am I pardoned?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Youth</b></font>)</div><p/>Youth is foolish; and does a woman often let her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reasoning in favour of
the worthier stand in the way of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) perverse desire for the less worthy
at such times as these? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) murmured some soft words, ending with <div class="bookquote">``Do
you repent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>It would be superfluous to transcribe Bob's answer.

<p/>Footsteps were heard without.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O begad; I forgot!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s waiting out there for a light.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My friend Derriman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Bob, I have to explain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div><p/>But Festus had by this time entered the lobby, and Anne, with a hasty
<div class="bookquote">``Get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) at once!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>vanished upstairs.

<p/>Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) waited and waited, but Festus did not seem inclined to depart;
and at last, foreboding some collision of interests from Bob's new
friendship for this man, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) crept into a storeroom which was over the
apartment into which Loveday and Festus had gone. By looking through a
knot-hole in the floor it was easy to command a view of the room beneath,
this being unceiled, with moulded beams and rafters.

<p/>Festus had sat down on the hollow window-bench, and was continuing the
statement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) wrongs. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) only knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was sitting upon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
thought apprehensively, `how easily he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) could tear up the flap, lock and
all, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) strong arm, and seize upon poor Uncle Benjy's possessions!''
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) did not appear to know, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) were acting, which was just
possible. After a while he (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) rose, and going to the table lifted the
candle to light his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) pipe. At the moment when the flame began diving into
the bowl the door noiselessly opened and a figure slipped across the room
to the window-bench, hastily unlocked it, withdrew the box, and beat a
retreat. Anne in a moment recognized the ghostly intruder as Festus
Derriman's uncle. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) could get out of the room Festus set down
the candle and turned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What--Uncle Benjy--haw, haw! Here at this time of night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>Uncle Benjy's eyes grew paralyzed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) mouth opened and shut like a
frog's in a drought, the action producing no sound.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have we got here--a tin box--the box of boxes? Why, I'll carry it
for `ee, uncle!--I am going home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``N-no-no, thanky, Festus: it is n-n-not heavy at all, thanky,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>gasped the
squireen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O but I must,''  (<font color='red'><b>Festus/Derriman/Mr. Derriman</b></font>)</div>said Festus, pulling at the box.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) have it, Bob!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>screamed the excited Anne through the hole
in the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, don't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>cried the uncle. <div class="bookquote">''`Tis a plot--there's a woman at
the window waiting to help him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne's eyes flew to the window, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw Matilda's face pressed
against the pane.

<p/>Bob, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) did not know whence Anne's command proceeded obeyed with
alacrity, pulled the box from the two relatives, and placed it on the
table beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, look here, hearties; what's the meaning o' this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s trying to rob me of all I possess!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the old man. <div class="bookquote">``My heart-
strings seem as if they were going crack, crack, crack!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div><p/>At this instant the miller in his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) shirt-sleeves entered the room, having
got thus far in his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) undressing when he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) heard the noise. Bob and Festus
turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) to explain; and when the latter had had his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) say Bob added,
``Well, all I know is that this box'--here he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) hand to
lay it upon the lid for emphasis. But as nothing but thin air met his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
fingers where the box had been, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) turned, and found that the box was
gone, Uncle Benjy having vanished also.

<p/>Festus, with an imprecation, hastened to the door, but though the night
was not dark Farmer Derriman and his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) burden were nowhere to be seen. On
the bridge Festus joined a shadowy female form, and they went along the
road together, followed for some distance by Bob, lest they should meet
with and harm the old man. But the precaution was unnecessary: nowhere
on the road was there any sign of Farmer Derriman, or of the box that
belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>). When Bob re-entered the house Anne and Mrs. Loveday had
joined the miller downstairs, and then for the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) learnt who
had been the heroine of Festus's lamentable story, with many other
particulars of that yeoman's history which he (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) had never before known. Bob
swore that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) would not speak to the traitor again, and the family
retired.

<p/>The escape of old Mr. Derriman from the annoyances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Derriman</b></font>) nephew not only
held good for that night, but for next day, and for ever. Just after
dawn on the following morning a labouring man, who was going to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work,
saw the old farmer and landowner leaning over a rail in a mead near his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)
house, apparently engaged in contemplating the water of a brook before
him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>). Drawing near, the man spoke, but Uncle Benjy did not reply. His (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>)
head was hanging strangely, his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) body being supported in its erect
position entirely by the rail that passed under each arm. On
after-examination it was found that Uncle Benjy's poor withered heart had
cracked and stopped its beating from damages inflicted on it by the
excitements of his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) life, and of the previous night in particular. The
unconscious carcass was little more than a light empty husk, dry and
fleshless as that of a dead heron found on a moor in January.

<p/>But the tin box was not discovered with or near him (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>). It was searched for
all the week, and all the month. The mill-pond was dragged, quarries
were examined, woods were threaded, rewards were offered; but in vain.

<p/>At length one day in the spring, when the mill-house was about to be
cleaned throughout, the chimney-board of Anne's bedroom, concealing a
yawning fire-place, had to be taken down. In the chasm behind it stood
the missing deed-box of Farmer Derriman.

<p/>Many were the conjectures as to how it had got there. Then Anne
remembered that on going to bed on the night of the collision between
Festus and his (<font color='blue'><b>Festus</b></font>) uncle in the room below, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had seen mud on the carpet of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) room, and the miller remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) had seen footprints on the
back staircase. The solution of the mystery seemed to be that the late
Uncle Benjy, instead of running off from the house with his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) box, had
doubled on getting out of the front door, entered at the back, deposited
his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) box in Anne's chamber where it was found, and then leisurely pursued
his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) way home at the heels of Festus, intending to tell Anne of his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) trick
the next day--an intention that was for ever frustrated by the stroke of
death.

<p/>Mr. Derriman's solicitor was a Casterbridge man, and Anne placed the box
in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands. Uncle Benjy's will was discovered within; and by this
testament Anne's queer old friend appointed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sole executrix of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
said will, and, more than that, gave and bequeathed to the same young
lady all his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) real and personal estate, with the solitary exception of
five small freehold houses in a back street in Budmouth, which were
devised to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) nephew Festus, as a sufficient property to maintain him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
decently, without affording any margin for extravagances. Oxwell Hall,
with its muddy quadrangle, archways, mullioned windows, cracked
battlements, and weed-grown garden, passed with the rest into the hands
of Anne.




<p/>XLI. JOHN MARCHES INTO THE NIGHT


<p/>During this exciting time John Loveday seldom or never appeared at the
mill. With the recall of Bob, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had been sole agent, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
mission seemed to be complete.

<p/>One mid-day, before Anne had made any change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) manner of living on
account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) unexpected acquisition, Lieutenant Bob came in rather
suddenly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had been to Budmouth, and announced to the arrested senses
of the family that the --th Dragoons were ordered to join Sir Arthur
Wellesley in the Peninsula.

<p/>These tidings produced a great impression on the household. John had
been so long in the neighbourhood, either at camp or in barracks, that
they had almost forgotten the possibility of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) being sent away; and
they now began to reflect upon the singular infrequency of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) calls
since his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) brother's return. There was not much time, however, for
reflection, if they wished to make the most of John's farewell visit,
which was to be paid the same evening, the departure of the regiment
being fixed for next day. A hurried valedictory supper was prepared
during the afternoon, and shortly afterwards John arrived.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) seemed to be more thoughtful and a trifle paler than of old, but
beyond these traces, which might have been due to the natural wear and
tear of time, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) showed no signs of gloom. On his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) way through the town
that morning a curious little incident had occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was
walking past one of the churches when a wedding-party came forth, the
bride and bridegroom being Matilda and Festus Derriman. At sight of the
trumpet-major the yeoman had glared triumphantly; Matilda, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) part,
had winked at him (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) slily, as much as to say--. But what she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) meant heaven
knows: the trumpet-major did not trouble himself to think, and passed on
without returning the mark of confidence with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) had favoured him (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>).

<p/>Soon after John's arrival at the mill several of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) friends dropped in
for the same purpose of bidding adieu. They were mostly the men who had
been entertained there on the occasion of the regiment's advent on the
down, when Anne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother were coaxed in to grace the party by their
superior presence; and their well-trained, gallant manners were such as
to make them interesting visitors now as at all times. For it was a
period when romance had not so greatly faded out of military life as it
has done in these days of short service, heterogeneous mixing, and
transient campaigns; when the esprit de corps was strong, and long
experience stamped noteworthy professional characteristics even on rank
and file; while the miller's visitors had the additional advantage of
being picked men.

<p/>They could not stay so long to-night as on that earlier and more cheerful
occasion, and the final adieus were spoken at an early hour. It was no
mere playing at departure, as when they had gone to Exonbury barracks,
and there was a warm and prolonged shaking of hands all round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll wish the poor fellows good-bye?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Loveday/Bob Loveday</b></font>)</div>said Bob to Anne, who had not
come forward for that purpose like the rest. <div class="bookquote">``They are going away, and
would like to have your good word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) then shyly advanced, and every man felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must make some pretty
speech as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) by the hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye! May you remember us as long as it makes ye happy, and forget
us as soon as it makes ye sad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergeant</b></font>)</div>said Sergeant Brett.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night! Health, wealth, and long life to ye!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergeant-major Wills</b></font>)</div>said Sergeant-major
Wills, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand from Brett.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I trust to meet ye again as the wife of a worthy man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Trumpeter Buck</b></font>)</div>said Trumpeter
Buck.

<p/>``We'll drink your health throughout the campaign, and so good-bye t<div class="bookquote">``ye,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Saddler-sergeant Jones, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) lips.

<p/>Three others followed with similar remarks, to each of which Anne
blushingly replied as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could, wishing them a prosperous
voyage, easy conquest, and a speedy return.

<p/>But, alas, for that! Battles and skirmishes, advances and retreats,
fevers and fatigues, told hard on Anne's gallant friends in the coming
time. Of the seven upon whom these wishes were bestowed, five, including
the trumpet-major, were dead men within the few following years, and
their bones left to moulder in the land of their campaigns.

<p/>John lingered behind. When the others were outside, expressing a final
farewell to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father, Bob, and Mrs. Loveday, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) came to Anne, who
remained within.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I thought you were going to look in again before leaving?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said
gently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I find I cannot. Good-bye!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``John,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div>said Anne, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) right hand in both hers, <div class="bookquote">``I must tell you
something. You were wise in not taking me at my word that day. I was
greatly mistaken about myself. Gratitude is not love, though I wanted to
make it so for the time. You don't call me thoughtless for what I did?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Loveday/JOHN</b></font>)</div>cried John, with more gaiety than truthfulness, `don't
let yourself be troubled! What happens is for the best. Soldiers love
here to-day and there to-morrow. Who knows that you won't hear of my
attentions to some Spanish maid before a month is gone by? <div class="bookquote">``Tis the way
of us, you know; a soldier's heart is not worth a week's purchase--ha,
ha! Goodbye, good-bye!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne/ANNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne felt the expediency of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) manner, received the affectation as real,
and smiled her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) reply, not knowing that the adieu was for evermore. Then
with a tear in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eye he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) went out of the door, where he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) bade farewell to
the miller, Mrs. Loveday, and Bob, who said at parting, <div class="bookquote">``It's all right,
Jack, my dear fellow. After a coaxing that would have been enough to win
three ordinary Englishwomen, five French, and ten Mulotters, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) has to-
day agreed to bestow her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand upon me at the end of six months. Good-bye,

permission and without paying copyright royalties. Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and

<p/>1.F.

<p/>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
<div class="bookquote">``Defects,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

<p/>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the <div class="bookquote">``Right
of Replacement or Refund''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and -LRB-c-RRB- any Defect you cause.


<p/>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

<p/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

<p/>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
-LRB-$1 to $5,000-RRB- are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

<p/>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

<p/>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

<p/>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<p/>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<p/>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

<p/>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hart</b></font>) produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

<p/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<p/>http://www.gutenberg.org

<p/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
