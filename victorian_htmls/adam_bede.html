The Workshop

<p/>With a single drop of ink for a mirror, the Egyptian
sorcerer undertakes to reveal to any chance comer farreaching visions of the past. This is what I undertake to
do for you, reader. With this drop of ink at the end of my pen, I will
show you the roomy workshop of Mr. Jonathan Burge, carpenter
and builder, in the village of Hayslope, as it appeared on the
eighteenth of June, in the year of our Lord 1799.
The afternoon sun was warm on the five workmen there, busy
upon doors and window-frames and wainscoting. A scent of pinewood from a tent-like pile of planks outside the open door mingled
itself with the scent of the elder-bushes which were spreading
their summer snow close to the open window opposite; the
slanting sunbeams shone through the transparent shavings that
flew before the steady plane, and lit up the fine grain of the oak
panelling which stood propped against the wall. On a heap of
those soft shavings a rough, grey shepherd dog had made himself
a pleasant bed, and was lying with his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) nose between his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) fore-paws,
occasionally wrinkling his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) brows to cast a glance at the tallest of
the five workmen, who was carving a shield in the centre of a
wooden mantelpiece. It was to this workman that the strong
baritone belonged which was heard above the sound of plane and
hammer singing--
``Awake, my soul, and with the sun
Thy daily stage of duty run;




<p/>9

<p/>Shake off dull sloth...
Here some measurement was to be taken which required more
concentrated attention, and the sonorous voice subsided into a low
whistle; but it presently broke out again with renewed vigour--
``Let all thy converse be sincere,
Thy conscience as the noonday clear.
Such a voice could only come from a broad chest, and the broad
chest belonged to a large-boned, muscular man nearly six feet
high, with a back so flat and a head so well poised that when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
drew himself up to take a more distant survey of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
the air of a soldier standing at ease. The sleeve rolled up above the
elbow showed an arm that was likely to win the prize for feats of
strength; yet the long supple hand, with its broad finger-tips,
looked ready for works of skill. In his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tall stalwartness Adam Bede
was a Saxon, and justified his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name; but the jet-black hair, made
the more noticeable by its contrast with the light paper cap, and
the keen glance of the dark eyes that shone from under strongly
marked, prominent and mobile eyebrows, indicated a mixture of
Celtic blood. The face was large and roughly hewn, and when in
repose had no other beauty than such as belongs to an expression
of good-humoured honest intelligence.
It is clear at a glance that the next workman is Adam's brother.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) is nearly as tall; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) has the same type of features, the same hue
of hair and complexion; but the strength of the family likeness
seems only to render more conspicuous the remarkable difference
of expression both in form and face. Seth's broad shoulders have a



<p/>10

<p/>slight stoop; his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) eyes are grey; his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) eyebrows have less prominence
and more repose than his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) brother's; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) glance, instead of
being keen, is confiding and benign. He (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) has thrown off his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) paper
cap, and you see that his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) hair is not thick and straight, like
Adam's, but thin and wavy, allowing you to discern the exact
contour of a coronal arch that predominates very decidedly over
the brow.
The idle tramps always felt sure they could get a copper from
Seth; they scarcely ever spoke to Adam.
The concert of the tools and Adam's voice was at last broken by
Seth, who, lifting the door at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had been working intently,
placed it against the wall, and said, <div class="bookquote">``There! I've finished my door
to-day, anyhow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The workmen all looked up; Jim Salt, a burly, red-haired man
known as Sandy Jim, paused from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) planing, and Adam said to
Seth, with a sharp glance of surprise, <div class="bookquote">``What! Dost think thee 'st
finished the door?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye, sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Seth, with answering surprise; <div class="bookquote">``what's
awanting to 't?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>A loud roar of laughter from the other three workmen made
Seth look round confusedly. Adam did not join in the laughter, but
there was a slight smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, in a gentler tone
than before, <div class="bookquote">``Why, thee 'st forgot the panels.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The laughter burst out afresh as Seth clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) hands to his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)
head, and coloured over brow and crown.
<div class="bookquote">``Hoorray!''  (<font color='red'><b>a fellow</b></font>)</div>shouted a small lithe fellow called Wiry Ben,
running forward and seizing the door. <div class="bookquote">``We'll hang up th' door at
fur end o' th' shop an' write on 't `Seth Bede, the Methody, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>)
work.' Here, Jim, lend's hould o' th' red pot.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>11

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam. <div class="bookquote">``Let it alone, Ben Cranage. You'll
mayhap be making such a slip yourself some day; you'll laugh o'
th' other side o' your mouth then.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Catch me at it, Adam. It'll be a good while afore my head's full
o' th' Methodies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben/Ben Tholoway</b></font>)</div>said Ben.
<div class="bookquote">``Nay, but it's often full o' drink, and that's worse.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ben/Ben Tholoway</b></font>)</div>Ben, however, had now got the <div class="bookquote">``red pot''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben/Ben Tholoway</b></font>)</div>in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) hand, and was
about to begin writing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) inscription, making, by way of
preliminary, an imaginary S in the air.
<div class="bookquote">``Let it alone, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam called out, laying down his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) tools,
striding up to Ben, and seizing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) right shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``Let it alone, or
I'll shake the soul out o' your body.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ben/Ben Tholoway</b></font>)</div>Ben shook in Adam's iron grasp, but, like a plucky small man as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't mean to give in. With his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left hand he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) snatched
the brush from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) powerless right, and made a movement as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would perform the feat of writing with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left. In a moment Adam
turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) round, seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) other shoulder, and, pushing him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
along, pinned him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) against the wall. But now Seth spoke.
<div class="bookquote">``Let be, Addy, let be. Ben will be joking. Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)'s i' the right to
laugh at me--I canna help laughing at myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I shan't loose him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) promises to let the door alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said
Adam.
<div class="bookquote">``Come, Ben, lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Seth, in a persuasive tone, <div class="bookquote">``don't let's
have a quarrel about it. You know Adam will have his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) way. You
may 's well try to turn a waggon in a narrow lane. Say you'll leave
the door alone, and make an end on 't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I binna frighted at Adam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben/Ben Tholoway</b></font>)</div>said Ben, <div class="bookquote">``but I donna mind sayin'
as I'll let 't alone at your askin', Seth.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ben/Ben Tholoway</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come, that's wise of you, Ben,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, laughing and



<p/>12

<p/>relaxing his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) grasp.
They all returned to their work now; but Wiry Ben, having had
the worst in the bodily contest, was bent on retrieving that
humiliation by a success in sarcasm.
<div class="bookquote">``Which was ye thinkin' on, Seth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) began--<div class="bookquote">``the pretty
parson's face or her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) sarmunt, when ye forgot the panels?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come and hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), Ben,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Seth, good-humouredly; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'s
going to preach on the Green to-night; happen ye'd get something
to think on yourself then, instead o' those wicked songs you're so
fond on. Ye might get religion, and that 'ud be the best day's
earnings y' ever made.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All i' good time for that, Seth; I'll think about that when I'm agoin' to settle i' life; bachelors doesn't want such heavy earnin's.
Happen I shall do the coortin' an' the religion both together, as ye
do, Seth; but ye wouldna ha' me get converted an' chop in atween
ye an' the pretty preacher, an' carry her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) aff?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No fear o' that, Ben; she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s neither for you nor for me to win, I
doubt. Only you come and hear her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and you won't speak lightly
on her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm half a mind t' ha' a look at her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to-night, if there isn't
good company at th' Holly Bush. What'll she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) take for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) text?
Happen ye can tell me, Seth, if so be as I shouldna come up i' time
for 't. Will 't be--what come ye out for to see? A prophetess? Yea, I
say unto you, and more than a prophetess--a uncommon pretty
young woman.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come, Ben,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, rather sternly, <div class="bookquote">``you let the words o'
the Bible alone; you're going too far now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What! Are ye a-turnin' roun', Adam? I thought ye war dead
again th' women preachin', a while agoo?''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>13

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I'm not turnin' noway. I said nought about the women
preachin'. I said, You let the Bible alone: you've got a jest-book,
han't you, as you're rare and proud on? Keep your dirty fingers to
that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, y' are gettin' as big a saint as Seth. Y’are goin' to th'
preachin' to-night, I should think. Ye'll do finely t' lead the singin'.
But I don' know what Parson Irwine 'ull say at his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) gran' favright
Adam Bede a-turnin' Methody.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Never do you bother yourself about me, Ben. I'm not a-going
to turn Methodist any more nor you are--though it's like enough
you'll turn to something worse. Mester Irwine's got more sense
nor to meddle wi' people's doing as they like in religion. That's
between themselves and God, as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s said to me many a time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye; but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s none so fond o' your dissenters, for all that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Maybe; I'm none so fond o' Josh Tod's thick ale, but I don't
hinder you from making a fool o' yourself wi't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>There was a laugh at this thrust of Adam's, but Seth said, very
seriously. <div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay, Addy, thee mustna say as anybody's
religion's like thick ale. Thee dostna believe but what the
dissenters and the Methodists have got the root o' the matter as
well as the church folks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Nay, Seth, lad; I'm not for laughing at no man's religion. Let
’em follow their consciences, that's all. Only I think it 'ud be better
if their consciences 'ud let ’em stay quiet i' the church--there's a
deal to be learnt there. And there's such a thing as being oversperitial; we must have something beside Gospel i' this world.
Look at the canals, an' th' aqueducs, an' th' coal-pit engines, and
Arkwright's mills there at Cromford; a man must learn summat
beside Gospel to make them things, I reckon. But t' hear some o'



<p/>14

<p/>them preachers, you'd think as a man must be doing nothing all's
life but shutting's eyes and looking what's agoing on inside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I
know a man must have the love o' God in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul, and the Bible's
God's word. But what does the Bible say? Why, it says as God put
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sperrit into the workman as built the tabernacle, to make him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
do all the carved work and things as wanted a nice hand. And this
is my way o' looking at it: there's the sperrit o' God in all things
and all times--weekday as well as Sunday--and i' the great works
and inventions, and i' the figuring and the mechanics. And God
helps us with our headpieces and our hands as well as with our
souls; and if a man does bits o' jobs out o' working hours--builds a
oven for 's wife to save her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) from going to the bakehouse, or scrats
at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bit o' garden and makes two potatoes grow istead o' one,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s doin' more good, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s just as near to God, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was
running after some preacher and a-praying and a-groaning.''
``Well done, Adam!'' said Sandy Jim, who had paused from his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)
planing to shift his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) planks while Adam was speaking; ``that's the
best sarmunt I've heared this long while. By th' same token, my
wife's been a-plaguin' on me to build her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a oven this twelvemont.''
``There's reason in what thee say'st, Adam,'' observed Seth,
gravely. ``But thee know'st thyself as it's hearing the preachers
thee find'st so much fault with has turned many an idle fellow into
an industrious un. It's the preacher as empties th' alehouse; and if
a man gets religion, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll do his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work none the worse for that.''
``On'y he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll lave the panels out o' th' doors sometimes, eh,
Seth?'' said Wiry Ben.
``Ah, Ben, you've got a joke again' me as 'll last you your life.
But it isna religion as was i' fault there; it was Seth Bede, as was
allays a wool-gathering chap, and religion hasna cured him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>), the



<p/>15

<p/>more's the pity.''
``Ne’er heed me, Seth,'' said Wiry Ben, ``y' are a down-right
good-hearted chap, panels or no panels; an' ye donna set up your
bristles at every bit o' fun, like some o' your kin, as is mayhap
cliverer.''
``Seth, lad,'' said Adam, taking no notice of the sarcasm against
himself, ``thee mustna take me unkind. I wasna driving at thee in
what I said just now. Some 's got one way o' looking at things and
some 's got another.''
``Nay, nay, Addy, thee mean'st me no unkindness,'' said Seth, ``I
know that well enough. Thee 't like thy dog Gyp--thee bark'st at
me sometimes, but thee allays lick'st my hand after.''
All hands worked on in silence for some minutes, until the
church clock began to strike six. Before the first stroke had died
away, Sandy Jim had loosed his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) plane and was reaching his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) jacket;
Wiry Ben had left a screw half driven in, and thrown his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)
screwdriver into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) tool-basket; Mum Taft, who, true to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) name,
had kept silence throughout the previous conversation, had flung
down his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) hammer as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) was in the act of lifting it; and Seth, too,
had straightened his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) back, and was putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) hand towards
his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) paper cap. Adam alone had gone on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) work as if nothing
had happened. But observing the cessation of the tools, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) looked
up, and said, in a tone of indignation, ``Look there, now! I can't
abide to see men throw away their tools i' that way, the minute the
clock begins to strike, as if they took no pleasure i' their work and
was afraid o' doing a stroke too much.''
Seth looked a little conscious, and began to be slower in his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)
preparations for going, but Mum Taft broke silence, and said,
``Aye, aye, Adam lad, ye talk like a young un. When y' are six-an'



<p/>16

<p/>forty like me, istid o' six-an'-twenty, ye wonna be so flush o'
workin' for nought.''
``Nonsense,'' said Adam, still wrathful; ``what's age got to do
with it, I wonder? Ye arena getting stiff yet, I reckon. I hate to see
a man's arms drop down as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was shot, before the clock's fairly
struck, just as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d never a bit o' pride and delight in 's work.
The very grindstone 'ull go on turning a bit after you loose it.''
``Bodderation, Adam!'' exclaimed Wiry Ben; ``lave a chap aloon,
will 'ee? Ye war afinding faut wi' preachers a while agoo--y' are
fond enough o' preachin' yoursen. Ye may like work better nor
play, but I like play better nor work; that'll 'commodate ye--it
laves ye th' more to do.''
With this exit speech, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) considered effective, Wiry Ben
shouldered his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) basket and left the workshop, quickly followed by
Mum Taft and Sandy Jim. Seth lingered, and looked wistfully at
Adam, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to say something.
``Shalt go home before thee go'st to the preaching?'' Adam
asked, looking up.
``Nay; I've got my hat and things at Will Maskery's. I shan't be
home before going for ten. I'll happen see Dinah Morris safe home,
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)'s willing. There's nobody comes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) from Poyser's, thee
know'st.''
``Then I'll tell mother not to look for thee,'' said Adam.
``Thee artna going to Poyser's thyself to-night?'' said Seth
rather timidly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) turned to leave the workshop.
<div class="bookquote">``Nay, I'm going to th' school.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hitherto Gyp had kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) comfortable bed, only lifting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
head and watching Adam more closely as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) noticed the other
workmen departing. But no sooner did Adam put his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) ruler in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)



<p/>17

<p/>pocket, and begin to twist his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) apron round his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) waist, than Gyp ran
forward and looked up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) master's face with patient
expectation. If Gyp had had a tail he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would doubtless have wagged
it, but being destitute of that vehicle for his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) emotions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was like
many other worthy personages, destined to appear more
phlegmatic than nature had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``What! Art ready for the basket, eh, Gyp?''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, with the
same gentle modulation of voice as when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) spoke to Seth.
Gyp jumped and gave a short bark, as much as to say, <div class="bookquote">``Of
course.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gyp</b></font>)</div>Poor fellow, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had not a great range of expression.
The basket was the one which on workdays held Adam's and
Seth's dinner; and no official, walking in procession, could look
more resolutely unconscious of all acquaintances than Gyp with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) basket, trotting at his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) master's heels.
On leaving the workshop Adam locked the door, took the key
out, and carried it to the house on the other side of the woodyard.
It was a low house, with smooth grey thatch and buff walls,
looking pleasant and mellow in the evening light. The leaded
windows were bright and speckless, and the door-stone was as
clean as a white boulder at ebb tide. On the door-stone stood a
clean old woman, in a dark-striped linen gown, a red kerchief, and
a linen cap, talking to some speckled fowls which appeared to have
been drawn towards her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) by an illusory expectation of cold
potatoes or barley. The old woman's sight seemed to be dim, for
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not recognise Adam till he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Here's the key, Dolly; lay
it down for me in the house, will you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye, sure; but wunna ye come in, Adam? Miss Mary's i' th'
house, and Mester Burge 'ull be back anon; he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>)'d be glad t' ha' ye
to supper wi'm, I'll be's warrand.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>18

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Dolly, thank you; I'm off home. Good evening.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam hastened with long strides, Gyp close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) heels, out of
the workyard, and along the highroad leading away from the
village and down to the valley. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) reached the foot of the slope,
an elderly horseman, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) portmanteau strapped behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>),
stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) horse when Adam had passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), and turned round
to have another long look at the stalwart workman in paper cap,
leather breeches, and dark-blue worsted stockings.
Adam, unconscious of the admiration he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was exciting, presently
struck across the fields, and now broke out into the tune which
had all day long been running in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) head:
``Let all thy converse be sincere,
Thy conscience as the noonday clear;
For God's all-seeing eye surveys
Thy secret thoughts, thy works and ways.

<p/>Chapter II
The Preaching

<p/>A

<p/>bout a quarter to seven there was an unusual appearance
of excitement in the village of Hayslope, and through the
whole length of its little street, from the Donnithorne
Arms to the churchyard gate, the inhabitants had evidently been
drawn out of their houses by something more than the pleasure of
lounging in the evening sunshine. The Donnithorne Arms stood at
the entrance of the village, and a small farmyard and stackyard
which flanked it, indicating that there was a pretty take of land
attached to the inn, gave the traveller a promise of good feed for
himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) horse, which might well console him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) for the
ignorance in which the weather-beaten sign left him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) as to the
heraldic bearings of that ancient family, the Donnithornes. Mr.
Casson, the landlord, had been for some time standing at the door
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) pockets, balancing himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) heels and
toes and looking towards a piece of unenclosed ground, with a
maple in the middle of it, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) knew to be the destination of
certain grave-looking men and women whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) had observed
passing at intervals.
Mr. Casson's person was by no means of that common type
which can be allowed to pass without description. On a front view
it appeared to consist principally of two spheres, bearing about the
same relation to each other as the earth and the moon: that is to
say, the lower sphere might be said, at a rough guess, to be
thirteen times larger than the upper which naturally performed




<p/>20

<p/>the function of a mere satellite and tributary. But here the
resemblance ceased, for Mr. Casson's head was not at all a
melancholy-looking satellite nor was it a <div class="bookquote">``spotty globe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casson/Casson</b></font>)</div>as Milton
has irreverently called the moon; on the contrary, no head and
face could look more sleek and healthy, and its expression--which
was chiefly confined to a pair of round and ruddy cheeks, the
slight knot and interruptions forming the nose and eyes being
scarcely worth mention--was one of jolly contentment, only
tempered by that sense of personal dignity which usually made
itself felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) attitude and bearing. This sense of dignity could
hardly be considered excessive in a man who had been butler to
<div class="bookquote">``the family''  (<font color='red'><b>butler</b></font>)</div>for fifteen years, and who, in his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) present high
position, was necessarily very much in contact with his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) inferiors.
How to reconcile his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) dignity with the satisfaction of his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) curiosity
by walking towards the Green was the problem that Mr. Casson
had been revolving in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) mind for the last five minutes; but when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) had partly solved it by taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) hands out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) pockets, and
thrusting them into the armholes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) waistcoat, by throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>)
head on one side, and providing himself with an air of
contemptuous indifference to whatever might fall under his (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) notice,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) thoughts were diverted by the approach of the horseman
whom we lately saw pausing to have another look at our friend
Adam, and who now pulled up at the door of the Donnithorne
Arms.
<div class="bookquote">``Take off the bridle and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) a drink, ostler,''  (<font color='red'><b>the traveller</b></font>)</div>said the
traveller to the lad in a smock-frock, who had come out of the yard
at the sound of the horse's hoofs.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, what's up in your pretty village, landlord?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) continued,
getting down. <div class="bookquote">``There seems to be quite a stir.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>21

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a Methodis' preaching, sir; it's been gev hout as a young
woman's a-going to preach on the Green,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casson/Casson</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Casson,
in a treble and wheezy voice, with a slightly mincing accent. <div class="bookquote">``Will
you please to step in, sir, an' tek somethink?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I must be getting on to Rosseter. I only want a drink for
my horse. And what does your parson say, I wonder, to a young
woman preaching just under his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) nose?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Parson Irwine, sir, doesn't live here; he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) lives at Brox'on, over
the hill there. The parsonage here's a tumble-down place, sir, not
fit for gentry to live in. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) comes here to preach of a Sunday
afternoon, sir, an' puts up his (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) hoss here. It's a grey cob, sir, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>)
sets great store by't. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>)'s allays put up his (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) hoss here, sir, iver since
before I hed the Donnithorne Arms. I'm not this countryman, you
may tell by my tongue, sir. They're cur'ous talkers i' this country,
sir; the gentry's hard work to hunderstand ’em. I was brought hup
among the gentry, sir, an' got the turn o' their tongue when I was a
bye. Why, what do you think the folks here says for `hevn't you?'--
the gentry, you know, says, `hevn't you'--well, the people about
here says `hanna yey.' It's what they call the dileck as is spoke
hereabout, sir. That's what I've heard Squire Donnithorne say
many a time; it's the dileck, says he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said the stranger, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``I know it very well. But
you've not got many Methodists about here, surely--in this
agricultural spot? I should have thought there would hardly be
such a thing as a Methodist to be found about here. You're all
farmers, aren't you? The Methodists can seldom lay much hold on
them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Why, sir, there's a pretty lot o' workmen round about, sir.
There's Mester Burge as owns the timber-yard over there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>)



<p/>22

<p/>underteks a good bit o' building an' repairs. An' there's the stonepits not far off. There's plenty of emply i' this countryside, sir. An'
there's a fine batch o' Methodisses at Treddles'on--that's the
market town about three mile off--you'll maybe ha' come through
it, sir. There's pretty nigh a score of ’em on the Green now, as
come from there. That's where our people gets it from, though
there's only two men of ’em in all Hayslope: that's Will Maskery,
the wheelwright, and Seth Bede, a young man as works at the
carpenterin'.''
``The preacher comes from Treddleston, then, does she (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>)?''
``Nay, sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) comes out o' Stonyshire, pretty nigh thirty mile
off. But she (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>)'s a-visitin' hereabout at Mester Poyser's at the Hall
Farm--it's them barns an' big walnut-trees, right away to the left,
sir. She (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>)'s own niece to Poyser's wife, an' they'll be fine an' vexed at
her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) for making a fool of herself i' that way. But I've heared as
there's no holding these Methodisses when the maggit's once got i'
their head: many of ’em goes stark starin' mad wi' their religion.
Though this young woman's quiet enough to look at, by what I can
make out; I've not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) myself.''
``Well, I wish I had time to wait and see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), but I must get on.
I've been out of my way for the last twenty minutes to have a look
at that place in the valley. It's Squire Donnithorne's, I suppose?''
``Yes, sir, that's Donnithorne Chase, that is. Fine hoaks there,
isn't there, sir? I should know what it is, sir, for I've lived butler
there a-going i' fifteen year. It's Captain Donnithorne as is th' heir,
sir--Squire Donnithorne's grandson. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>)'ll be comin' of hage this
'ay-'arvest, sir, an' we shall hev fine doin's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) owns all the land
about here, sir, Squire Donnithorne does.''
<div class="bookquote">``Well, it's a pretty spot, whoever may own it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the traveller,



<p/>23

<p/>mounting his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) horse; <div class="bookquote">``and one meets some fine strapping fellows
about too. I met as fine a young fellow as ever I saw in my life,
about half an hour ago, before I came up the hill--a carpenter, a
tall, broad-shouldered fellow with black hair and black eyes,
marching along like a soldier. We want such fellows as he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) to lick
the French.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye, sir, that's Adam Bede, that is, I'll be bound--Thias Bede's
son everybody knows him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) hereabout. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s an uncommon clever
stiddy fellow, an' wonderful strong. Lord bless you, sir--if you'll
hexcuse me for saying so--he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) can walk forty mile a-day, an' lift a
matter o' sixty ston'. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s an uncommon favourite wi' the gentry,
sir: Captain Donnithorne and Parson Irwine meks a fine fuss wi'
him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>)'s a little lifted up an' peppery-like.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, good evening to you, landlord; I must get on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Your servant, sir; good evenin'.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The traveller</b></font>)</div>The traveller put his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) horse into a quick walk up the village, but
when he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) approached the Green, the beauty of the view that lay on
his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) right hand, the singular contrast presented by the groups of
villagers with the knot of Methodists near the maple, and perhaps
yet more, curiosity to see the young female preacher, proved too
much for his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) anxiety to get to the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) journey, and he (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>)
paused.
The Green lay at the extremity of the village, and from it the
road branched off in two directions, one leading farther up the hill
by the church, and the other winding gently down towards the
valley. On the side of the Green that led towards the church, the
broken line of thatched cottages was continued nearly to the
churchyard gate; but on the opposite north-western side, there
was nothing to obstruct the view of gently swelling meadow, and



<p/>24

<p/>wooded valley, and dark masses of distant hill. That rich
undulating district of Loamshire to which Hayslope belonged lies
close to a grim outskirt of Stonyshire, overlooked by its barren
hills as a pretty blooming sister may sometimes be seen linked in
the arm of a rugged, tall, swarthy brother; and in two or three
hours' ride the traveller might exchange a bleak treeless region,
intersected by lines of cold grey stone, for one where his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) road
wound under the shelter of woods, or up swelling hills, muffled
with hedgerows and long meadow-grass and thick corn; and
where at every turn he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) came upon some fine old country-seat
nestled in the valley or crowning the slope, some homestead with
its long length of barn and its cluster of golden ricks, some grey
steeple looking out from a pretty confusion of trees and thatch and
dark-red tiles. It was just such a picture as this last that Hayslope
Church had made to the traveller as he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) began to mount the gentle
slope leading to its pleasant uplands, and now from his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) station
near the Green he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) had before him (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) in one view nearly all the other
typical features of this pleasant land. High up against the horizon
were the huge conical masses of hill, like giant mounds intended
to fortify this region of corn and grass against the keen and hungry
winds of the north; not distant enough to be clothed in purple
mystery, but with sombre greenish sides visibly specked with
sheep, whose motion was only revealed by memory, not detected
by sight; wooed from day to day by the changing hours, but
responding with no change in themselves--left for ever grim and
sullen after the flush of morning, the winged gleams of the April
noonday, the parting crimson glory of the ripening summer sun.
And directly below them the eye rested on a more advanced line of
hanging woods, divided by bright patches of pasture or furrowed



<p/>25

<p/>crops, and not yet deepened into the uniform leafy curtains of high
summer, but still showing the warm tints of the young oak and the
tender green of the ash and lime. Then came the valley, where the
woods grew thicker, as if they had rolled down and hurried
together from the patches left smooth on the slope, that they might
take the better care of the tall mansion which lifted its parapets
and sent its faint blue summer smoke among them. Doubtless
there was a large sweep of park and a broad glassy pool in front of
that mansion, but the swelling slope of meadow would not let our
traveller see them from the village green. He (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) saw instead a
foreground which was just as lovely--the level sunlight lying like
transparent gold among the gently curving stems of the feathered
grass and the tall red sorrel, and the white ambels of the hemlocks
lining the bushy hedgerows. It was that moment in summer when
the sound of the scythe being whetted makes us cast more
lingering looks at the flower-sprinkled tresses of the meadows.
He (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) might have seen other beauties in the landscape if he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) had
turned a little in his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) saddle and looked eastward, beyond Jonathan
Burge's pasture and woodyard towards the green corn-fields and
walnut-trees of the Hall Farm; but apparently there was more
interest for him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) in the living groups close at hand. Every
generation in the village was there, from old <div class="bookquote">``Feyther Taft''  (<font color='red'><b>the babies</b></font>)</div>in his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>)
brown worsted night-cap, who was bent nearly double, but
seemed tough enough to keep on his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) legs a long while, leaning on
his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) short stick, down to the babies with their little round heads
lolling forward in quilted linen caps. Now and then there was a
new arrival; perhaps a slouching labourer, who, having eaten his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>)
supper, came out to look at the unusual scene with a slow bovine
gaze, willing to hear what any one had to say in explanation of it,



<p/>26

<p/>but by no means excited enough to ask a question. But all took
care not to join the Methodists on the Green, and identify
themselves in that way with the expectant audience, for there was
not one of them that would not have disclaimed the imputation of
having come out to hear the <div class="bookquote">``preacher woman'' (<font color='red'><b>the audience</b></font>)</div>--they had only
come out to see <div class="bookquote">``what war a-goin' on, like.''  (<font color='red'><b>the audience</b></font>)</div>The men were chiefly
gathered in the neighbourhood of the blacksmith's shop. But do
not imagine them gathered in a knot. Villagers never swarm: a
whisper is unknown among them, and they seem almost as
incapable of an undertone as a cow or a stag. Your true rustic
turns his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) back on his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) interlocutor, throwing a question over his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>)
shoulder as if he (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) meant to run away from the answer, and walking
a step or two farther off when the interest of the dialogue
culminates. So the group in the vicinity of the blacksmith's door
was by no means a close one, and formed no screen in front of
Chad Cranage, the blacksmith himself, who stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) black
brawny arms folded, leaning against the door-post, and
occasionally sending forth a bellowing laugh at his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) own jokes,
giving them a marked preference over the sarcasms of Wiry Ben,
who had renounced the pleasures of the Holly Bush for the sake of
seeing life under a new form. But both styles of wit were treated
with equal contempt by Mr. Joshua Rann. Mr. Rann's leathern
apron and subdued griminess can leave no one in any doubt that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) is the village shoemaker; the thrusting out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) chin and
stomach and the twirling of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) thumbs are more subtle
indications, intended to prepare unwary strangers for the
discovery that they are in the presence of the parish clerk. <div class="bookquote">``Old
Joshway,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) is irreverently called by his (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) neighbours, is in a
state of simmering indignation; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) has not yet opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) lips



<p/>27

<p/>except to say, in a resounding bass undertone, like the tuning of a
violoncello, <div class="bookquote">``Sehon, King of the Amorites; for His (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) mercy endureth
for ever; and Og the King of Basan: for His (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) mercy endureth for
ever'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--a quotation which may seem to have slight bearing on the
present occasion, but, as with every other anomaly, adequate
knowledge will show it to be a natural sequence. Mr. Rann was
inwardly maintaining the dignity of the Church in the face of this
scandalous irruption of Methodism, and as that dignity was bound
up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) own sonorous utterance of the responses, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>)
argument naturally suggested a quotation from the psalm he (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) had
read the last Sunday afternoon.
The stronger curiosity of the women had drawn them quite to
the edge of the Green, where they could examine more closely the
quaker-like costume and odd deportment of the female
Methodists. Underneath the maple there was a small cart, which
had been brought from the wheelwright's to serve as a pulpit, and
round this a couple of benches and a few chairs had been placed.
Some of the Methodists were resting on these, with their eyes
closed, as if wrapt in prayer or meditation. Others chose to
continue standing, and had turned their faces towards the
villagers with a look of melancholy compassion, which was highly
amusing to Bessy Cranage, the blacksmith's buxom daughter,
known to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) neighbours as Chad's Bess, who wondered <div class="bookquote">``why the
folks war amakin' faces a that’ns.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bess</b></font>)</div>Chad's Bess was the object of
peculiar compassion, because her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hair, being turned back under a
cap which was set at the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) head, exposed to view an
ornament of which she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was much prouder than of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) red
cheeks--namely, a pair of large round ear-rings with false garnets
in them, ornaments condemned not only by the Methodists, but by



<p/>28

<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own cousin and namesake Timothy's Bess, who, with much
cousinly feeling, often wished <div class="bookquote">``them ear-rings''  (<font color='red'><b>Bess</b></font>)</div>might come to
good.
Timothy's Bess, though retaining her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) maiden appellation
among her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) familiars, had long been the wife of Sandy Jim, and
possessed a handsome set of matronly jewels, of which it is enough
to mention the heavy baby she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was rocking in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) arms, and the
sturdy fellow of five in knee-breeches, and red legs, who had a
rusty milk-can round his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) neck by way of drum, and was very
carefully avoided by Chad's small terrier. This young olive-branch,
notorious under the name of Timothy's Bess's Ben, being of an
inquiring disposition, unchecked by any false modesty, had
advanced beyond the group of women and children, and was
walking round the Methodists, looking up in their faces with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bess</b></font>)
mouth wide open, and beating his (<font color='blue'><b>Bess</b></font>) stick against the milk-can by
way of musical accompaniment. But one of the elderly women
bending down to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Bess</b></font>) by the shoulder, with an air of grave
remonstrance, Timothy's Bess's Ben first kicked out vigorously,
then took to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) heels and sought refuge behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) father's legs.
<div class="bookquote">``Ye gallows young dog,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sandy Jim/Jim</b></font>)</div>said Sandy Jim, with some paternal
pride, <div class="bookquote">``if ye donna keep that stick quiet, I'll tek it from ye. What
dy’e mane by kickin' foulks?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sandy Jim/Jim</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Here! Gie him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) here to me, Jim,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad Cranage/Chad</b></font>)</div>said Chad Cranage; <div class="bookquote">``I'll tie
hirs up an' shoe him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) as I do th' hosses. Well, Mester Casson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad Cranage/Chad</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cranage</b></font>)
continued, as that personage sauntered up towards the group of
men, ``how are ye t' naight? Are ye coom t' help groon? They say
folks allays groon when they're hearkenin' to th' Methodys, as if
they war bad i' th' inside. I mane to groon as loud as your cow did
th' other naight, an' then the praicher 'ull think I'm i' th' raight



<p/>29

<p/>way.''
``I'd advise you not to be up to no nonsense, Chad,'' said Mr.
Casson, with some dignity; ``Poyser wouldn't like to hear as his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
wife's niece was treated any ways disrespectful, for all he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) mayn't
be fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) taking on herself to preach.''
``Aye, an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)'s a pleasant-looked un too,'' said Wiry Ben. ``I'll
stick up for the pretty women preachin'; I know they'd persuade
me over a deal sooner nor th' ugly men. I shouldna wonder if I
turn Methody afore the night's out, an' begin to coort the
preacher, like Seth Bede.''
``Why, Seth's looking rether too high, I should think,'' said Mr.
Casson. ``This woman's kin wouldn't like her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to demean herself to
a common carpenter.''
``Tchu!'' said Ben, with a long treble intonation, ``what's folks's
kin got to do wi't? Not a chip. Poyser's wife may turn her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nose up
an' forget bygones, but this Dinah Morris, they tell me, 's as poor
as iver she (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was--works at a mill, an's much ado to keep hersen. A
strappin' young carpenter as is a ready-made Methody, like Seth,
wouldna be a bad match for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>). Why, Poysers make as big a fuss
wi' Adam Bede as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) war a nevvy o' their own.''
``Idle talk! idle talk!'' said Mr. Joshua Rann. ``Adam an' Seth's
two men; you wunna fit them two wi' the same last.''
``Maybe,'' said Wiry Ben, contemptuously, ``but Seth's the lad
for me, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) war a Methody twice o’er. I'm fair beat wi' Seth,
for I've been teasin' him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) iver sin' we've been workin' together, an'
he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) bears me no more malice nor a lamb. An' he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)'s a stout-hearted
feller too, for when we saw the old tree all afire a-comin' across the
fields one night, an' we thought as it war a boguy, Seth made no
more ado, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) up to 't as bold as a constable. Why, there he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)



<p/>30

<p/>comes out o' Will Maskery's; an' there's Will hisself, lookin' as
meek as if he (<font color='blue'><b>meek</b></font>) couldna knock a nail o' the head for fear o' hurtin 't.
An' there's the pretty preacher woman! My eye, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s got her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
bonnet off. I mun go a bit nearer.''
Several of the men followed Ben's lead, and the traveller
pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) horse on to the Green, as Dinah walked rather quickly
and in advance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) companions towards the cart under the
maple-tree. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was near Seth's tall figure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) looked short,
but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had mounted the cart, and was away from all
comparison, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) seemed above the middle height of woman,
though in reality she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) did not exceed it--an effect which was due to
the slimness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) figure and the simple line of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) black stuff
dress. The stranger was struck with surprise as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
approach and mount the cart--surprise, not so much at the
feminine delicacy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) appearance, as at the total absence of selfconsciousness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) demeanour. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) mind to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) advance with a measured step and a demure solemnity of
countenance; he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had felt sure that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) face would be mantled with
the smile of conscious saintship, or else charged with denunciatory
bitterness. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) knew but two types of Methodist--the ecstatic and
the bilious. But Dinah walked as simply as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) were going to
market, and seemed as unconscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) outward appearance as
a little boy: there was no blush, no tremulousness, which said, ``I
know you think me a pretty woman, too young to preach''; no
casting up or down of the eyelids, no compression of the lips, no
attitude of the arms that said, <div class="bookquote">``But you must think of me as a
saint.''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) held no book in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) ungloved hands, but let them hang
down lightly crossed before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) stood and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) grey
eyes on the people. There was no keenness in the eyes; they



<p/>31

<p/>seemed rather to be shedding love than making observations; they
had the liquid look which tells that the mind is full of what it has to
give out, rather than impressed by external objects. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) stood with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) left hand towards the descending sun, and leafy boughs
screened her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) from its rays; but in this sober light the delicate
colouring of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) face seemed to gather a calm vividness, like
flowers at evening. It was a small oval face, of a uniform
transparent whiteness, with an egg-like line of cheek and chin, a
full but firm mouth, a delicate nostril, and a low perpendicular
brow, surmounted by a rising arch of parting between smooth
locks of pale reddish hair. The hair was drawn straight back
behind the ears, and covered, except for an inch or two above the
brow, by a net Quaker cap. The eyebrows, of the same colour as
the hair, were perfectly horizontal and firmly pencilled; the
eyelashes, though no darker, were long and abundant--nothing
was left blurred or unfinished. It was one of those faces that make
one think of white flowers with light touches of colour on their
pure petals. The eyes had no peculiar beauty, beyond that of
expression; they looked so simple, so candid, so gravely loving,
that no accusing scowl, no light sneer could help melting away
before their glance. Joshua Rann gave a long cough, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) were
clearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) throat in order to come to a new understanding with
himself; Chad Cranage lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Cranage</b></font>) leather skull-cap and
scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>Cranage</b></font>) head; and Wiry Ben wondered how Seth had the
pluck to think of courting her (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``A sweet woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>the stranger said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``but surely
nature never meant her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for a preacher.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was one of those who think that nature has
theatrical properties and, with the considerate view of facilitating



<p/>32

<p/>art and psychology, <div class="bookquote">``makes up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) characters, so that there may
be no mistake about them. But Dinah began to speak.
<div class="bookquote">``Dear friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) said in a clear but not loud voice <div class="bookquote">``let us
pray for a blessing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) eyes, and hanging her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) head down a little
continued in the same moderate tone, as if speaking to some one
quite near her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>): ``Saviour of sinners! When a poor woman laden
with sins, went out to the well to draw water, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) found Thee
sitting at the well. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew Thee not; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not sought Thee;
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind was dark; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life was unholy. But Thou didst speak to
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), Thou didst teach her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), Thou didst show her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life lay
open before Thee, and yet Thou wast ready to give her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that
blessing which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had never sought. Jesus, Thou art in the midst
of us, and Thou knowest all men: if there is any here like that poor
woman--if their minds are dark, their lives unholy--if they have
come out not seeking Thee, not desiring to be taught; deal with
them according to the free mercy which Thou didst show to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
Speak to them, Lord, open their ears to my message, bring their
sins to their minds, and make them thirst for that salvation which
Thou art ready to give.
<div class="bookquote">``Lord, Thou art with Thy people still: they see Thee in the
night-watches, and their hearts burn within them as Thou talkest
with them by the way. And Thou art near to those who have not
known Thee: open their eyes that they may see Thee--see Thee
weeping over them, and saying `Ye will not come unto me that ye
might have life'--see Thee hanging on the cross and saying,
`Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do'--see Thee
as Thou wilt come again in Thy glory to judge them at the last.
Amen.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah</b></font>)</div><p/>33

<p/>Dinah opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) eyes again and paused, looking at the group
of villagers, who were now gathered rather more closely on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
right hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Dear friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) began, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) voice a little, ``you have
all of you been to church, and I think you must have heard the
clergyman read these words: `The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor.'
Jesus Christ spoke those words--he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) came to preach the
gospel to the poor. I don't know whether you ever thought about
those words much, but I will tell you when I remember first
hearing them. It was on just such a sort of evening as this, when I
was a little girl, and my aunt as brought me up took me to hear a
good man preach out of doors, just as we are here. I remember his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
face well: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a very old man, and had very long white hair; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
voice was very soft and beautiful, not like any voice I had ever
heard before. I was a little girl and scarcely knew anything, and
this old man seemed to me such a different sort of a man from
anybody I had ever seen before that I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had perhaps
come down from the sky to preach to us, and I said, `Aunt, will he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
go back to the sky to-night, like the picture in the Bible?'
``That man of God was Mr. Wesley, who spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Wesley</b></font>) life in doing
what our blessed Lord did--preaching the Gospel to the poor--
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) entered into his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) rest eight years ago. I came to know more
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) years after, but I was a foolish thoughtless child then,
and I remembered only one thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) told us in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) sermon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) told
us as `Gospel' meant `good news.' The Gospel, you know, is what
the Bible tells us about God.
``Think of that now! Jesus Christ did really come down from
heaven, as I, like a silly child, thought Mr. Wesley did; and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wesley</b></font>)



<p/>34

<p/>came down for was to tell good news about God to the poor. Why,
you and me, dear friends, are poor. We have been brought up in
poor cottages and have been reared on oat-cake, and lived coarse;
and we haven't been to school much, nor read books, and we don't
know much about anything but what happens just round us. We
are just the sort of people that want to hear good news. For when
anybody's well off, they don't much mind about hearing news from
distant parts; but if a poor man or woman's in trouble and has
hard work to make out a living, they like to have a letter to tell ’em
they've got a friend as will help ’em. To be sure, we can't help
knowing something about God, even if we've never heard the
Gospel, the good news that our Saviour brought us. For we know
everything comes from God: don't you say almost every day, `This
and that will happen, please God,' and `We shall begin to cut the
grass soon, please God to send us a little more sunshine'? We
know very well we are altogether in the hands of God. We didn't
bring ourselves into the world, we can't keep ourselves alive while
we're sleeping; the daylight, and the wind, and the corn, and the
cows to give us milk--everything we have comes from God. And
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) gave us our souls and put love between parents and children,
and husband and wife. But is that as much as we want to know
about God? We see he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is great and mighty, and can do what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
will: we are lost, as if we was struggling in great waters, when we
try to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
``But perhaps doubts come into your mind like this: Can God
take much notice of us poor people? Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) only made the
world for the great and the wise and the rich. It doesn't cost him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
much to give us our little handful of victual and bit of clothing; but
how do we know he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cares for us any more than we care for the



<p/>35

<p/>worms and things in the garden, so as we rear our carrots and
onions? Will God take care of us when we die? And has he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) any
comfort for us when we are lame and sick and helpless? Perhaps,
too, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is angry with us; else why does the blight come, and the
bad harvests, and the fever, and all sorts of pain and trouble? For
our life is full of trouble, and if God sends us good, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) seems to
send bad too. How is it? How is it?
<div class="bookquote">``Ah, dear friends, we are in sad want of good news about God;
and what does other good news signify if we haven't that? For
everything else comes to an end, and when we die we leave it all.
But God lasts when everything else is gone. What shall we do if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
is not our friend?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>Then Dinah told how the good news had been brought, and
how the mind of God towards the poor had been made manifest in
the life of Jesus, dwelling on its lowliness and its acts of mercy.
<div class="bookquote">``So you see, dear friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) went on, ``Jesus spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) time
almost all in doing good to poor people; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) preached out of doors
to them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) made friends of poor workmen, and taught them
and took pains with them. Not but what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) did good to the rich
too, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) was full of love to all men, only he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) saw as the poor were
more in want of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) help. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) cured the lame and the sick and
the blind, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) worked miracles to feed the hungry because, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>)
said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) was sorry for them; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) was very kind to the little
children and comforted those who had lost their friends; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>)
spoke very tenderly to poor sinners that were sorry for their sins.
``Ah, wouldn't you love such a man if you saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were
here in this village? What a kind heart he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must have! What a
friend he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be to go to in trouble! How pleasant it must be to
be taught by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).



<p/>36

<p/>``Well, dear friends, who was this man? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only a good
man--a very good man, and no more--like our dear Mr. Wesley,
who has been taken from us? ... He (<font color='blue'><b>Wesley</b></font>) was the Son of God--`in the
image of the Father,' the Bible says; that means, just like God, who
is the beginning and end of all things--the God we want to know
about. So then, all the love that Jesus showed to the poor is the
same love that God has for us. We can understand what Jesus felt,
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) came in a body like ours and spoke words such as we
speak to each other. We were afraid to think what God was
before--the God who made the world and the sky and the thunder
and lightning. We could never see him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); we could only see the
things he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had made; and some of these things was very terrible, so
as we might well tremble when we thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). But our blessed
Saviour has showed us what God is in a way us poor ignorant
people can understand; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has showed us what God's heart is,
what are his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) feelings towards us.
``But let us see a little more about what Jesus came on earth for.
Another time he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) said, `I came to seek and to save that which was
lost'; and another time, `I came not to call the righteous but
sinners to repentance.'
<div class="bookquote">``The lost! ... Sinners! ... Ah, dear friends, does that mean you
and me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the traveller</b></font>)</div>Hitherto the traveller had been chained to the spot against his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>)
will by the charm of Dinah's mellow treble tones, which had a
variety of modulation like that of a fine instrument touched with
the unconscious skill of musical instinct. The simple things she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
said seemed like novelties, as a melody strikes us with a new
feeling when we hear it sung by the pure voice of a boyish
chorister; the quiet depth of conviction with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) spoke



<p/>37

<p/>seemed in itself an evidence for the truth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) message. He (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) saw
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had thoroughly arrested her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hearers. The villagers had
pressed nearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), and there was no longer anything but grave
attention on all faces. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) spoke slowly, though quite fluently,
often pausing after a question, or before any transition of ideas.
There was no change of attitude, no gesture; the effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
speech was produced entirely by the inflections of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) voice, and
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) came to the question, <div class="bookquote">``Will God take care of us when we
die?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) uttered it in such a tone of plaintive appeal that the tears
came into some of the hardest eyes. The stranger had ceased to
doubt, as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had done at the first glance, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) could fix the
attention of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) rougher hearers, but still he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) wondered whether
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) could have that power of rousing their more violent emotions,
which must surely be a necessary seal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) vocation as a
Methodist preacher, until she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) came to the words, <div class="bookquote">``Lost!--
Sinners!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>when there was a great change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) voice and manner.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had made a long pause before the exclamation, and the pause
seemed to be filled by agitating thoughts that showed themselves
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) features. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) pale face became paler; the circles under her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
eyes deepened, as they did when tears half-gather without falling;
and the mild loving eyes took an expression of appalled pity, as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had suddenly discerned a destroying angel hovering over the
heads of the people. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) voice became deep and muffled, but there
was still no gesture. Nothing could be less like the ordinary type of
the Ranter than Dinah. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was not preaching as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) heard others
preach, but speaking directly from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) own emotions and under
the inspiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) own simple faith.
But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had entered into a new current of feeling. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
manner became less calm, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) utterance more rapid and agitated,



<p/>38

<p/>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) tried to bring home to the people their guilt their wilful
darkness, their state of disobedience to God--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) dwelt on the
hatefulness of sin, the Divine holiness, and the sufferings of the
Saviour, by which a way had been opened for their salvation. At
last it seemed as if, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) yearning desire to reclaim the lost
sheep, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) could not be satisfied by addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hearers as a
body. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) appealed first to one and then to another, beseeching
them with tears to turn to God while there was yet time; painting
to them the desolation of their souls, lost in sin, feeding on the
husks of this miserable world, far away from God their Father; and
then the love of the Saviour, who was waiting and watching for
their return.
There was many a responsive sigh and groan from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) fellowMethodists, but the village mind does not easily take fire, and a
little smouldering vague anxiety that might easily die out again
was the utmost effect Dinah's preaching had wrought in them at
present. Yet no one had retired, except the children and <div class="bookquote">``old
Feyther Taft,''  (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div>who being too deaf to catch many words, had some
time ago gone back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) ingle-nook. Wiry Ben was feeling very
uncomfortable, and almost wishing he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) had not come to hear
Dinah; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) thought what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) said would haunt him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) somehow. Yet
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) couldn't help liking to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) and listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)
dreaded every moment that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would fix her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) and
address him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) in particular. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had already addressed Sandy Jim,
who was now holding the baby to relieve his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) wife, and the big softhearted man had rubbed away some tears with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) fist, with a
confused intention of being a better fellow, going less to the Holly
Bush down by the Stone-pits, and cleaning himself more regularly
of a Sunday.



<p/>39

<p/>In front of Sandy Jim stood Chad's Bess, who had shown an
unwonted quietude and fixity of attention ever since Dinah had
begun to speak. Not that the matter of the discourse had arrested
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) at once, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was lost in a puzzling speculation as to what
pleasure and satisfaction there could be in life to a young woman
who wore a cap like Dinah's. Giving up this inquiry in despair, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
took to studying Dinah's nose, eyes, mouth, and hair, and
wondering whether it was better to have such a sort of pale face as
that, or fat red cheeks and round black eyes like her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) own. But
gradually the influence of the general gravity told upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) became conscious of what Dinah was saying. The gentle tones,
the loving persuasion, did not touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), but when the more
severe appeals came she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) began to be frightened. Poor Bessy had
always been considered a naughty girl; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was conscious of it; if it
was necessary to be very good, it was clear she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must be in a bad
way. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) couldn't find her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) places at church as Sally Rann could,
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had often been tittering when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``curcheyed''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>to Mr. Irwine;
and these religious deficiencies were accompanied by a
corresponding slackness in the minor morals, for Bessy belonged
unquestionably to that unsoaped lazy class of feminine characters
with whom you may venture to <div class="bookquote">``eat an egg, an apple, or a nut.''  (<font color='red'><b>characters</b></font>)</div>All
this she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was generally conscious of, and hitherto had not been
greatly ashamed of it. But now she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) began to feel very much as if
the constable had come to take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) up and carry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) before the
justice for some undefined offence. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had a terrified sense that
God, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had always thought of as very far off, was very
near to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and that Jesus was close by looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
could not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>). For Dinah had that belief in visible
manifestations of Jesus, which is common among the Methodists,



<p/>40

<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) communicated it irresistibly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hearers: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) made
them feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) was among them bodily, and might at any
moment show himself to them in some way that would strike
anguish and penitence into their hearts.
<div class="bookquote">``See!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) exclaimed, turning to the left, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) eyes fixed on
a point above the heads of the people. <div class="bookquote">``See where our blessed
Lord stands and weeps and stretches out his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) arms towards you.
Hear what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) says: `How often would I have gathered you as a hen
gathereth her (<font color='blue'><b>Taft</b></font>) chickens under her (<font color='blue'><b>Taft</b></font>) wings, and ye would not!' ...
and ye would not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) repeated, in a tone of pleading reproach,
turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) eyes on the people again. ``See the print of the nails on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) dear hands and feet. It is your sins that made them! Ah! How
pale and worn he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) looks! He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) has gone through all that great agony
in the garden, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) soul was exceeding sorrowful even unto
death, and the great drops of sweat fell like blood to the ground.
They spat upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) and buffeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), they scourged him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), they
mocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), they laid the heavy cross on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) bruised shoulders.
Then they nailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) up. Ah, what pain! His (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) lips are parched with
thirst, and they mock him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) still in this great agony; yet with those
parched lips he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) prays for them, `Father, forgive them, for they
know not what they do.' Then a horror of great darkness fell upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) felt what sinners feel when they are for ever shut out
from God. That was the last drop in the cup of bitterness. `My God,
my God!' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cries, `why hast Thou forsaken me?'
``All this he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) bore for you! For you--and you never think of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>);
for you--and you turn your backs on him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); you don't care what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
has gone through for you. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is not weary of toiling for you: he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
has risen from the dead, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is praying for you at the right hand of
God--`Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.' And



<p/>41

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is upon this earth too; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is among us; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is there close to you
now; I see his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wounded body and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) look of love.''
Here Dinah turned to Bessy Cranage, whose bonny youth and
evident vanity had touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) with pity.
``Poor child! Poor child! He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is beseeching you, and you don't
listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). You think of ear-rings and fine gowns and caps, and
you never think of the Saviour who died to save your precious
soul. Your cheeks will be shrivelled one day, your hair will be grey,
your poor body will be thin and tottering! Then you will begin to
feel that your soul is not saved; then you will have to stand before
God dressed in your sins, in your evil tempers and vain thoughts.
And Jesus, who stands ready to help you now, won't help you
then; because you won't have him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) to be your Saviour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) will be
your judge. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) looks at you with love and mercy and says,
`Come to me that you may have life'; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) will turn away from
you, and say, `Depart from me into ever-lasting fire!'''
Poor Bessy's wide-open black eyes began to fill with tears, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>)
great red cheeks and lips became quite pale, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) face was
distorted like a little child's before a burst of crying.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah, poor blind child!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>Dinah went on, <div class="bookquote">``think if it should
happen to you as it once happened to a servant of God in the days
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) vanity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) lace caps and saved all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) money
to buy ’em; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) thought nothing about how she (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) might get a clean
heart and a right spirit--she (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) only wanted to have better lace than
other girls. And one day when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) new cap on and looked
in the glass, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) saw a bleeding Face crowned with thorns. That
face is looking at you now'' (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>--here Dinah pointed to a spot close in
front of Bessy--``Ah, tear off those follies! Cast them away from
you, as if they were stinging adders. They are stinging you--they



<p/>42

<p/>are poisoning your soul--they are dragging you down into a dark
bottomless pit, where you will sink for ever, and for ever, and for
ever, further away from light and God.''
Bessy could bear it no longer: a great terror was upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), and
wrenching her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) ear-rings from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) ears, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) threw them down
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), sobbing aloud. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) father, Chad, frightened lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
should be ``laid hold on'' too, this impression on the rebellious
Bess striking him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) as nothing less than a miracle, walked hastily
away and began to work at his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) anvil by way of reassuring himself.
``Folks mun ha' hoss-shoes, praichin' or no praichin': the divil
canna lay hould o' me for that,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) muttered to himself.
But now Dinah began to tell of the joys that were in store for
the penitent, and to describe in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) simple way the divine peace
and love with which the soul of the believer is filled--how the
sense of God's love turns poverty into riches and satisfies the soul
so that no uneasy desire vexes it, no fear alarms it: how, at last, the
very temptation to sin is extinguished, and heaven is begun upon
earth, because no cloud passes between the soul and God, who is
its eternal sun.
``Dear friends,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) said at last, ``brothers and sisters, whom I
love as those for whom my Lord has died, believe me, I know what
this great blessedness is; and because I know it, I want you to have
it too. I am poor, like you: I have to get my living with my hands;
but no lord nor lady can be so happy as me, if they haven't got the
love of God in their souls. Think what it is--not to hate anything
but sin; to be full of love to every creature; to be frightened at
nothing; to be sure that all things will turn to good; not to mind
pain, because it is our Father's will; to know that nothing--no, not
if the earth was to be burnt up, or the waters come and drown



<p/>43

<p/>us--nothing could part us from God who loves us, and who fills
our souls with peace and joy, because we are sure that whatever
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wills is holy, just, and good.
``Dear friends, come and take this blessedness; it is offered to
you; it is the good news that Jesus came to preach to the poor. It is
not like the riches of this world, so that the more one gets the less
the rest can have. God is without end; his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) love is without end--
Its streams the whole creation reach,
So plenteous is the store;
Enough for all, enough for each,
Enough for evermore.
Dinah had been speaking at least an hour, and the reddening
light of the parting day seemed to give a solemn emphasis to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
closing words. The stranger, who had been interested in the
course of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) sermon as if it had been the development of a
drama--for there is this sort of fascination in all sincere
unpremeditated eloquence, which opens to one the inward drama
of the speaker's emotions--now turned his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) horse aside and
pursued his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) way, while Dinah said, <div class="bookquote">``Let us sing a little, dear
friends'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was still winding down the slope, the voices of
the Methodists reached him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), rising and falling in that strange
blending of exultation and sadness which belongs to the cadence
of a hymn.




<p/>44

<p/>Chapter III
After the Preaching

<p/>I

<p/>n less than an hour from that time, Seth Bede was walking by
Dinah's side along the hedgerow-path that skirted the
pastures and green corn-fields which lay between the village
and the Hall Farm. Dinah had taken off her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) little Quaker bonnet
again, and was holding it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hands that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) might have a freer
enjoyment of the cool evening twilight, and Seth could see the
expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) face quite clearly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) walked by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) side,
timidly revolving something he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) wanted to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). It was an
expression of unconscious placid gravity--of absorption in
thoughts that had no connection with the present moment or with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) own personality--an expression that is most of all
discouraging to a lover. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) very walk was discouraging: it had
that quiet elasticity that asks for no support. Seth felt this dimly;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s too good and holy for any man, let alone
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and the words he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had been summoning rushed back again
before they had reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) lips. But another thought gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)
courage: <div class="bookquote">``There's no man could love her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) better and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) freer
to follow the Lord's work.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>They had been silent for many minutes
now, since they had done talking about Bessy Cranage; Dinah
seemed almost to have forgotten Seth's presence, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) pace
was becoming so much quicker that the sense of their being only a
few minutes' walk from the yard-gates of the Hall Farm at last
gave Seth courage to speak.
``You've quite made up your mind to go back to Snowfield o'




<p/>45

<p/>Saturday, Dinah?''
``Yes,'' said Dinah, quietly. ``I'm called there. It was borne in
upon my mind while I was meditating on Sunday night, as Sister
Allen, who's in a decline, is in need of me. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) as plain as we
see that bit of thin white cloud, lifting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) poor thin hand and
beckoning to me. And this morning when I opened the Bible for
direction, the first words my eyes fell on were, `And after we had
seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into
Macedonia.' If it wasn't for that clear showing of the Lord's will, I
should be loath to go, for my heart yearns over my aunt and her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
little ones, and that poor wandering lamb Hetty Sorrel. I've been
much drawn out in prayer for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) of late, and I look on it as a
token that there may be mercy in store for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>).''
``God grant it,'' said Seth. ``For I doubt Adam's heart is so set on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'ll never turn to anybody else; and yet it 'ud go to my heart
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), for I canna think as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'d make him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) happy.
It's a deep mystery--the way the heart of man turns to one woman
out of all the rest he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s seen i' the world, and makes it easier for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
to work seven year for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), like Jacob did for Rachel, sooner than
have any other woman for th' asking. I often think of them words,
`And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)
but a few days for the love he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) had to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>).' I know those words 'ud
come true with me, Dinah, if so be you'd give me hope as I might
win you after seven years was over. I know you think a husband
'ud be taking up too much o' your thoughts, because St. Paul says,
`She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) that's married careth for the things of the world how she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) may
please her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) husband'; and may happen you'll think me overbold to
speak to you about it again, after what you told me o' your mind
last Saturday. But I've been thinking it over again by night and by



<p/>46

<p/>day, and I've prayed not to be blinded by my own desires, to think
what's only good for me must be good for you too. And it seems to
me there's more texts for your marrying than ever you can find
against it. For St. Paul says as plain as can be in another place, `I
will that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the
house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully';
and then `two are better than one'; and that holds good with
marriage as well as with other things. For we should be o' one
heart and o' one mind, Dinah. We both serve the same Master, and
are striving after the same gifts; and I'd never be the husband to
make a claim on you as could interfere with your doing the work
God has fitted you for. I'd make a shift, and fend indoor and out, to
give you more liberty--more than you can have now, for you've
got to get your own living now, and I'm strong enough to work for
us both.''
When Seth had once begun to urge his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) suit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) went on
earnestly and almost hurriedly, lest Dinah should speak some
decisive word before he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had poured forth all the arguments he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had
prepared. His (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) cheeks became flushed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) went on his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) mild grey
eyes filled with tears, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) voice trembled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) spoke the last
sentence. They had reached one of those very narrow passes
between two tall stones, which performed the office of a stile in
Loamshire, and Dinah paused as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) turned towards Seth and
said, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) tender but calm treble notes, <div class="bookquote">``Seth Bede, I thank you
for your love towards me, and if I could think of any man as more
than a Christian brother, I think it would be you. But my heart is
not free to marry. That is good for other women, and it is a great
and a blessed thing to be a wife and mother; but `as God has
distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every man, so let



<p/>47

<p/>him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) walk.' God has called me to minister to others, not to have any
joys or sorrows of my own, but to rejoice with them that do rejoice,
and to weep with those that weep. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has called me to speak his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
word, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has greatly owned my work. It could only be on a
very clear showing that I could leave the brethren and sisters at
Snowfield, who are favoured with very little of this world's good;
where the trees are few, so that a child might count them, and
there's very hard living for the poor in the winter. It has been
given me to help, to comfort, and strengthen the little flock there
and to call in many wanderers; and my soul is filled with these
things from my rising up till my lying down. My life is too short,
and God's work is too great for me to think of making a home for
myself in this world. I've not turned a deaf ear to your words, Seth,
for when I saw as your love was given to me, I thought it might be
a leading of Providence for me to change my way of life, and that
we should be fellow-helpers; and I spread the matter before the
Lord. But whenever I tried to fix my mind on marriage, and our
living together, other thoughts always came in--the times when
I've prayed by the sick and dying, and the happy hours I've had
preaching, when my heart was filled with love, and the Word was
given to me abundantly. And when I've opened the Bible for
direction, I've always lighted on some clear word to tell me where
my work lay. I believe what you say, Seth, that you would try to be
a help and not a hindrance to my work; but I see that our marriage
is not God's will--He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) draws my heart another way. I desire to live
and die without husband or children. I seem to have no room in
my soul for wants and fears of my own, it has pleased God to fill
my heart so full with the wants and sufferings of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) poor people.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Seth was unable to reply, and they walked on in silence. At last,



<p/>48

<p/>as they were nearly at the yard-gate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) said--
<div class="bookquote">``Well, Dinah, I must seek for strength to bear it, and to endure
as seeing Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) who is invisible. But I feel now how weak my faith
is. It seems as if, when you are gone, I could never joy in anything
any more. I think it's something passing the love of women as I
feel for you, for I could be content without your marrying me if I
could go and live at Snowfield and be near you. I trusted as the
strong love God has given me towards you was a leading for us
both; but it seems it was only meant for my trial. Perhaps I feel
more for you than I ought to feel for any creature, for I often can't
help saying of you what the hymn says--
In darkest shades if she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) appear,
My dawning is begun;
She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is my soul's bright morning-star,
And she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) my rising sun.
That may be wrong, and I am to be taught better. But you
wouldn't be displeased with me if things turned out so as I could
leave this country and go to live at Snowfield?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Seth; but I counsel you to wait patiently, and not lightly to
leave your own country and kindred. Do nothing without the
Lord's clear bidding. It's a bleak and barren country there, not like
this land of Goshen you've been used to. We mustn't be in a hurry
to fix and choose our own lot; we must wait to be guided.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you'd let me write you a letter, Dinah, if there was
anything I wanted to tell you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sure; let me know if you're in any trouble. You'll be
continually in my prayers.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div><p/>49

<p/>They had now reached the yard-gate, and Seth said, <div class="bookquote">``I won't go
in, Dinah, so farewell.''  (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) paused and hesitated after she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had
given him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hand, and then said, <div class="bookquote">``There's no knowing but what
you may see things different after a while. There may be a new
leading.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let us leave that, Seth. It's good to live only a moment at a
time, as I've read in one of Mr. Wesley's books. It isn't for you and
me to lay plans; we've nothing to do but to obey and to trust.
Farewell.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>Dinah pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) hand with rather a sad look in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) loving
eyes, and then passed through the gate, while Seth turned away to
walk lingeringly home. But instead of taking the direct road, he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)
chose to turn back along the fields through which he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) and Dinah
had already passed; and I think his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) blue linen handkerchief was
very wet with tears long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) mind that it
was time for him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) to set his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) face steadily homewards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) was but
three-and-twenty, and had only just learned what it is to love--to
love with that adoration which a young man gives to a woman
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feels to be greater and better than himself. Love of this
sort is hardly distinguishable from religious feeling. What deep
and worthy love is so, whether of woman or child, or art or music.
Our caresses, our tender words, our still rapture under the
influence of autumn sunsets, or pillared vistas, or calm majestic
statues, or Beethoven symphonies all bring with them the
consciousness that they are mere waves and ripples in an
unfathomable ocean of love and beauty; our emotion in its keenest
moment passes from expression into silence, our love at its highest
flood rushes beyond its object and loses itself in the sense of divine
mystery. And this blessed gift of venerating love has been given to



<p/>50

<p/>too many humble craftsmen since the world began for us to feel
any surprise that it should have existed in the soul of a Methodist
carpenter half a century ago, while there was yet a lingering afterglow from the time when Wesley and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wesley</b></font>) fellow-labourer fed on
the hips and haws of the Cornwall hedges, after exhausting limbs
and lungs in carrying a divine message to the poor.
That after-glow has long faded away; and the picture we are apt
to make of Methodism in our imagination is not an amphitheatre
of green hills, or the deep shade of broad-leaved sycamores, where
a crowd of rough men and weary-hearted women drank in a faith
which was a rudimentary culture, which linked their thoughts
with the past, lifted their imagination above the sordid details of
their own narrow lives, and suffused their souls with the sense of a
pitying, loving, infinite Presence, sweet as summer to the
houseless needy. It is too possible that to some of my readers
Methodism may mean nothing more than low-pitched gables up
dingy streets, sleek grocers, sponging preachers, and hypocritical
jargon--elements which are regarded as an exhaustive analysis of
Methodism in many fashionable quarters.
That would be a pity; for I cannot pretend that Seth and Dinah
were anything else than Methodists--not indeed of that modern
type which reads quarterly reviews and attends in chapels with
pillared porticoes, but of a very old-fashioned kind. They believed
in present miracles, in instantaneous conversions, in revelations
by dreams and visions; they drew lots, and sought for Divine
guidance by opening the Bible at hazard; having a literal way of
interpreting the Scriptures, which is not at all sanctioned by
approved commentators; and it is impossible for me to represent
their diction as correct, or their instruction as liberal. Still--if I



<p/>51

<p/>have read religious history aright--faith, hope, and charity have
not always been found in a direct ratio with a sensibility to the
three concords, and it is possible--thank Heaven!--to have very
erroneous theories and very sublime feelings. The raw bacon
which clumsy Molly spares from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own scanty store that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
may carry it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) neighbour's child to <div class="bookquote">``stop the fits,''  (<font color='red'><b>neighbour child</b></font>)</div>may be a
piteously inefficacious remedy; but the generous stirring of
neighbourly kindness that prompted the deed has a beneficent
radiation that is not lost.
Considering these things, we can hardly think Dinah and Seth
beneath our sympathy, accustomed as we may be to weep over the
loftier sorrows of heroines in satin boots and crinoline, and of
heroes riding fiery horses, themselves ridden by still more fiery
passions.
Poor Seth! He (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) was never on horseback in his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) life except once,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) was a little lad, and Mr. Jonathan Burge took him (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) up
behind, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) to <div class="bookquote">``hold on tight'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>; and instead of bursting out
into wild accusing apostrophes to God and destiny, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is resolving,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) now walks homewards under the solemn starlight, to repress
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sadness, to be less bent on having his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own will, and to live
more for others, as Dinah does.




<p/>52

<p/>Chapter IV
Home and Its Sorrows

<p/>A

<p/>green valley with a brook running through it, full almost
to overflowing with the late rains, overhung by low
stooping willows. Across this brook a plank is thrown, and
over this plank Adam Bede is passing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) undoubting step,
followed close by Gyp with the basket; evidently making his (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) way to
the thatched house, with a stack of timber by the side of it, about
twenty yards up the opposite slope.
The door of the house is open, and an elderly woman is looking
out; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is not placidly contemplating the evening sunshine;
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has been watching with dim eyes the gradually enlarging
speck which for the last few minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has been quite sure is her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
darling son Adam. Lisbeth Bede loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) son with the love of a
woman to whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) first-born has come late in life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) is an
anxious, spare, yet vigorous old woman, clean as a snowdrop. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
grey hair is turned neatly back under a pure linen cap with a black
band round it; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) broad chest is covered with a buff neckerchief,
and below this you see a sort of short bed-gown made of bluecheckered linen, tied round the waist and descending to the hips,
from whence there is a considerable length of linsey-woolsey
petticoat. For Lisbeth is tall, and in other points too there is a
strong likeness between her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) son Adam. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) dark eyes are
somewhat dim now--perhaps from too much crying--but her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>)
broadly marked eyebrows are still black, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) teeth are sound, and
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) stands knitting rapidly and unconsciously with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) work-




<p/>53

<p/>hardened hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) has as firmly upright an attitude as when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>)
is carrying a pail of water on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) head from the spring. There is
the same type of frame and the same keen activity of temperament
in mother and son, but it was not from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that Adam got his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) wellfilled brow and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) expression of large-hearted intelligence.
Family likeness has often a deep sadness in it. Nature, that
great tragic dramatist, knits us together by bone and muscle, and
divides us by the subtler web of our brains; blends yearning and
repulsion; and ties us by our heart-strings to the beings that jar us
at every movement. We hear a voice with the very cadence of our
own uttering the thoughts we despise; we see eyes--ah, so like our
mother's!--averted from us in cold alienation; and our last darling
child startles us with the air and gestures of the sister we parted
from in bitterness long years ago. The father to whom we owe our
best heritage--the mechanical instinct, the keen sensibility to
harmony, the unconscious skill of the modelling hand--galls us
and puts us to shame by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daily errors; the long-lost mother,
whose face we begin to see in the glass as our own wrinkles come,
once fretted our young souls with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) anxious humours and
irrational persistence.
It is such a fond anxious mother's voice that you hear, as
Lisbeth says, <div class="bookquote">``Well, my lad, it's gone seven by th' clock. Thee 't
allays stay till the last child's born. Thee wants thy supper, I'll
warrand. Where's Seth? Gone arter some o's chapellin', I reckon?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye, Seth's at no harm, mother, thee mayst be sure.
But where's father?''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam quickly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) entered the
house and glanced into the room on the left hand, which was used
as a workshop. <div class="bookquote">``Hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) done the coffin for Tholer? There's the
stuff standing just as I left it this morning.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>54

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Done the coffin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Lisbeth, following him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), and knitting
uninterruptedly, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) son very anxiously. <div class="bookquote">``Eh,
my lad, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) went aff to Treddles'on this forenoon, an's niver come
back. I doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'s got to th' `Waggin Overthrow' again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>A deep flush of anger passed rapidly over Adam's face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said
nothing, but threw off his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) jacket and began to roll up his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) shirtsleeves again.
<div class="bookquote">``What art goin' to do, Adam?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother, with a tone and
look of alarm. <div class="bookquote">``Thee wouldstna go to work again, wi’out ha’in thy
bit o' supper?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam, too angry to speak, walked into the workshop. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
mother threw down her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knitting, and, hurrying after him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), took
hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) arm, and said, in a tone of plaintive remonstrance,
<div class="bookquote">``Nay, my lad, my lad, thee munna go wi’out thy supper; there's the
taters wi' the gravy in ’em, just as thee lik'st ’em. I saved ’em o'
purpose for thee. Come an' ha' thy supper, come.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let be!''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam impetuously, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) off and seizing
one of the planks that stood against the wall. <div class="bookquote">``It's fine talking
about having supper when here's a coffin promised to be ready at
Brox'on by seven o’clock to-morrow morning, and ought to ha'
been there now, and not a nail struck yet. My throat's too full to
swallow victuals.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, thee canstna get the coffin ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Lisbeth. <div class="bookquote">``Thee 't

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What signifies how long it takes me? Isn't the coffin promised?
Can they bury the man without a coffin? I'd work my right hand
off sooner than deceive people with lies i' that way. It makes me
mad to think on 't. I shall overrun these doings before long. I've
stood enough of ’em.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div><p/>55

<p/>Poor Lisbeth did not hear this threat for the first time, and if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) had been wise she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) would have gone away quietly and said
nothing for the next hour. But one of the lessons a woman most
rarely learns is never to talk to an angry or a drunken man.
Lisbeth sat down on the chopping bench and began to cry, and by
the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) had cried enough to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) voice very piteous, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>)
burst out into words.
<div class="bookquote">``Nay, my lad, my lad, thee wouldstna go away an' break thy
mother's heart, an' leave thy feyther to ruin. Thee wouldstna ha'
’em carry me to th' churchyard, an' thee not to follow me. I shanna
rest i' my grave if I donna see thee at th' last; an' how's they to let
thee know as I'm a-dyin', if thee 't gone a-workin' i' distant parts,
an' Seth belike gone arter thee, and thy feyther not able to hold a
pen for's hand shakin', besides not knowin' where thee art? Thee
mun forgie thy feyther--thee munna be so bitter again' him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)
war a good feyther to thee afore he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) took to th' drink. He (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)'s a clever
workman, an' taught thee thy trade, remember, an's niver gen me
a blow nor so much as an ill word--no, not even in 's drink. Thee
wouldstna ha' 'm go to the workhus--thy own feyther--an' him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) as
was a fine-growed man an' handy at everythin' amost as thee art
thysen, five-an'-twenty 'ear ago, when thee wast a baby at the
breast.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>Lisbeth's voice became louder, and choked with sobs--a sort of
wail, the most irritating of all sounds where real sorrows are to be
borne and real work to be done. Adam broke in impatiently.
``Now, Mother, don't cry and talk so. Haven't I got enough to
vex me without that? What's th' use o' telling me things as I only
think too much on every day? If I didna think on ’em, why should I
do as I do, for the sake o' keeping things together here? But I hate



<p/>56

<p/>to be talking where it's no use: I like to keep my breath for doing
i'stead o' talking.''
``I know thee dost things as nobody else 'ud do, my lad. But thee
't allays so hard upo' thy feyther, Adam. Thee think'st nothing too
much to do for Seth: thee snapp'st me up if iver I find faut wi' th'
lad. But thee 't so angered wi' thy feyther, more nor wi' anybody
else.''
<div class="bookquote">``That's better than speaking soft and letting things go the
wrong way, I reckon, isn't it? If I wasn't sharp with him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'d sell
every bit o' stuff i' th' yard and spend it on drink. I know there's a
duty to be done by my father, but it isn't my duty to encourage
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in running headlong to ruin. And what has Seth got to do with
it? The lad does no harm as I know of. But leave me alone,
Mother, and let me get on with the work.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Lisbeth dared not say any more; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) got up and called Gyp,
thinking to console herself somewhat for Adam's refusal of the
supper she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) had spread out in the loving expectation of looking at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) ate it, by feeding Adam's dog with extra liberality.
But Gyp was watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) master with wrinkled brow and ears
erect, puzzled at this unusual course of things; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
glanced at Lisbeth when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), and moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) fore-paws
uneasily, well knowing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) was inviting him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to supper, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was
in a divided state of mind, and remained seated on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) haunches,
again fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) eyes anxiously on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) master. Adam noticed Gyp's
mental conflict, and though his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) anger had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) less tender
than usual to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother, it did not prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) from caring as
much as usual for his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) dog. We are apt to be kinder to the brutes
that love us than to the women that love us. Is it because the
brutes are dumb?



<p/>57

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go, Gyp; go, lad!''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam said, in a tone of encouraging
command; and Gyp, apparently satisfied that duty and pleasure
were one, followed Lisbeth into the house-place.
But no sooner had he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) licked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) supper than he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) went back to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) master, while Lisbeth sat down alone to cry over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) knitting.
Women who are never bitter and resentful are often the most
querulous; and if Solomon was as wise as he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) is reputed to be, I feel
sure that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) compared a contentious woman to a continual
dropping on a very rainy day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) had not a vixen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) eye--a fury
with long nails, acrid and selfish. Depend upon it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) meant a good
creature, who had no joy but in the happiness of the loved ones
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>vixen</b></font>) contributed to make uncomfortable, putting by all the
tid-bits for them and spending nothing on herself. Such a woman
as Lisbeth, for example--at once patient and complaining, selfrenouncing and exacting, brooding the livelong day over what
happened yesterday and what is likely to happen to-morrow, and
crying very readily both at the good and the evil. But a certain awe
mingled itself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) idolatrous love of Adam, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``Leave me alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) was always silenced.
So the hours passed, to the loud ticking of the old day-clock and
the sound of Adam's tools. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) called for a light and a
draught of water -LRB-beer was a thing only to be drunk on holidays-RRB-,
and Lisbeth ventured to say as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) took it in, <div class="bookquote">``Thy supper stan's
ready for thee, when thee lik'st.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Donna thee sit up, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Adam, in a gentle tone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
had worked off his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) anger now, and whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) wished to be
especially kind to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) fell into his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) strongest native
accent and dialect, with which at other times his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) speech was less
deeply tinged. ``I'll see to Father when he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) comes home; maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)



<p/>58

<p/>wonna come at all to-night. I shall be easier if thee 't i' bed.''
``Nay, I'll bide till Seth comes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) wonna be long now, I
reckon.''
It was then past nine by the clock, which was always in advance
of the days, and before it had struck ten the latch was lifted and
Seth entered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had heard the sound of the tools as he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) was
approaching.
``Why, Mother,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) said, ``how is it as Father's working so late?''
``It's none o' thy feyther as is a-workin'--thee might know that
well anoof if thy head warna full o' chapellin'--it's thy brother as
does iverything, for there's niver nobody else i' th' way to do
nothin'.''
Lisbeth was going on, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) was not at all afraid of Seth, and
usually poured into his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) ears all the querulousness which was
repressed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) awe of Adam. Seth had never in his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) life spoken a
harsh word to his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) mother, and timid people always wreak their
peevishness on the gentle. But Seth, with an anxious look, had
passed into the workshop and said, ``Addy, how's this? What!
Father's forgot the coffin?''
``Aye, lad, th' old tale; but I shall get it done,'' said Adam,
looking up and casting one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) bright keen glances at his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
brother. ``Why, what's the matter with thee? Thee 't in trouble.''
Seth's eyes were red, and there was a look of deep depression
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) mild face.
``Yes, Addy, but it's what must be borne, and can't be helped.
Why, thee 'st never been to the school, then?''
``School? No, that screw can wait,'' said Adam, hammering
away again.
<div class="bookquote">``Let me take my turn now, and do thee go to bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Seth.



<p/>59

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, lad, I'd rather go on, now I'm in harness. Thee 't help me
to carry it to Brox'on when it's done. I'll call thee up at sunrise. Go
and eat thy supper, and shut the door so as I mayn't hear Mother's
talk.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>Seth knew that Adam always meant what he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) said, and was not
to be persuaded into meaning anything else. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) turned, with
rather a heavy heart, into the house-place.
<div class="bookquote">``Adam's niver touched a bit o' victual sin' home he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'s come,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Lisbeth. <div class="bookquote">``I reckon thee 'st hed thy supper at some o' thy
Methody folks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Seth, <div class="bookquote">``I've had no supper yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Lisbeth, <div class="bookquote">``but donna thee ate the taters, for
Adam 'ull happen ate ’em if I leave ’em stannin'. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) loves a bit o'
taters an' gravy. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'s been so sore an' angered, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) wouldn't ate
’em, for all I'd putten ’em by o' purpose for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). An' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'s been athreatenin' to go away again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) went on, whimpering, <div class="bookquote">``an' I'm
fast sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'ll go some dawnin' afore I'm up, an' niver let me know
aforehand, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'ll niver come back again when once he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'s gone.
An' I'd better niver ha' had a son, as is like no other body's son for
the deftness an' th' handiness, an' so looked on by th' grit folks, an'
tall an' upright like a poplar-tree, an' me to be parted from him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) an'
niver see 'm no more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come, Mother, donna grieve thyself in vain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Seth, in a
soothing voice. ``Thee 'st not half so good reason to think as Adam
'ull go away as to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'ll stay with thee. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) may say such a
thing when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'s in wrath--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'s got excuse for being wrathful
sometimes--but his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) heart 'ud never let him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) go. Think how he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'s
stood by us all when it's been none so easy--paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) savings to
free me from going for a soldier, an' turnin' his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) earnin's into wood



<p/>60

<p/>for father, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'s got plenty o' uses for his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) money, and many a
young man like him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) 'ud ha' been married and settled before now.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'ll never turn round and knock down his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) own work, and forsake
them as it's been the labour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) life to stand by.''
``Donna talk to me about 's marr'in','' said Lisbeth, crying
afresh. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'s set's heart on that Hetty Sorrel, as 'ull niver save a
penny, an' 'ull toss up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>) head at's old mother. An' to think as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
might ha' Mary Burge, an' be took partners, an' be a big man wi'
workmen under him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), like Mester Burge--Dolly's told me so o’er
and o’er again--if it warna as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>)'s set's heart on that bit of a
wench, as is o' no more use nor the gillyflower on the wall. An' he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>)
so wise at bookin' an' figurin', an' not to know no better nor that!''
``But, Mother, thee know'st we canna love just where other
folks 'ud have us. There's nobody but God can control the heart of
man. I could ha' wished myself as Adam could ha' made another
choice, but I wouldn't reproach him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) can't help. And
I'm not sure but what he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) tries to o’ercome it. But it's a matter as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) doesn't like to be spoke to about, and I can only pray to the
Lord to bless and direct him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>).''
``Aye, thee 't allays ready enough at prayin', but I donna see as
thee gets much wi' thy prayin'. Thee wotna get double earnins o'
this side Yule. Th' Methodies 'll niver make thee half the man thy
brother is, for all they're a-makin' a preacher on thee.''
``It's partly truth thee speak'st there, Mother,'' said Seth, mildly;
``Adam's far before me, an's done more for me than I can ever do
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). God distributes talents to every man according as He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sees
good. But thee mustna undervally prayer. Prayer mayna bring
money, but it brings us what no money can buy--a power to keep
from sin and be content with God's will, whatever He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) may please



<p/>61

<p/>to send. If thee wouldst pray to God to help thee, and trust in His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
goodness, thee wouldstna be so uneasy about things.''
``Unaisy? I'm i' th' right on 't to be unaisy. It's well seen on thee
what it is niver to be unaisy. Thee 't gi' away all thy earnins, an'
niver be unaisy as thee 'st nothin' laid up again' a rainy day. If
Adam had been as aisy as thee, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'d niver ha' had no money to pay
for thee. Take no thought for the morrow--take no thought--that's
what thee 't allays sayin'; an' what comes on 't? Why, as Adam has
to take thought for thee.''
``Those are the words o' the Bible, Mother,'' said Seth. ``They
don't mean as we should be idle. They mean we shouldn't be
overanxious and worreting ourselves about what'll happen tomorrow, but do our duty and leave the rest to God's will.''
``Aye, aye, that's the way wi' thee: thee allays makes a peck o'
thy own words out o' a pint o' the Bible's. I donna see how thee 't
to know as 'take no thought for the morrow' means all that. An'
when the Bible's such a big book, an' thee canst read all thro't, an'
ha' the pick o' the texes, I canna think why thee dostna pick better
words as donna mean so much more nor they say. Adam doesna
pick a that’n; I can understan' the tex as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'s allays a-sayin', `God
helps them as helps theirsens.'''
<div class="bookquote">``Nay, Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Seth, <div class="bookquote">``that's no text o' the Bible. It comes
out of a book as Adam picked up at the stall at Treddles'on. It was
wrote by a knowing man, but overworldly, I doubt. However, that
saying's partly true; for the Bible tells us we must be workers
together with God.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>``Well, how'm I to know? It sounds like a tex.. But what's th'
matter wi' th' lad? Thee 't hardly atin' a bit o' supper. Dostna
mean to ha' no more nor that bit o' oat-cake? An' thee lookst as



<p/>62

<p/>white as a flick o' new bacon. What's th' matter wi' thee?''
``Nothing to mind about, Mother; I'm not hungry. I'll just look in
at Adam again, and see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'ll let me go on with the coffin.''
``Ha' a drop o' warm broth?'' said Lisbeth, whose motherly
feeling now got the better of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) ``nattering'' habit. ``I'll set twothree sticks a-light in a minute.''
``Nay, Mother, thank thee; thee 't very good,'' said Seth,
gratefully; and encouraged by this touch of tenderness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) went
on: ``Let me pray a bit with thee for Father, and Adam, and all of
us--it'll comfort thee, happen, more than thee thinkst.''
``Well, I've nothin' to say again' it.''
Lisbeth, though disposed always to take the negative side in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>)
conversations with Seth, had a vague sense that there was some
comfort and safety in the fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) piety, and that it somehow
relieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) from the trouble of any spiritual transactions on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>)
own behalf.
So the mother and son knelt down together, and Seth prayed
for the poor wandering father and for those who were sorrowing
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) at home. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) came to the petition that Adam
might never be called to set up his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) tent in a far country, but that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother might be cheered and comforted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) presence all the
days of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pilgrimage, Lisbeth's ready tears flowed again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
wept aloud.
When they rose from their knees, Seth went to Adam again and
said, ``Wilt only lie down for an hour or two, and let me go on the
while?''
<div class="bookquote">``No, Seth, no. Make Mother go to bed, and go thyself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Meantime Lisbeth had dried her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) eyes, and now followed Seth,
holding something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) hands. It was the brown-and-yellow



<p/>63

<p/>platter containing the baked potatoes with the gravy in them and
bits of meat which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) had cut and mixed among them. Those
were dear times, when wheaten bread and fresh meat were
delicacies to working people. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) set the dish down rather timidly
on the bench by Adam's side and said, <div class="bookquote">``Thee canst pick a bit while
thee 't workin'. I'll bring thee another drop o' water.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye, Mother, do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, kindly; <div class="bookquote">``I'm getting very
thirsty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>In half an hour all was quiet; no sound was to be heard in the
house but the loud ticking of the old day-clock and the ringing of
Adam's tools. The night was very still: when Adam opened the
door to look out at twelve o’clock, the only motion seemed to be in
the glowing, twinkling stars; every blade of grass was asleep.
Bodily haste and exertion usually leave our thoughts very much
at the mercy of our feelings and imagination; and it was so to-night
with Adam. While his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) muscles were working lustily, his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mind
seemed as passive as a spectator at a diorama: scenes of the sad
past, and probably sad future, floating before him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) and giving place
one to the other in swift sucession.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) saw how it would be to-morrow morning, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had
carried the coffin to Broxton and was at home again, having his (<font color='blue'><b>Broxton</b></font>)
breakfast: his (<font color='blue'><b>Broxton</b></font>) father perhaps would come in ashamed to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Broxton</b></font>)
son's glance--would sit down, looking older and more tottering
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Broxton</b></font>) had done the morning before, and hang down his (<font color='blue'><b>Broxton</b></font>) head,
examining the floor-quarries; while Lisbeth would ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Broxton</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Broxton</b></font>)
supposed the coffin had been got ready, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Broxton</b></font>) had slinked off
and left undone--for Lisbeth was always the first to utter the word
of reproach, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) cried at Adam's severity towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
father.



<p/>64

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So it will go on, worsening and worsening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>thought Adam;
<div class="bookquote">``there's no slipping uphill again, and no standing still when once
you've begun to slip down.''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>And then the day came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was a little fellow and used to run by his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father's side,
proud to be taken out to work, and prouder still to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father
boasting to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) fellow-workmen how <div class="bookquote">``the little chap had an
uncommon notion o' carpentering.''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>What a fine active fellow his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
father was then! When people asked Adam whose little lad he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had a sense of distinction as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``I'm Thias Bede's
lad.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was quite sure everybody knew Thias Bede--didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
make the wonderful pigeon-house at Broxton parsonage? Those
were happy days, especially when Seth, who was three years the
younger, began to go out working too, and Adam began to be a
teacher as well as a learner. But then came the days of sadness,
when Adam was someway on in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) teens, and Thias began to
loiter at the public-houses, and Lisbeth began to cry at home, and
to pour forth her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) plaints in the hearing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) sons. Adam
remembered well the night of shame and anguish when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) first
saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father quite wild and foolish, shouting a song out fitfully
among his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) drunken companions at the <div class="bookquote">``Waggon Overthrown.''  (<font color='red'><b>companions</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
had run away once when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was only eighteen, making his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) escape
in the morning twilight with a little blue bundle over his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) shoulder,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``mensuration book''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) pocket, and saying to himself
very decidedly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could bear the vexations of home no
longer--he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would go and seek his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) fortune, setting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) stick at
the crossways and bending his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) steps the way it fell. But by the
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) got to Stoniton, the thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother and Seth, left
behind to endure everything without him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), became too
importunate, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) resolution failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) came back the next



<p/>65

<p/>day, but the misery and terror his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother had gone through in
those two days had haunted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ever since.
<div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam said to himself to-night, <div class="bookquote">``that must never happen
again. It 'ud make a poor balance when my doings are cast up at
the last, if my poor old mother stood o' the wrong side. My back's
broad enough and strong enough; I should be no better than a
coward to go away and leave the troubles to be borne by them as
aren't half so able. `They that are strong ought to bear the
infirmities of those that are weak, and not to please themselves.'
There's a text wants no candle to show't; it shines by its own light.
It's plain enough you get into the wrong road i' this life if you run
after this and that only for the sake o' making things easy and
pleasant to yourself. A pig may poke his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) nose into the trough and
think o' nothing outside it; but if you've got a man's heart and soul
in you, you can't be easy a-making your own bed an' leaving the
rest to lie on the stones. Nay, nay, I'll never slip my neck out o' the
yoke, and leave the load to be drawn by the weak uns. Father's a
sore cross to me, an's likely to be for many a long year to come.
What then? I've got th' health, and the limbs, and the sperrit to
bear it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>At this moment a smart rap, as if with a willow wand, was given
at the house door, and Gyp, instead of barking, as might have been
expected, gave a loud howl. Adam, very much startled, went at
once to the door and opened it. Nothing was there; all was still, as
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) opened it an hour before; the leaves were motionless, and
the light of the stars showed the placid fields on both sides of the
brook quite empty of visible life. Adam walked round the house,
and still saw nothing except a rat which darted into the woodshed
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) passed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) went in again, wondering; the sound was so



<p/>66

<p/>peculiar that the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) heard it it called up the image of the
willow wand striking the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could not help a little shudder,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) remembered how often his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) of just such
a sound coming as a sign when some one was dying. Adam was
not a man to be gratuitously superstitious, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had the blood of
the peasant in him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) as well as of the artisan, and a peasant can no
more help believing in a traditional superstition than a horse can
help trembling when he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) sees a camel. Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) had that mental
combination which is at once humble in the region of mystery and
keen in the region of knowledge: it was the depth of his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) reverence
quite as much as his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) hard common sense which gave him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>)
disinclination to doctrinal religion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) often checked Seth's
argumentative spiritualism by saying, <div class="bookquote">``Eh, it's a big mystery; thee
know'st but little about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>And so it happened that Adam was at
once penetrating and credulous. If a new building had fallen down
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had been told that this was a divine judgment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would
have said, <div class="bookquote">``May be; but the bearing o' the roof and walls wasn't
right, else it wouldn't ha' come down'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) believed in dreams
and prognostics, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) dying day he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) bated his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) breath a little
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) told the story of the stroke with the willow wand. I tell it
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) told it, not attempting to reduce it to its natural elements--in
our eagerness to explain impressions, we often lose our hold of the
sympathy that comprehends them.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had the best antidote against imaginative dread in the
necessity for getting on with the coffin, and for the next ten
minutes his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hammer was ringing so uninterruptedly, that other
sounds, if there were any, might well be overpowered. A pause
came, however, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had to take up his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) ruler, and now again
came the strange rap, and again Gyp howled. Adam was at the



<p/>67

<p/>door without the loss of a moment; but again all was still, and the
starlight showed there was nothing but the dew-laden grass in
front of the cottage.
Adam for a moment thought uncomfortably about his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father;
but of late years he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had never come home at dark hours from
Treddleston, and there was every reason for believing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was
then sleeping off his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) drunkenness at the <div class="bookquote">``Waggon Overthrown.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Besides, to Adam, the conception of the future was so inseparable
from the painful image of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father that the fear of any fatal
accident to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was excluded by the deeply infixed fear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
continual degradation. The next thought that occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was
one that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) slip off his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) shoes and tread lightly upstairs, to
listen at the bedroom doors. But both Seth and his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) mother were
breathing regularly.
Adam came down and set to work again, saying to himself, <div class="bookquote">``I
won't open the door again. It's no use staring about to catch sight
of a sound. Maybe there's a world about us as we can't see, but th'
ear's quicker than the eye and catches a sound from 't now and
then. Some people think they get a sight on 't too, but they're
mostly folks whose eyes are not much use to ’em at anything else.
For my part, I think it's better to see when your perpendicular's
true than to see a ghost.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Such thoughts as these are apt to grow stronger and stronger as
daylight quenches the candles and the birds begin to sing. By the
time the red sunlight shone on the brass nails that formed the
initials on the lid of the coffin, any lingering foreboding from the
sound of the willow wand was merged in satisfaction that the work
was done and the promise redeemed. There was no need to call
Seth, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) was already moving overhead, and presently came



<p/>68

<p/>downstairs.
<div class="bookquote">``Now, lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, as Seth made his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) appearance, <div class="bookquote">``the
coffin's done, and we can take it over to Brox'on, and be back
again before half after six. I'll take a mouthful o' oat-cake, and
then we'll be off.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>The coffin was soon propped on the tall shoulders of the two
brothers, and they were making their way, followed close by Gyp,
out of the little woodyard into the lane at the back of the house. It
was but about a mile and a half to Broxton over the opposite slope,
and their road wound very pleasantly along lanes and across
fields, where the pale woodbines and the dog-roses were scenting
the hedgerows, and the birds were twittering and trilling in the tall
leafy boughs of oak and elm. It was a strangely mingled picture--
the fresh youth of the summer morning, with its Eden-like peace
and loveliness, the stalwart strength of the two brothers in their
rusty working clothes, and the long coffin on their shoulders. They
paused for the last time before a small farmhouse outside the
village of Broxton. By six o’clock the task was done the coffin
nailed down, and Adam and Seth were on their way home. They
chose a shorter way homewards, which would take them across
the fields and the brook in front of the house. Adam had not
mentioned to Seth what had happened in the night, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) still
retained sufficient impression from it himself to say, <div class="bookquote">``Seth, lad, if
Father isn't come home by the time we've had our breakfast, I
think it'll be as well for thee to go over to Treddles'on and look
after him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), and thee canst get me the brass wire I want. Never mind
about losing an hour at thy work; we can make that up. What dost
say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm willing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Seth. ``But see what clouds have gathered



<p/>69

<p/>since we set out. I'm thinking we shall have more rain. It'll be a
sore time for th' haymaking if the meadows are flooded again. The
brook's fine and full now: another day's rain 'ud cover the plank,
and we should have to go round by the road.''
They were coming across the valley now, and had entered the
pasture through which the brook ran.
``Why, what's that sticking against the willow?'' continued Seth,
beginning to walk faster. Adam's heart rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mouth: the
vague anxiety about his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father was changed into a great dread. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
made no answer to Seth, but ran forward preceded by Gyp, who
began to bark uneasily; and in two moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) was at the bridge.
This was what the omen meant, then! And the grey-haired
father, of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had thought with a sort of hardness a few
hours ago, as certain to live to be a thorn in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) side was perhaps
even then struggling with that watery death! This was the first
thought that flashed through Adam's conscience, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had
time to seize the coat and drag out the tall heavy body. Seth was
already by his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) side, helping him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>), and when they had it on the
bank, the two sons in the first moment knelt and looked with mute
awe at the glazed eyes, forgetting that there was need for action--
forgetting everything but that their father lay dead before them.
Adam was the first to speak.
``I'll run to Mother,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, in a loud whisper. <div class="bookquote">``I'll be back to
thee in a minute.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Poor Lisbeth was busy preparing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) sons' breakfast, and their
porridge was already steaming on the fire. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) kitchen always
looked the pink of cleanliness, but this morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) was more than
usually bent on making her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) hearth and breakfast-table look
comfortable and inviting.



<p/>70

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The lads 'ull be fine an' hungry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) said, half-aloud, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>)
stirred the porridge. <div class="bookquote">``It's a good step to Brox'on, an' it's hungry
air o’er the hill--wi' that heavy coffin too. Eh! It's heavier now, wi'
poor Bob Tholer in 't. Howiver, I've made a drap more porridge
nor common this mornin'. The feyther 'ull happen come in arter a
bit. Not as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'ll ate much porridge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) swallers sixpenn'orth o' ale,
an' saves a hap'orth o' por-ridge--that's his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) way o' layin' by
money, as I've told him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) many a time, an' am likely to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) again
afore the day's out. Eh, poor mon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) takes it quiet enough; there's
no denyin' that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>But now Lisbeth heard the heavy <div class="bookquote">``thud''  (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>of a running footstep
on the turf, and, turning quickly towards the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) saw Adam
enter, looking so pale and overwhelmed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) screamed aloud
and rushed towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had time to speak.
<div class="bookquote">``Hush, Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam said, rather hoarsely, <div class="bookquote">``don't be
frightened. Father's tumbled into the water. Belike we may bring
him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) round again. Seth and me are going to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) in. Get a
blanket and make it hot as the fire.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>In reality Adam was convinced that his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father was dead but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
knew there was no other way of repressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother's
impetuous wailing grief than by occupying her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with some active
task which had hope in it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) ran back to Seth, and the two sons lifted the sad burden in
heart-stricken silence. The wide-open glazed eyes were grey, like
Seth's, and had once looked with mild pride on the boys before
whom Thias had lived to hang his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) head in shame. Seth's chief
feeling was awe and distress at this sudden snatching away of his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)
father's soul; but Adam's mind rushed back over the past in a
flood of relenting and pity. When death, the great Reconciler, has



<p/>71

<p/>come, it is never our tenderness that we repent of, but our
severity.




<p/>72

<p/>Chapter V
The Rector

<p/>B

<p/>efore twelve o’clock there had been some heavy storms of
rain, and the water lay in deep gutters on the sides of the
gravel walks in the garden of Broxton Parsonage; the
great Provence roses had been cruelly tossed by the wind and
beaten by the rain, and all the delicate-stemmed border flowers
had been dashed down and stained with the wet soil. A
melancholy morning--because it was nearly time hay-harvest
should begin, and instead of that the meadows were likely to be
flooded.
But people who have pleasant homes get indoor enjoyments
that they would never think of but for the rain. If it had not been a
wet morning, Mr. Irwine would not have been in the dining-room
playing at chess with his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) mother, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) loves both his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) mother and
chess quite well enough to pass some cloudy hours very easily by
their help. Let me take you into that dining-room and show you
the Rev. Adolphus Irwine, Rector of Broxton, Vicar of Hayslope,
and Vicar of Blythe, a pluralist at whom the severest Church
reformer would have found it difficult to look sour. We will enter
very softly and stand still in the open doorway, without awaking
the glossy-brown setter who is stretched across the hearth, with
her (<font color='blue'><b>setter</b></font>) two puppies beside her (<font color='blue'><b>setter</b></font>); or the pug, who is dozing, with his (<font color='blue'><b>reformer</b></font>)
black muzzle aloft, like a sleepy president.
The room is a large and lofty one, with an ample mullioned oriel
window at one end; the walls, you see, are new, and not yet



<p/>73

<p/>painted; but the furniture, though originally of an expensive sort,
is old and scanty, and there is no drapery about the window. The
crimson cloth over the large dining-table is very threadbare,
though it contrasts pleasantly enough with the dead hue of the
plaster on the walls; but on this cloth there is a massive silver
waiter with a decanter of water on it, of the same pattern as two
larger ones that are propped up on the sideboard with a coat of
arms conspicuous in their centre. You suspect at once that the
inhabitants of this room have inherited more blood than wealth,
and would not be surprised to find that Mr. Irwine had a finely cut
nostril and upper lip; but at present we can only see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) has a
broad flat back and an abundance of powdered hair, all thrown
backward and tied behind with a black ribbon--a bit of
conservatism in costume which tells you that he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) is not a young
man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) will perhaps turn round by and by, and in the meantime
we can look at that stately old lady, his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) mother, a beautiful aged
brunette, whose rich-toned complexion is well set off by the
complex wrappings of pure white cambric and lace about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head
and neck. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is as erect in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) comely embonpoint as a statue of
Ceres; and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dark face, with its delicate aquiline nose, firm
proud mouth, and small, intense, black eye, is so keen and
sarcastic in its expression that you instinctively substitute a pack
of cards for the chess-men and imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) telling your fortune.
The small brown hand with which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) queen is laden
with pearls, diamonds, and turquoises; and a large black veil is
very carefully adjusted over the crown of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cap, and falls in
sharp contrast on the white folds about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) neck. It must take a
long time to dress that old lady in the morning! But it seems a law
of nature that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should be dressed so: she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is clearly one of those



<p/>74

<p/>children of royalty who have never doubted their right divine and
never met with any one so absurd as to question it.
<div class="bookquote">``There, Dauphin, tell me what that is!''  (<font color='red'><b>this lady</b></font>)</div>says this magnificent
old lady, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) deposits her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) queen very quietly and folds her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
arms. <div class="bookquote">``I should be sorry to utter a word disagreeable to your
feelings.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you witch-mother, you sorceress! How is a Christian man
to win a game off you? I should have sprinkled the board with holy
water before we began. You've not won that game by fair means,
now, so don't pretend it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, that's what the beaten have always said of great
conquerors. But see, there's the sunshine falling on the board, to
show you more clearly what a foolish move you made with that
pawn. Come, shall I give you another chance?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Mother, I shall leave you to your own conscience, now it's
clearing up. We must go and plash up the mud a little, mus’n’t we,
Juno?''  (<font color='red'><b>the setter</b></font>)</div>This was addressed to the brown setter, who had jumped
up at the sound of the voices and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nose in an insinuating
way on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) master's leg. <div class="bookquote">``But I must go upstairs first and see
Anne. I was called away to Tholer's funeral just when I was going
before.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's of no use, child; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) can't speak to you. Kate says she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) has
one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) worst headaches this morning.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) likes me to go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) just the same; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)'s never
too ill to care about that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>If you know how much of human speech is mere purposeless
impulse or habit, you will not wonder when I tell you that this
identical objection had been made, and had received the same
kind of answer, many hundred times in the course of the fifteen



<p/>75

<p/>years that Mr. Irwine's sister Anne had been an invalid. Splendid
old ladies, who take a long time to dress in the morning, have often
slight sympathy with sickly daughters.
But while Mr. Irwine was still seated, leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) chair
and stroking Juno's head, the servant came to the door and said,
<div class="bookquote">``If you please, sir, Joshua Rann wishes to speak with you, if you
are at liberty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) be shown in here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Irwine</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Irwine, taking up her (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
knitting. <div class="bookquote">``I always like to hear what Mr. Rann has got to say. His (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>)
shoes will be dirty, but see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) wipes them Carroll.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joshua/Joshua Rann/Mr. Rann</b></font>)</div>In two minutes Mr. Rann appeared at the door with very
deferential bows, which, however, were far from conciliating Pug,
who gave a sharp bark and ran across the room to reconnoitre the
stranger's legs; while the two puppies, regarding Mr. Rann's
prominent calf and ribbed worsted stockings from a more
sensuous point of view, plunged and growled over them in great
enjoyment. Meantime, Mr. Irwine turned round his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) chair and said,
<div class="bookquote">``Well, Joshua, anything the matter at Hayslope, that you've come
over this damp morning? Sit down, sit down. Never mind the
dogs; give them a friendly kick. Here, Pug, you rascal!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div>It is very pleasant to see some men turn round; pleasant as a
sudden rush of warm air in winter, or the flash of firelight in the
chill dusk. Mr. Irwine was one of those men. He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) bore the same sort
of resemblance to his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) mother that our loving memory of a friend's
face often bears to the face itself: the lines were all more generous,
the smile brighter, the expression heartier. If the outline had been
less finely cut, his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) face might have been called jolly; but that was
not the right word for its mixture of bonhomie and distinction.
<div class="bookquote">``Thank Your Reverence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joshua/Joshua Rann/Mr. Rann</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Rann, endeavouring to



<p/>76

<p/>look unconcerned about his (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) legs, but shaking them alternately to
keep off the puppies; <div class="bookquote">``I'll stand, if you please, as more becoming. I
hope I see you an' Mrs. Irwine well, an' Miss Irwine--an' Miss
Anne, I hope's as well as usual.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joshua/Joshua Rann/Mr. Rann</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Joshua, thank you. You see how blooming my mother
looks. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) beats us younger people hollow. But what's the
matter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, sir, I had to come to Brox'on to deliver some work, and I
thought it but right to call and let you know the goins-on as there's
been i' the village, such as I hanna seen i' my time, and I've lived
in it man and boy sixty year come St. Thomas, and collected th'
Easter dues for Mr. Blick before Your Reverence come into the
parish, and been at the ringin' o' every bell, and the diggin' o'
every grave, and sung i' the choir long afore Bartle Massey come
from nobody knows where, wi' his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) counter-singin' and fine
anthems, as puts everybody out but himself--one takin' it up after
another like sheep a-bleatin' i' th' fold. I know what belongs to
bein' a parish clerk, and I know as I should be wantin' i' respect to
Your Reverence, an' church, an' king, if I was t' allow such goinson wi’out speakin'. I was took by surprise, an' knowed nothin' on it
beforehand, an' I was so flustered, I was clean as if I'd lost my
tools. I hanna slep' more nor four hour this night as is past an'
gone; an' then it was nothin' but nightmare, as tired me worse nor

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, what in the world is the matter, Joshua? Have the
thieves been at the church lead again?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Thieves! No, sir--an' yet, as I may say, it is thieves, an' athievin' the church, too. It's the Methodisses as is like to get th'
upper hand i' th' parish, if Your Reverence an' His (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>) Honour, Squire



<p/>77

<p/>Donnithorne, doesna think well to say the word an' forbid it. Not
as I'm a-dictatin' to you, sir; I'm not forgettin' myself so far as to be
wise above my betters. Howiver, whether I'm wise or no, that's
neither here nor there, but what I've got to say I say--as the young
Methodis woman as is at Mester Poyser's was a-preachin' an' aprayin' on the Green last night, as sure as I'm a-stannin' afore
Your Reverence now.''
``Preaching on the Green!'' said Mr. Irwine, looking surprised
but quite serene. ``What, that pale pretty young woman I've seen
at Poyser's? I saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was a Methodist, or Quaker, or something of
that sort, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) dress, but I didn't know she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was a preacher.''
``It's a true word as I say, sir,'' rejoined Mr. Rann, compressing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) mouth into a semicircular form and pausing long enough to
indicate three notes of exclamation. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) preached on the Green
last night; an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)'s laid hold of Chad's Bess, as the girl's been i'
fits welly iver sin'.''
``Well, Bessy Cranage is a hearty-looking lass; I daresay she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>)'ll
come round again, Joshua. Did anybody else go into fits?''
``No, sir, I canna say as they did. But there's no knowin' what'll
come, if we're t' have such preachin's as that a-goin' on ivery
week--there'll be no livin' i' th' village. For them Methodisses
make folks believe as if they take a mug o' drink extry, an' make
theirselves a bit comfortable, they'll have to go to hell for 't as sure
as they're born. I'm not a tipplin' man nor a drunkard--nobody
can say it on me--but I like a extry quart at Easter or Christmas
time, as is nat'ral when we're goin' the rounds a-singin', an' folks
offer 't you for nothin'; or when I'm a-collectin' the dues; an' I like
a pint wi' my pipe, an' a neighbourly chat at Mester Casson's now
an' then, for I was brought up i' the Church, thank God, an' ha'



<p/>78

<p/>been a parish clerk this two-an'-thirty year: I should know what
the church religion is.''
``Well, what's your advice, Joshua? What do you think should
be done?''
``Well, Your Reverence, I'm not for takin' any measures again'
the young woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s well enough if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d let alone preachin';
an' I hear as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s a-goin' away back to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own country soon.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s Mr. Poyser's own niece, an' I donna wish to say what's
anyways disrespectful o' th' family at th' Hall Farm, as I've
measured for shoes, little an' big, welly iver sin' I've been a
shoemaker. But there's that Will Maskery, sir as is the
rampageousest Methodis as can be, an' I make no doubt it was
him (<font color='blue'><b>Maskery</b></font>) as stirred up th' young woman to preach last night, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Maskery</b></font>)'ll be
a-bringin' other folks to preach from Treddles'on, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Maskery</b></font>) comb isn't
cut a bit; an' I think as he (<font color='blue'><b>Maskery</b></font>) should be let know as he (<font color='blue'><b>Maskery</b></font>) isna t' have the
makin' an' mendin' o' church carts an' implemen's, let alone
stayin' i' that house an' yard as is Squire Donnithorne's.''
``Well, but you say yourself, Joshua, that you never knew any
one come to preach on the Green before; why should you think
they'll come again? The Methodists don't come to preach in little
villages like Hayslope, where there's only a handful of labourers,
too tired to listen to them. They might almost as well go and
preach on the Binton Hills. Will Maskery is no preacher himself, I
think.''
``Nay, sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maskery</b></font>)'s no gift at stringin' the words together wi’out
book; he (<font color='blue'><b>Maskery</b></font>)'d be stuck fast like a cow i' wet clay. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Maskery</b></font>)'s got tongue
enough to speak disrespectful about's neebors, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Maskery</b></font>) said as I was
a blind Pharisee--a-usin' the Bible i' that way to find nick-names
for folks as are his (<font color='blue'><b>Maskery</b></font>) elders an' betters!--and what's worse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maskery</b></font>)'s been



<p/>79

<p/>heard to say very unbecomin' words about Your Reverence; for I
could bring them as 'ud swear as he (<font color='blue'><b>Maskery</b></font>) called you a `dumb dog,' an' a
`idle shepherd.' You'll forgi’e me for sayin' such things over
again.''
``Better not, better not, Joshua. Let evil words die as soon as
they're spoken. Will Maskery might be a great deal worse fellow
than he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) used to be a wild drunken rascal, neglecting his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
work and beating his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wife, they told me; now he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s thrifty and
decent, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wife look comfortable together. If you can
bring me any proof that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) interferes with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) neighbours and
creates any disturbance, I shall think it my duty as a clergyman
and a magistrate to interfere. But it wouldn't become wise people
like you and me to be making a fuss about trifles, as if we thought
the Church was in danger because Will Maskery lets his (<font color='blue'><b>Maskery</b></font>) tongue
wag rather foolishly, or a young woman talks in a serious way to a
handful of people on the Green. We must `live and let live,' Joshua,
in religion as well as in other things. You go on doing your duty, as
parish clerk and sexton, as well as you've always done it, and
making those capital thick boots for your neighbours, and things
won't go far wrong in Hayslope, depend upon it.''
``Your reverence is very good to say so; an' I'm sensable as, you
not livin' i' the parish, there's more upo' my shoulders.''
``To be sure; and you must mind and not lower the Church in
people's eyes by seeming to be frightened about it for a little thing,
Joshua. I shall trust to your good sense, now to take no notice at all
of what Will Maskery says, either about you or me. You and your
neighbours can go on taking your pot of beer soberly, when you've
done your day's work, like good churchmen; and if Will Maskery
doesn't like to join you, but to go to a prayer-meeting at



<p/>80

<p/>Treddleston instead, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Maskery</b></font>); that's no business of yours, so long as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Maskery</b></font>) doesn't hinder you from doing what you like. And as to people
saying a few idle words about us, we must not mind that, any more
than the old church-steeple minds the rooks cawing about it. Will
Maskery comes to church every Sunday afternoon, and does his (<font color='blue'><b>Maskery</b></font>)
wheelwright's business steadily in the weekdays, and as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Maskery</b></font>)
does that he (<font color='blue'><b>Maskery</b></font>) must be let alone.''
``Ah, sir, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Maskery</b></font>) comes to church, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maskery</b></font>) sits an' shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>Maskery</b></font>)
head, an' looks as sour an' as coxy when we're a-singin' as I should
like to fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Maskery</b></font>) a rap across the jowl--God forgi’e me--an' Mrs.
Irwine, an' Your Reverence too, for speakin' so afore you. An' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
said as our Christmas singin' was no better nor the cracklin' o'
thorns under a pot.''
``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s got a bad ear for music, Joshua. When people have
wooden heads, you know, it can't be helped. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>) won't bring the
other people in Hayslope round to his (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>) opinion, while you go on
singing as well as you do.''
``Yes, sir, but it turns a man's stomach t' hear the Scripture
misused i' that way. I know as much o' the words o' the Bible as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
does, an' could say the Psalms right through i' my sleep if you was
to pinch me; but I know better nor to take ’em to say my own say
wi'. I might as well take the Sacriment-cup home and use it at
meals.''
<div class="bookquote">``That's a very sensible remark of yours, Joshua; but, as I said
before--''
 (<font color='red'><b>tenor</b></font>)</div>While Mr. Irwine was speaking, the sound of a booted step and
the clink of a spur were heard on the stone floor of the entrancehall, and Joshua Rann moved hastily aside from the doorway to
make room for some one who paused there, and said, in a ringing



<p/>81

<p/>tenor voice,
<div class="bookquote">``Godson Arthur--may he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) come in?''
 (<font color='red'><b>tenor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come in, come in, godson!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Irwine</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Irwine answered, in the deep
half-masculine tone which belongs to the vigorous old woman, and
there entered a young gentleman in a riding-dress, with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) right
arm in a sling; whereupon followed that pleasant confusion of
laughing interjections, and hand-shakings, and <div class="bookquote">``How are you's?''
 (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>mingled with joyous short barks and wagging of tails on the part of
the canine members of the family, which tells that the visitor is on
the best terms with the visited. The young gentleman was Arthur
Donnithorne, known in Hayslope, variously, as <div class="bookquote">``the young
squire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``the heir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``the captain.''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) was only a captain in the
Loamshire Militia, but to the Hayslope tenants he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) was more
intensely a captain than all the young gentlemen of the same rank
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) Majesty's regulars--he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) outshone them as the planet Jupiter
outshines the Milky Way. If you want to know more particularly
how he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) looked, call to your remembrance some tawny-whiskered,
brown-locked, clear-complexioned young Englishman whom you
have met with in a foreign town, and been proud of as a fellowcountryman--well-washed, high-bred, white-handed, yet looking
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) could deliver well from 'the left shoulder and floor his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>)
man: I will not be so much of a tailor as to trouble your
imagination with the difference of costume, and insist on the
striped waistcoat, long-tailed coat, and low top-boots.
Turning round to take a chair, Captain Donnithorne said, <div class="bookquote">``But
don't let me interrupt Joshua's business--he (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>) has something to
say.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Donnithorne/Squire Donnithorne/Squire</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Humbly begging your honour's pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joshua/Joshua Rann/Mr. Rann</b></font>)</div>said Joshua, bowing
low, ``there was one thing I had to say to his (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>) reverence as other



<p/>82

<p/>things had drove out o' my head.''
``Out with it, Joshua, quickly!'' said Mr. Irwine.
``Belike, sir, you havena heared as Thias Bede's dead--
drownded this morning, or more like overnight, i' the Willow
Brook, again' the bridge right i' front o' the house.''
``Ah!'' exclaimed both the gentlemen at once, as if they were a
good deal interested in the information.
``An' Seth Bede's been to me this morning to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) wished me
to tell Your Reverence as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) brother Adam begged of you
particular t' allow his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father's grave to be dug by the White Thorn,
because his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorn</b></font>) mother's set her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart on it, on account of a dream as
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had; an' they'd ha' come theirselves to ask you, but they've so
much to see after with the crowner, an' that; an' their mother's
took on so, an' wants ’em to make sure o' the spot for fear
somebody else should take it. An' if Your Reverence sees well and
good, I'll send my boy to tell ’em as soon as I get home; an' that's
why I make bold to trouble you wi' it, His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Honour being present.''
``To be sure, Joshua, to be sure, they shall have it. I'll ride round
to Adam myself, and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). Send your boy, however, to say they
shall have the grave, lest anything should happen to detain me.
And now, good morning, Joshua; go into the kitchen and have
some ale.''
``Poor old Thias!'' said Mr. Irwine, when Joshua was gone. ``I'm
afraid the drink helped the brook to drown him (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>). I should have
been glad for the load to have been taken off my friend Adam's
shoulders in a less painful way. That fine fellow has been propping
up his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) father from ruin for the last five or six years.''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s a regular trump, is Adam,'' said Captain Donnithorne.
``When I was a little fellow, and Adam was a strapping lad of



<p/>83

<p/>fifteen, and taught me carpentering, I used to think if ever I was a
rich sultan, I would make Adam my grand-vizier. And I believe
now he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would bear the exaltation as well as any poor wise man in
an Eastern story. If ever I live to be a large-acred man instead of a
poor devil with a mortgaged allowance of pocket-money, I'll have
Adam for my right hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) shall manage my woods for me, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
seems to have a better notion of those things than any man I ever
met with; and I know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would make twice the money of them that
my grandfather does, with that miserable old Satchell to manage,
who understands no more about timber than an old carp. I've
mentioned the subject to my grandfather once or twice, but for
some reason or other he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) has a dislike to Adam, and I can do
nothing. But come, Your Reverence, are you for a ride with me?
It's splendid out of doors now. We can go to Adam's together, if
you like; but I want to call at the Hall Farm on my way, to look at
the whelps Poyser is keeping for me.''
``You must stay and have lunch first, Arthur,'' said Mrs. Irwine.
``It's nearly two. Carroll will bring it in directly.''
``I want to go to the Hall Farm too,'' said Mr. Irwine, ``to have
another look at the little Methodist who is staying there. Joshua
tells me she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was preaching on the Green last night.''
``Oh, by Jove!'' said Captain Donnithorne, laughing. ``Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
looks as quiet as a mouse. There's something rather striking about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>), though. I positively felt quite bashful the first time I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)--
she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was sitting stooping over her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) sewing in the sunshine outside
the house, when I rode up and called out, without noticing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
was a stranger, `Is Martin Poyser at home?' I declare, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
got up and looked at me and just said, `He (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)'s in the house, I believe:
I'll go and call him (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>),' I felt quite ashamed of having spoken so



<p/>84

<p/>abruptly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) looked like St. Catherine in a Quaker dress.
It's a type of face one rarely sees among our common people.''
``I should like to see the young woman, Dauphin,'' said Mrs.
Irwine. ``Make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) come here on some pretext or other.''
``I don't know how I can manage that, Mother; it will hardly do
for me to patronise a Methodist preacher, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) would
consent to be patronised by an idle shepherd, as Will Maskery
calls me. You should have come in a little sooner, Arthur, to hear
Joshua's denunciation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) neighbour Will Maskery. The old
fellow wants me to excommunicate the wheelwright, and then
deliver him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) over to the civil arm--that is to say, to your
grandfather--to be turned out of house and yard. If I chose to
interfere in this business, now, I might get up as pretty a story of
hatred and persecution as the Methodists need desire to publish in
the next number of their magazine. It wouldn't take me much
trouble to persuade Chad Cranage and half a dozen other bullheaded fellows that they would be doing an acceptable service to
the Church by hunting Will Maskery out of the village with ropeends and pitchforks; and then, when I had furnished them with
half a sovereign to get gloriously drunk after their exertions, I
should have put the climax to as pretty a farce as any of my
brother clergy have set going in their parishes for the last thirty
years.''
``It is really insolent of the man, though, to call you an `idle
shepherd' and a `dumb dog,''' said Mrs. Irwine. <div class="bookquote">``I should be
inclined to check him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) a little there. You are too easy-tempered,
Dauphin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Will Maskery</b></font>)</div>``Why, Mother, you don't think it would be a good way of
sustaining my dignity to set about vindicating myself from the



<p/>85

<p/>aspersions of Will Maskery? Besides, I'm not so sure that they are
aspersions. I am a lazy fellow, and get terribly heavy in my saddle;
not to mention that I'm always spending more than I can afford in
bricks and mortar, so that I get savage at a lame beggar when he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)
asks me for sixpence. Those poor lean cobblers, who think they
can help to regenerate mankind by setting out to preach in the
morning twilight before they begin their day's work, may well
have a poor opinion of me. But come, let us have our luncheon.
Isn't Kate coming to lunch?''
``Miss Irwine told Bridget to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) lunch upstairs,'' said
Carroll; ``she (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) can't leave Miss Anne.''
``Oh, very well. Tell Bridget to say I'll go up and see Miss Anne
presently. You can use your right arm quite well now, Arthur,'' Mr.
Irwine continued, observing that Captain Donnithorne had taken
his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) arm out of the sling.
``Yes, pretty well; but Godwin insists on my keeping it up
constantly for some time to come. I hope I shall be able to get away
to the regiment, though, in the beginning of August. It's a
desperately dull business being shut up at the Chase in the
summer months, when one can neither hunt nor shoot, so as to
make one's self pleasantly sleepy in the evening. However, we are
to astonish the echoes on the 30th of July. My grandfather has
given me carte blanche for once, and I promise you the
entertainment shall be worthy of the occasion. The world will not
see the grand epoch of my majority twice. I think I shall have a
lofty throne for you, Godmamma, or rather two, one on the lawn
and another in the ballroom, that you may sit and look down upon
us like an Olympian goddess.''
``I mean to bring out my best brocade, that I wore at your



<p/>86

<p/>christening twenty years ago,'' said Mrs. Irwine. ``Ah, I think I
shall see your poor mother flitting about in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) white dress, which
looked to me almost like a shroud that very day; and it was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
shroud only three months after; and your little cap and christening
dress were buried with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) too. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had set her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart on that,
sweet soul! Thank God you take after your mother's family,
Arthur. If you had been a puny, wiry, yellow baby, I wouldn't have
stood godmother to you. I should have been sure you would turn
out a Donnithorne. But you were such a broad-faced, broadchested, loud-screaming rascal, I knew you were every inch of you
a Tradgett.''
``But you might have been a little too hasty there, Mother,'' said
Mr. Irwine, smiling. ``Don't you remember how it was with Juno's
last pups? One of them was the very image of its mother, but it
had two or three of its father's tricks notwithstanding. Nature is
clever enough to cheat even you, Mother.''
``Nonsense, child! Nature never makes a ferret in the shape of a
mastiff. You'll never persuade me that I can't tell what men are by
their outsides. If I don't like a man's looks, depend upon it I shall
never like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I don't want to know people that look ugly and
disagreeable, any more than I want to taste dishes that look
disagreeable. If they make me shudder at the first glance, I say,
take them away. An ugly, piggish, or fishy eye, now, makes me feel
quite ill; it's like a bad smell.''
``Talking of eyes,'' said Captain Donnithorne, ``that reminds me
that I've got a book I meant to bring you, Godmamma. It came
down in a parcel from London the other day. I know you are fond
of queer, wizard-like stories. It's a volume of poems, `Lyrical
Ballads.' Most of them seem to be twaddling stuff, but the first is in



<p/>87

<p/>a different style--`The Ancient Mariner' is the title. I can hardly
make head or tail of it as a story, but it's a strange, striking thing.
I'll send it over to you; and there are some other books that you
may like to see, Irwine--pamphlets about Antinomianism and
Evangelicalism, whatever they may be. I can't think what the
fellow means by sending such things to me. I've written to him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) to
desire that from henceforth he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) will send me no book or pamphlet
on anything that ends in ism.''
``Well, I don't know that I'm very fond of isms myself; but I may
as well look at the pamphlets; they let one see what is going on.
I've a little matter to attend to, Arthur,'' continued Mr. Irwine,
rising to leave the room, ``and then I shall be ready to set out with
you.''
The little matter that Mr. Irwine had to attend to took him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) up
the old stone staircase -LRB-part of the house was very old-RRB- and made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) pause before a door at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) knocked gently. ``Come in,''
said a woman's voice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) entered a room so darkened by
blinds and curtains that Miss Kate, the thin middle-aged lady
standing by the bedside, would not have had light enough for any
other sort of work than the knitting which lay on the little table
near her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). But at present she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was doing what required only the
dimmest light--sponging the aching head that lay on the pillow
with fresh vinegar. It was a small face, that of the poor sufferer;
perhaps it had once been pretty, but now it was worn and sallow.
Miss Kate came towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother and whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Don't speak
to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) can't bear to be spoken to to-day.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Anne's eyes were
closed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brow contracted as if from intense pain. Mr. Irwine
went to the bedside and took up one of the delicate hands and
kissed it, a slight pressure from the small fingers told him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) that it



<p/>88

<p/>was worth-while to have come upstairs for the sake of doing that.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) lingered a moment, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), and then turned away and
left the room, treading very gently--he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) had taken off his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) boots and
put on slippers before he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) came upstairs. Whoever remembers how
many things he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) has declined to do even for himself, rather than
have the trouble of putting on or taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) boots, will not think
this last detail insignificant.
And Mr. Irwine's sisters, as any person of family within ten
miles of Broxton could have testified, were such stupid,
uninteresting women! It was quite a pity handsome, clever Mrs.
Irwine should have had such commonplace daughters. That fine
old lady herself was worth driving ten miles to see, any day; her (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
beauty, her (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) well-preserved faculties, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) old-fashioned dignity
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) a graceful subject for conversation in turn with the
King's health, the sweet new patterns in cotton dresses, the news
from Egypt, and Lord Dacey's lawsuit, which was fretting poor
Lady Dacey to death. But no one ever thought of mentioning the
Miss Irwines, except the poor people in Broxton village, who
regarded them as deep in the science of medicine, and spoke of
them vaguely as <div class="bookquote">``the gentlefolks.''  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>If any one had asked old Job
Dummilow who gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Dacey</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Dacey</b></font>) flannel jacket, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dacey</b></font>) would have
answered, <div class="bookquote">``the gentlefolks, last winter'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; and widow Steene dwelt
much on the virtues of the <div class="bookquote">``stuff''  (<font color='red'><b>widow</b></font>)</div>the gentlefolks gave her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
cough. Under this name too, they were used with great effect as a
means of taming refractory children, so that at the sight of poor
Miss Anne's sallow face, several small urchins had a terrified sense
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was cognisant of all their worst misdemeanours, and
knew the precise number of stones with which they had intended
to hit Farmer Britton's ducks. But for all who saw them through a



<p/>89

<p/>less mythical medium, the Miss Irwines were quite superfluous
existences--inartistic figures crowding the canvas of life without
adequate effect. Miss Anne, indeed, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) chronic headaches could
have been accounted for by a pathetic story of disappointed love,
might have had some romantic interest attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>): but no
such story had either been known or invented concerning her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and
the general impression was quite in accordance with the fact, that
both the sisters were old maids for the prosaic reason that they
had never received an eligible offer.
Nevertheless, to speak paradoxically, the existence of
insignificant people has very important consequences in the
world. It can be shown to affect the price of bread and the rate of
wages, to call forth many evil tempers from the selfish and many
heroisms from the sympathetic, and, in other ways, to play no
small part in the tragedy of life. And if that handsome, generousblooded clergyman, the Rev. Adolphus Irwine, had not had these
two hopelessly maiden sisters, his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) lot would have been shaped
quite differently: he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) would very likely have taken a comely wife in
his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) youth, and now, when his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) hair was getting grey under the
powder, would have had tall sons and blooming daughters--such
possessions, in short, as men commonly think will repay them for
all the labour they take under the sun. As it was--having with all
his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) three livings no more than seven hundred a-year, and seeing
no way of keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) splendid mother and his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) sickly sister, not to
reckon a second sister, who was usually spoken of without any
adjective, in such ladylike ease as became their birth and habits,
and at the same time providing for a family of his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) own--he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
remained, you see, at the age of eight-and-forty, a bachelor, not
making any merit of that renunciation, but saying laughingly, if



<p/>90

<p/>any one alluded to it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) made it an excuse for many
indulgences which a wife would never have allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>). And
perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) was the only person in the world who did not think his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>)
sisters uninteresting and superfluous; for his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) was one of those
large-hearted, sweet-blooded natures that never know a narrow or
a grudging thought; Epicurean, if you will, with no enthusiasm, no
self-scourging sense of duty; but yet, as you have seen, of a
sufficiently subtle moral fibre to have an unwearying tenderness
for obscure and monotonous suffering. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) large-hearted
indulgence that made him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) ignore his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) mother's hardness towards
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughters, which was the more striking from its contrast with
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) doting fondness towards himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) held it no virtue to frown
at irremediable faults.
See the difference between the impression a man makes on you
when you walk by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side in familiar talk, or look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
home, and the figure he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) makes when seen from a lofty historical
level, or even in the eyes of a critical neighbour who thinks of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
as an embodied system or opinion rather than as a man. Mr. Roe,
the <div class="bookquote">``travelling preacher''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Roe</b></font>)</div>stationed at Treddleston, had included
Mr. Irwine in a general statement concerning the Church clergy in
the surrounding district, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) described as men given up to
the lusts of the flesh and the pride of life; hunting and shooting,
and adorning their own houses; asking what shall we eat, and
what shall we drink, and wherewithal shall we be clothed?--
careless of dispensing the bread of life to their flocks, preaching at
best but a carnal and soul-benumbing morality, and trafficking in
the souls of men by receiving money for discharging the pastoral
office in parishes where they did not so much as look on the faces
of the people more than once a-year. The ecclesiastical historian,



<p/>91

<p/>too, looking into parliamentary reports of that period, finds
honourable members zealous for the Church, and untainted with
any sympathy for the <div class="bookquote">``tribe of canting Methodists,''  (<font color='red'><b>members</b></font>)</div>making
statements scarcely less melancholy than that of Mr. Roe. And it is
impossible for me to say that Mr. Irwine was altogether belied by
the generic classification assigned him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) really had no very lofty
aims, no theological enthusiasm: if I were closely questioned, I
should be obliged to confess that he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) felt no serious alarms about
the souls of his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) parishioners, and would have thought it a mere
loss of time to talk in a doctrinal and awakening manner to old
<div class="bookquote">``Feyther Taft,''  (<font color='red'><b>parishioners</b></font>)</div>or even to Chad Cranage the blacksmith. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Cranage</b></font>) had
been in the habit of speaking theoretically, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cranage</b></font>) would perhaps have
said that the only healthy form religion could take in such minds
was that of certain dim but strong emotions, suffusing themselves
as a hallowing influence over the family affections and
neighbourly duties. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cranage</b></font>) thought the custom of baptism more
important than its doctrine, and that the religious benefits the
peasant drew from the church where his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) fathers worshipped and
the sacred piece of turf where they lay buried were but slightly
dependent on a clear understanding of the Liturgy or the sermon.
Clearly the rector was not what is called in these days an <div class="bookquote">``earnest''
 (<font color='red'><b>the rector</b></font>)</div>man: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was fonder of church history than of divinity, and had
much more insight into men's characters than interest in their
opinions; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was neither laborious, nor obviously self-denying, nor
very copious in alms-giving, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) theology, you perceive, was
lax. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mental palate, indeed, was rather pagan, and found a
savouriness in a quotation from Sophocles or Theocritus that was
quite absent from any text in Isaiah or Amos. But if you feed your
young setter on raw flesh, how can you wonder at its retaining a



<p/>92

<p/>relish for uncooked partridge in after-life? And Mr. Irwine's
recollections of young enthusiasm and ambition were all
associated with poetry and ethics that lay aloof from the Bible.
On the other hand, I must plead, for I have an affectionate
partiality towards the rector's memory, that he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) was not
vindictive--and some philanthropists have been so; that he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) was
not intolerant--and there is a rumour that some zealous
theologians have not been altogether free from that blemish; that
although he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) would probably have declined to give his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) body to be
burned in any public cause, and was far from bestowing all his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>)
goods to feed the poor, he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) had that charity which has sometimes
been lacking to very illustrious virtue--he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) was tender to other
men's failings, and unwilling to impute evil. He (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) was one of those
men, and they are not the commonest, of whom we can know the
best only by following them away from the marketplace, the
platform, and the pulpit, entering with them into their own homes,
hearing the voice with which they speak to the young and aged
about their own hearthstone, and witnessing their thoughtful care
for the everyday wants of everyday companions, who take all their
kindness as a matter of course, and not as a subject for panegyric.
Such men, happily, have lived in times when great abuses
flourished, and have sometimes even been the living
representatives of the abuses. That is a thought which might
comfort us a little under the opposite fact--that it is better
sometimes not to follow great reformers of abuses beyond the
threshold of their homes.
But whatever you may think of Mr. Irwine now, if you had met
him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) that June afternoon riding on his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) grey cob, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) dogs
running beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)--portly, upright, manly, with a good-natured



<p/>93

<p/>smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) finely turned lips as he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) talked to his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) dashing young
companion on the bay mare, you must have felt that, however ill
he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) harmonised with sound theories of the clerical office, he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
somehow harmonised extremely well with that peaceful
landscape.
See them in the bright sunlight, interrupted every now and
then by rolling masses of cloud, ascending the slope from the
Broxton side, where the tall gables and elms of the rectory
predominate over the tiny whitewashed church. They will soon be
in the parish of Hayslope; the grey church-tower and village roofs
lie before them to the left, and farther on, to the right, they can
just see the chimneys of the Hall Farm.




<p/>94

<p/>Chapter VI
The Hall Farm

<p/>E

<p/>vidently that gate is never opened, for the long grass and
the great hemlocks grow close against it, and if it were
opened, it is so rusty that the force necessary to turn it on
its hinges would be likely to pull down the square stone-built
pillars, to the detriment of the two stone lionesses which grin with
a doubtful carnivorous affability above a coat of arms surmounting
each of the pillars. It would be easy enough, by the aid of the nicks
in the stone pillars, to climb over the brick wall with its smooth
stone coping; but by putting our eyes close to the rusty bars of the
gate, we can see the house well enough, and all but the very
corners of the grassy enclosure.
It is a very fine old place, of red brick, softened by a pale
powdery lichen, which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity,
so as to bring the red brick into terms of friendly companionship
with the limestone ornaments surrounding the three gables, the
windows, and the door-place. But the windows are patched with
wooden panes, and the door, I think, is like the gate--it is never
opened. How it would groan and grate against the stone floor if it
were! For it is a solid, heavy, handsome door, and must once have
been in the habit of shutting with a sonorous bang behind a
liveried lackey, who had just seen his (<font color='blue'><b>lackey</b></font>) master and mistress off the
grounds in a carriage and pair.
But at present one might fancy the house in the early stage of a
chancery suit, and that the fruit from that grand double row of




<p/>95

<p/>walnut-trees on the right hand of the enclosure would fall and rot
among the grass, if it were not that we heard the booming bark of
dogs echoing from great buildings at the back. And now the halfweaned calves that have been sheltering themselves in a gorsebuilt hovel against the left-hand wall come out and set up a silly
answer to that terrible bark, doubtless supposing that it has
reference to buckets of milk.
Yes, the house must be inhabited, and we will see by whom; for
imagination is a licensed trespasser: it has no fear of dogs, but may
climb over walls and peep in at windows with impunity. Put your
face to one of the glass panes in the right-hand window: what do
you see? A large open fireplace, with rusty dogs in it, and a bare
boarded floor; at the far end, fleeces of wool stacked up; in the
middle of the floor, some empty corn-bags. That is the furniture of
the dining-room. And what through the left-hand window?
Several clothes-horses, a pillion, a spinning-wheel, and an old box
wide open and stuffed full of coloured rags. At the edge of this box
there lies a great wooden doll, which, so far as mutilation is
concerned, bears a strong resemblance to the finest Greek
sculpture, and especially in the total loss of its nose. Near it there
is a little chair, and the butt end of a boy's leather long-lashed
whip.
The history of the house is plain now. It was once the residence
of a country squire, whose family, probably dwindling down to
mere spinsterhood, got merged in the more territorial name of
Donnithorne. It was once the Hall; it is now the Hall Farm. Like
the life in some coast town that was once a watering-place, and is
now a port, where the genteel streets are silent and grass-grown,
and the docks and warehouses busy and resonant, the life at the



<p/>96

<p/>Hall has changed its focus, and no longer radiates from the
parlour, but from the kitchen and the farmyard.
Plenty of life there, though this is the drowsiest time of the year,
just before hay-harvest; and it is the drowsiest time of the day too,
for it is close upon three by the sun, and it is half-past three by
Mrs. Poyser's handsome eight-day clock. But there is always a
stronger sense of life when the sun is brilliant after rain; and now
he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) is pouring down his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) beams, and making sparkles among the
wet straw, and lighting up every patch of vivid green moss on the
red tiles of the cow-shed, and turning even the muddy water that
is hurrying along the channel to the drain into a mirror for the
yellow-billed ducks, who are seizing the opportunity of getting a
drink with as much body in it as possible. There is quite a concert
of noises; the great bull-dog, chained against the stables, is thrown
into furious exasperation by the unwary approach of a cock too
near the mouth of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) kennel, and sends forth a thundering bark,
which is answered by two fox-hounds shut up in the opposite cowhouse; the old top-knotted hens, scratching with their chicks
among the straw, set up a sympathetic croaking as the discomfited
cock joins them; a sow with her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) brood, all very muddy as to the
legs, and curled as to the tail, throws in some deep staccato notes;
our friends the calves are bleating from the home croft; and, under
all, a fine ear discerns the continuous hum of human voices.
For the great barn-doors are thrown wide open, and men are
busy there mending the harness, under the superintendence of
Mr. Goby, the <div class="bookquote">``whittaw,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>otherwise saddler, who entertains them
with the latest Treddleston gossip. It is certainly rather an
unfortunate day that Alick, the shepherd, has chosen for having
the whittaws, since the morning turned out so wet; and Mrs.



<p/>97

<p/>Poyser has spoken her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) mind pretty strongly as to the dirt which
the extra number of men's shoes brought into the house at
dinnertime. Indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) has not yet recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) equanimity on
the subject, though it is now nearly three hours since dinner, and
the house-floor is perfectly clean again; as clean as everything else
in that wonderful house-place, where the only chance of collecting
a few grains of dust would be to climb on the salt-coffer, and put
your finger on the high mantel-shelf on which the glittering brass
candlesticks are enjoying their summer sinecure; for at this time
of year, of course, every one goes to bed while it is yet light, or at
least light enough to discern the outline of objects after you have
bruised your shins against them. Surely nowhere else could an
oak clock-case and an oak table have got to such a polish by the
hand: genuine <div class="bookquote">``elbow polish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>as Mrs. Poyser called it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
thanked God she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) never had any of your varnished rubbish in her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
house. Hetty Sorrel often took the opportunity, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>) aunt's
back was turned, of looking at the pleasing reflection of herself in
those polished surfaces, for the oak table was usually turned up
like a screen, and was more for ornament than for use; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>)
could see herself sometimes in the great round pewter dishes that
were ranged on the shelves above the long deal dinner-table, or in
the hobs of the grate, which always shone like jasper.
Everything was looking at its brightest at this moment, for the
sun shone right on the pewter dishes, and from their reflecting
surfaces pleasant jets of light were thrown on mellow oak and
bright brass--and on a still pleasanter object than these, for some
of the rays fell on Dinah's finely moulded cheek, and lit up her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
pale red hair to auburn, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) bent over the heavy household
linen which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was mending for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) aunt. No scene could have



<p/>98

<p/>been more peaceful, if Mrs. Poyser, who was ironing a few things
that still remained from the Monday's wash, had not been making
a frequent clinking with her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) iron and moving to and fro whenever
she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) wanted it to cool; carrying the keen glance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) blue-grey eye
from the kitchen to the dairy, where Hetty was making up the
butter, and from the dairy to the back kitchen, where Nancy was
taking the pies out of the oven. Do not suppose, however, that Mrs.
Poyser was elderly or shrewish in her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) appearance; she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was a goodlooking woman, not more than eight-and-thirty, of fair complexion
and sandy hair, well-shapen, light-footed. The most conspicuous
article in her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) attire was an ample checkered linen apron, which
almost covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) skirt; and nothing could be plainer or less
noticeable than her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) cap and gown, for there was no weakness of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was less tolerant than feminine vanity, and the
preference of ornament to utility. The family likeness between her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) niece Dinah Morris, with the contrast between her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
keenness and Dinah's seraphic gentleness of expression, might
have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for a Martha and
Mary. Their eyes were just of the same colour, but a striking test of
the difference in their operation was seen in the demeanour of
Trip, the black-and-tan terrier, whenever that much-suspected
dog unwarily exposed himself to the freezing arctic ray of Mrs.
Poyser's glance. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) tongue was not less keen than her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) eye, and,
whenever a damsel came within earshot, seemed to take up an
unfinished lecture, as a barrel-organ takes up a tune, precisely at
the point where it had left off.
The fact that it was churning day was another reason why it
was inconvenient to have the whittaws, and why, consequently,
Mrs. Poyser should scold Molly the housemaid with unusual



<p/>99

<p/>severity. To all appearance Molly had got through her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) after-dinner
work in an exemplary manner, had <div class="bookquote">``cleaned herself''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly</b></font>)</div>with great
dispatch, and now came to ask, submissively, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) should sit
down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) spinning till milking time. But this blameless conduct,
according to Mrs. Poyser, shrouded a secret indulgence of
unbecoming wishes, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) now dragged forth and held up to
Molly's view with cutting eloquence.
``Spinning, indeed! It isn't spinning as you'd be at, I'll be bound,
and let you have your own way. I never knew your equals for
gallowsness. To think of a gell o' your age wanting to go and sit
with half-a-dozen men! I'd ha' been ashamed to let the words pass
over my lips if I'd been you. And you, as have been here ever since
last Michaelmas, and I hired you at Treddles'on stattits, without a
bit o' character--as I say, you might be grateful to be hired in that
way to a respectable place; and you knew no more o' what belongs
to work when you come here than the mawkin i' the field. As poor
a two-fisted thing as ever I saw, you know you was. Who taught
you to scrub a floor, I should like to know? Why, you'd leave the
dirt in heaps i' the corners--anybody 'ud think you'd never been
brought up among Christians. And as for spinning, why, you've
wasted as much as your wage i' the flax you've spoiled learning to
spin. And you've a right to feel that, and not to go about as gaping
and as thoughtless as if you was beholding to nobody. Comb the
wool for the whittaws, indeed! That's what you'd like to be doing,
is it? That's the way with you--that's the road you'd all like to go,
headlongs to ruin. You're never easy till you've got some
sweetheart as is as big a fool as yourself: you think you'll be finely
off when you're married, I daresay, and have got a three-legged



<p/>100

<p/>cake for your dinner, as three children are a-snatching at.''
``I'm sure I donna want t' go wi' the whittaws,'' said Molly,
whimpering, and quite overcome by this Dantean picture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
future, ``on'y we allays used to comb the wool for ’n at Mester
Ottley's; an' so I just axed ye. I donna want to set eyes on the
whittaws again; I wish I may never stir if I do.''
``Mr. Ottley's, indeed! It's fine talking o' what you did at Mr.
Ottley's. Your missis there might like her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) floors dirted wi'
whittaws for what I know. There's no knowing what people wonna
like--such ways as I've heard of! I never had a gell come into my
house as seemed to know what cleaning was; I think people live
like pigs, for my part. And as to that Betty as was dairymaid at
Trent's before she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) come to me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>)'d ha' left the cheeses without
turning from week's end to week's end, and the dairy thralls, I
might ha' wrote my name on ’em, when I come downstairs after
my illness, as the doctor said it was inflammation--it was a mercy
I got well of it. And to think o' your knowing no better, Molly, and
been here a-going i' nine months, and not for want o' talking to,
neither--and what are you stanning there for, like a jack as is run
down, instead o' getting your wheel out? You're a rare un for
sitting down to your work a little while after it's time to put by.''
``Munny, my iron's twite told; pease put it down to warm.''
The small chirruping voice that uttered this request came from
a little sunny-haired girl between three and four, who, seated on a
high chair at the end of the ironing table, was arduously clutching
the handle of a miniature iron with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tiny fat fist, and ironing
rags with an assiduity that required her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to put her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) little red tongue
out as far as anatomy would allow.
<div class="bookquote">``Cold, is it, my darling? Bless your sweet face!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.



<p/>101

<p/>Poyser, who was remarkable for the facility with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) could
relapse from her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) official objurgatory to one of fondness or of
friendly converse. <div class="bookquote">``Never mind! Mother's done her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) ironing now.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s going to put the ironing things away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Munny, I tould 'ike to do into de barn to Tommy, to see de

make the butter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I tould 'ike a bit o' pum-take,''  (<font color='red'><b>Totty</b></font>)</div>rejoined Totty, who seemed to
be provided with several relays of requests; at the same time,
taking the opportunity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) momentary leisure to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) fingers
into a bowl of starch, and drag it down so as to empty the contents
with tolerable completeness on to the ironing sheet.
<div class="bookquote">``Did ever anybody see the like?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>screamed Mrs. Poyser,
running towards the table when her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) eye had fallen on the blue
stream. <div class="bookquote">``The child's allays i' mischief if your back's turned a
minute. What shall I do to you, you naughty, naughty gell?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Totty</b></font>)</div>Totty, however, had descended from her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) chair with great
swiftness, and was already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort
of waddling run, and an amount of fat on the nape of her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) neck
which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) look like the metamorphosis of a white suckling
pig.
The starch having been wiped up by Molly's help, and the
ironing apparatus put by, Mrs. Poyser took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) knitting which
always lay ready at hand, and was the work she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) liked best, because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) could carry it on automatically as she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) walked to and fro. But
now she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) came and sat down opposite Dinah, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) looked at
in a meditative way, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) knitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) grey worsted stocking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look th' image o' your Aunt Judith, Dinah, when you sit asewing. I could almost fancy it was thirty years back, and I was a
little gell at home, looking at Judith as she (<font color='blue'><b>Judith</b></font>) sat at her (<font color='blue'><b>Judith</b></font>) work, after
she (<font color='blue'><b>Judith</b></font>)'d done the house up; only it was a little cottage, Father's was,
and not a big rambling house as gets dirty i' one corner as fast as
you clean it in another--but for all that, I could fancy you was your
Aunt Judith, only her (<font color='blue'><b>Judith</b></font>) hair was a deal darker than yours, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Judith</b></font>)
was stouter and broader i' the shoulders. Judith and me allays
hung together, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Judith</b></font>) had such queer ways, but your mother
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Judith</b></font>) never could agree. Ah, your mother little thought as she (<font color='blue'><b>Judith</b></font>)'d
have a daughter just cut out after the very pattern o' Judith, and
leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Judith</b></font>) an orphan, too, for Judith to take care on, and bring up
with a spoon when she (<font color='blue'><b>Judith</b></font>) was in the graveyard at Stoniton. I allays
said that o' Judith, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Judith</b></font>)'d bear a pound weight any day to save
anybody else carrying a ounce. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Judith</b></font>) was just the same from
the first o' my remembering her (<font color='blue'><b>Judith</b></font>); it made no difference in her (<font color='blue'><b>Judith</b></font>), as I
could see, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Judith</b></font>) took to the Methodists, only she (<font color='blue'><b>Judith</b></font>) talked a bit
different and wore a different sort o' cap; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Judith</b></font>)'d never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Judith</b></font>)
life spent a penny on herself more than keeping herself decent.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Judith</b></font>) was a blessed woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>said Dinah; <div class="bookquote">``God had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Judith</b></font>) a
loving, self-forgetting nature, and He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) perfected it by grace. And
she (<font color='blue'><b>Judith</b></font>) was very fond of you too, Aunt Rachel. I often heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) talk of
you in the same sort of way. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) had that bad illness, and I
was only eleven years old, she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) used to say, `You'll have a friend on
earth in your Aunt Rachel, if I'm taken from you, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) has a
kind heart,' and I'm sure I've found it so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>``I don't know how, child; anybody 'ud be cunning to do
anything for you, I think; you're like the birds o' th' air, and live
nobody knows how. I'd ha' been glad to behave to you like a



<p/>103

<p/>mother's sister, if you'd come and live i' this country where there's
some shelter and victual for man and beast, and folks don't live on
the naked hills, like poultry a-scratching on a gravel bank. And
then you might get married to some decent man, and there'd be
plenty ready to have you, if you'd only leave off that preaching, as
is ten times worse than anything your Aunt Judith ever did. And
even if you'd marry Seth Bede, as is a poor wool-gathering
Methodist and 's never like to have a penny beforehand, I know
your uncle 'ud help you with a pig, and very like a cow, for he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)'s
allays been good-natur'd to my kin, for all they're poor, and made
’em welcome to the house; and 'ud do for you, I'll be bound, as
much as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)'d do for Hetty, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) own niece. And
there's linen in the house as I could well spare you, for I've got lots
o' sheeting and table-clothing, and towelling, as isn't made up.
There's a piece o' sheeting I could give you as that squinting Kitty
spun--she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was a rare girl to spin, for all she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) squinted, and the
children couldn't abide her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>); and, you know, the spinning's going
on constant, and there's new linen wove twice as fast as the old
wears out. But where's the use o' talking, if ye wonna be
persuaded, and settle down like any other woman in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) senses,
i'stead o' wearing yourself out with walking and preaching, and
giving away every penny you get, so as you've nothing saved
against sickness; and all the things you've got i' the world, I verily
believe, 'ud go into a bundle no bigger nor a double cheese. And
all because you've got notions i' your head about religion more nor
what's i' the Catechism and the Prayer-book.''
``But not more than what's in the Bible, Aunt,'' said Dinah.
``Yes, and the Bible too, for that matter,'' Mrs. Poyser rejoined,
rather sharply; ``else why shouldn't them as know best what's in



<p/>104

<p/>the Bible--the parsons and people as have got nothing to do but
learn it--do the same as you do? But, for the matter o' that, if
everybody was to do like you, the world must come to a standstill;
for if everybody tried to do without house and home, and with
poor eating and drinking, and was allays talking as we must
despise the things o' the world as you say, I should like to know
where the pick o' the stock, and the corn, and the best new-milk
cheeeses 'ud have to go. Everybody 'ud be wanting bread made o'
tail ends and everybody 'ud be running after everybody else to
preach to ’em, istead o' bringing up their families, and laying by
against a bad harvest. It stands to sense as that can't be the right
religion.''
``Nay, dear aunt, you never heard me say that all people are
called to forsake their work and their families. It's quite right the
land should be ploughed and sowed, and the precious corn stored,
and the things of this life cared for, and right that people should
rejoice in their families, and provide for them, so that this is done
in the fear of the Lord, and that they are not unmindful of the
soul's wants while they are caring for the body. We can all be
servants of God wherever our lot is cast, but He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) gives us different
sorts of work, according as He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fits us for it and calls us to it. I can
no more help spending my life in trying to do what I can for the
souls of others, than you could help running if you heard little
Totty crying at the other end of the house; the voice would go to
your heart, you would think the dear child was in trouble or in
danger, and you couldn't rest without running to help her (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) and
comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>).''
``Ah,'' said Mrs. Poyser, rising and walking towards the door, ``I
know it 'ud be just the same if I was to talk to you for hours. You'd



<p/>105

<p/>make me the same answer, at th' end. I might as well talk to the
running brook and tell it to stan' still.''
The causeway outside the kitchen door was dry enough now for
Mrs. Poyser to stand there quite pleasantly and see what was
going on in the yard, the grey worsted stocking making a steady
progress in her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) hands all the while. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) had not been standing
there more than five minutes before she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) came in again, and said to
Dinah, in rather a flurried, awe-stricken tone, ``If there isn't
Captain Donnithorne and Mr. Irwine a-coming into the yard! I'll
lay my life they're come to speak about your preaching on the
Green, Dinah; it's you must answer ’em, for I'm dumb. I've said
enough a'ready about your bringing such disgrace upo' your
uncle's family. I wouldn't ha' minded if you'd been Mr. Poyser's
own niece--folks must put up wi' their own kin, as they put up wi'
their own noses--it's their own flesh and blood. But to think of a
niece o' mine being cause o' my husband's being turned out of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
farm, and me brought him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) no fortin but my savin's--''
``Nay, dear Aunt Rachel,'' said Dinah gently, ``you've no cause
for such fears. I've strong assurance that no evil will happen to you
and my uncle and the children from anything I've done. I didn't
preach without direction.''
``Direction! I know very well what you mean by direction,'' said
Mrs. Poyser, knitting in a rapid and agitated manner. <div class="bookquote">``When
there's a bigger maggot than usial in your head you call it
`direction'; and then nothing can stir you--you look like the statty
o' the outside o' Treddles'on church, a-starin' and a-smilin'
whether it's fair weather or foul. I hanna common patience with
you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>By this time the two gentlemen had reached the palings and



<p/>106

<p/>had got down from their horses: it was plain they meant to come
in. Mrs. Poyser advanced to the door to meet them, curtsying low
and trembling between anger with Dinah and anxiety to conduct
herself with perfect propriety on the occasion. For in those days
the keenest of bucolic minds felt a whispering awe at the sight of
the gentry, such as of old men felt when they stood on tiptoe to
watch the gods passing by in tall human shape.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, Mrs. Poyser, how are you after this stormy morning?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Irwine, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) stately cordiality. <div class="bookquote">``Our feet are quite dry;
we shall not soil your beautiful floor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir, don't mention it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser. <div class="bookquote">``Will you and the
captain please to walk into the parlour?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, thank you, Mrs. Poyser,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>said the captain, looking
eagerly round the kitchen, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) eye were seeking something it
could not find. <div class="bookquote">``I delight in your kitchen. I think it is the most
charming room I know. I should like every farmer's wife to come
and look at it for a pattern.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you're pleased to say so, sir. Pray take a seat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Poyser, relieved a little by this compliment and the captain's
evident good-humour, but still glancing anxiously at Mr. Irwine,
who, she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) saw, was looking at Dinah and advancing towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Poyser is not at home, is he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain Donnithorne,
seating himself where he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) could see along the short passage to the
open dairy-door.
<div class="bookquote">``No, sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) isn't; he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)'s gone to Rosseter to see Mr. West, the
factor, about the wool. But there's Father i' the barn, sir, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'d be
of any use.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``No, thank you; I'll just look at the whelps and leave a message
about them with your shepherd. I must come another day and see



<p/>107

<p/>your husband; I want to have a consultation with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) about
horses. Do you know when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s likely to be at liberty?''
``Why, sir, you can hardly miss him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), except it's o' Treddles'on
market-day--that's of a Friday, you know. For if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s anywhere on
the farm we can send for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in a minute. If we'd got rid o' the
Scantlands, we should have no outlying fields; and I should be
glad of it, for if ever anything happens, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s sure to be gone to the
Scantlands. Things allays happen so contrairy, if they've a chance;
and it's an unnat'ral thing to have one bit o' your farm in one
county and all the rest in another.''
``Ah, the Scantlands would go much better with Choyce's farm,
especially as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wants dairy-land and you've got plenty. I think
yours is the prettiest farm on the estate, though; and do you know,
Mrs. Poyser, if I were going to marry and settle, I should be
tempted to turn you out, and do up this fine old house, and turn
farmer myself.''
``Oh, sir,'' said Mrs. Poyser, rather alarmed, ``you wouldn't like
it at all. As for farming, it's putting money into your pocket wi'
your right hand and fetching it out wi' your left. As fur as I can see,
it's raising victual for other folks and just getting a mouthful for
yourself and your children as you go along. Not as you'd be like a
poor man as wants to get his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bread--you could afford to lose as
much money as you liked i' farming--but it's poor fun losing
money, I should think, though I understan' it's what the great folks
i' London play at more than anything. For my husband heard at
market as Lord Dacey's eldest son had lost thousands upo'
thousands to the Prince o' Wales, and they said my lady was going
to pawn her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) jewels to pay for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). But you know more about that
than I do, sir. But, as for farming, sir, I canna think as you'd like it;



<p/>108

<p/>and this house--the draughts in it are enough to cut you through,
and it's my opinion the floors upstairs are very rotten, and the rats
i' the cellar are beyond anything.''
``Why, that's a terrible picture, Mrs. Poyser. I think I should be
doing you a service to turn you out of such a place. But there's no
chance of that. I'm not likely to settle for the next twenty years, till
I'm a stout gentleman of forty; and my grandfather would never
consent to part with such good tenants as you.''
``Well, sir, if he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) thinks so well o' Mr. Poyser for a tenant I wish
you could put in a word for him (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) to allow us some new gates for the
Five closes, for my husband's been asking and asking till he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s
tired, and to think o' what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s done for the farm, and 's never had
a penny allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), be the times bad or good. And as I've said to
my husband often and often, I'm sure if the captain had anything
to do with it, it wouldn't be so. Not as I wish to speak disrespectful
o' them as have got the power i' their hands, but it's more than
flesh and blood 'ull bear sometimes, to be toiling and striving, and
up early and down late, and hardly sleeping a wink when you lie
down for thinking as the cheese may swell, or the cows may slip
their calf, or the wheat may grow green again i' the sheaf--and
after all, at th' end o' the year, it's like as if you'd been cooking a
feast and had got the smell of it for your pains.''
Mrs. Poyser, once launched into conversation, always sailed
along without any check from her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) preliminary awe of the gentry.
The confidence she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) felt in her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) own powers of exposition was a
motive force that overcame all resistance.
``I'm afraid I should only do harm instead of good, if I were to
speak about the gates, Mrs. Poyser,'' said the captain, ``though I
assure you there's no man on the estate I would sooner say a word



<p/>109

<p/>for than your husband. I know his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) farm is in better order than any
other within ten miles of us; and as for the kitchen,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) added,
smiling, ``I don't believe there's one in the kingdom to beat it. By
the by, I've never seen your dairy: I must see your dairy, Mrs.
Poyser.''
``Indeed, sir, it's not fit for you to go in, for Hetty's in the middle
o' making the butter, for the churning was thrown late, and I'm
quite ashamed.'' This Mrs. Poyser said blushing, and believing
that the captain was really interested in her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) milk-pans, and would
adjust his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) to the appearance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) dairy. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I've
no doubt it's in capital order. Take me in,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the captain,
himself leading the way, while Mrs. Poyser followed.




<p/>110

<p/>Chapter VII
The Dairy

<p/>T

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) dairy was certainly worth looking at: it was a scene to
sicken for with a sort of calenture in hot and dusty
streets--such coolness, such purity, such fresh fragrance
of new-pressed cheese, of firm butter, of wooden vessels
perpetually bathed in pure water; such soft colouring of red
earthenware and creamy surfaces, brown wood and polished tin,
grey limestone and rich orange-red rust on the iron weights and
hooks and hinges. But one gets only a confused notion of these
details when they surround a distractingly pretty girl of seventeen,
standing on little pattens and rounding her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dimpled arm to lift a
pound of butter out of the scale.
Hetty blushed a deep rose-colour when Captain Donnithorne
entered the dairy and spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>); but it was not at all a
distressed blush, for it was inwreathed with smiles and dimples,
and with sparkles from under long, curled, dark eyelashes; and
while her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt was discoursing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) about the limited amount of
milk that was to be spared for butter and cheese so long as the
calves were not all weaned, and a large quantity but inferior
quality of milk yielded by the shorthorn, which had been bought
on experiment, together with other matters which must be
interesting to a young gentleman who would one day be a
landlord, Hetty tossed and patted her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) pound of butter with quite a
self-possessed, coquettish air, slyly conscious that no turn of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
head was lost.




<p/>111

<p/>There are various orders of beauty, causing men to make fools
of themselves in various styles, from the desperate to the sheepish;
but there is one order of beauty which seems made to turn the
heads not only of men, but of all intelligent mammals, even of
women. It is a beauty like that of kittens, or very small downy
ducks making gentle rippling noises with their soft bills, or babies
just beginning to toddle and to engage in conscious mischief--a
beauty with which you can never be angry, but that you feel ready
to crush for inability to comprehend the state of mind into which it
throws you. Hetty Sorrel's was that sort of beauty. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>) aunt, Mrs.
Poyser, who professed to despise all personal attractions and
intended to be the severest of mentors, continually gazed at
Hetty's charms by the sly, fascinated in spite of herself; and after
administering such a scolding as naturally flowed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) anxiety
to do well by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) husband's niece--who had no mother of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) own
to scold her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), poor thing!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would often confess to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) husband,
when they were safe out of hearing, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) firmly believed, <div class="bookquote">``the
naughtier the little huzzy behaved, the prettier she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) looked.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It is of little use for me to tell you that Hetty's cheek was like a
rose-petal, that dimples played about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) pouting lips, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
large dark eyes hid a soft roguishness under their long lashes, and
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) curly hair, though all pushed back under her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) round cap
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was at work, stole back in dark delicate rings on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
forehead, and about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) white shell-like ears; it is of little use for
me to say how lovely was the contour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) pink-and-white
neckerchief, tucked into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) low plum-coloured stuff bodice, or
how the linen butter-making apron, with its bib, seemed a thing to
be imitated in silk by duchesses, since it fell in such charming
lines, or how her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) brown stockings and thick-soled buckled shoes



<p/>112

<p/>lost all that clumsiness which they must certainly have had when
empty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) foot and ankle--of little use, unless you have seen a
woman who affected you as Hetty affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) beholders, for
otherwise, though you might conjure up the image of a lovely
woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would not in the least resemble that distracting
kitten-like maiden. I might mention all the divine charms of a
bright spring day, but if you had never in your life utterly
forgotten yourself in straining your eyes after the mounting lark,
or in wandering through the still lanes when the fresh-opened
blossoms fill them with a sacred silent beauty like that of fretted
aisles, where would be the use of my descriptive catalogue? I
could never make you know what I meant by a bright spring day.
Hetty's was a spring-tide beauty; it was the beauty of young
frisking things, round-limbed, gambolling, circumventing you by a
false air of innocence--the innocence of a young star-browed calf,
for example, that, being inclined for a promenade out of bounds,
leads you a severe steeplechase over hedge and ditch, and only
comes to a stand in the middle of a bog.
And they are the prettiest attitudes and movements into which
a pretty girl is thrown in making up butter--tossing movements
that give a charming curve to the arm, and a sideward inclination
of the round white neck; little patting and rolling movements with
the palm of the hand, and nice adaptations and finishings which
cannot at all be effected without a great play of the pouting mouth
and the dark eyes. And then the butter itself seems to
communicate a fresh charm--it is so pure, so sweet-scented; it is
turned off the mould with such a beautiful firm surface, like
marble in a pale yellow light! Moreover, Hetty was particularly
clever at making up the butter; it was the one performance of hers



<p/>113

<p/>that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt allowed to pass without severe criticism; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
handled it with all the grace that belongs to mastery.
<div class="bookquote">``I hope you will be ready for a great holiday on the thirtieth of
July, Mrs. Poyser,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain Donnithorne, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) had
sufficiently admired the dairy and given several improvised
opinions on Swede turnips and shorthorns. <div class="bookquote">``You know what is to
happen then, and I shall expect you to be one of the guests who
come earliest and leave latest. Will you promise me your hand for
two dances, Miss Hetty? If I don't get your promise now, I know I
shall hardly have a chance, for all the smart young farmers will
take care to secure you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>Hetty smiled and blushed, but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could answer, Mrs.
Poyser interposed, scandalised at the mere suggestion that the
young squire could be excluded by any meaner partners.
<div class="bookquote">``Indeed, sir, you are very kind to take that notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). And
I'm sure, whenever you're pleased to dance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'ll be
proud and thankful, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) stood still all the rest o' th' evening.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, no, that would be too cruel to all the other young
fellows who can dance. But you will promise me two dances, won't
you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>the captain continued, determined to make Hetty look at
him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) and speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>).
Hetty dropped the prettiest little curtsy, and stole a half-shy,
half-coquettish glance at him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, thank you, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And you must bring all your children, you know, Mrs. Poyser;
your little Totty, as well as the boys. I want all the youngest
children on the estate to be there--all those who will be fine young
men and women when I'm a bald old fellow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, sir, that 'ull be a long time first,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser,
quite overcome at the young squire's speaking so lightly of



<p/>114

<p/>himself, and thinking how her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) husband would be interested in
hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) recount this remarkable specimen of high-born
humour. The captain was thought to be <div class="bookquote">``very full of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) jokes,''
 (<font color='red'><b>The captain</b></font>)</div>and was a great favourite throughout the estate on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)
free manners. Every tenant was quite sure things would be
different when the reins got into his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) hands--there was to be a
millennial abundance of new gates, allowances of lime, and
returns of ten per cent.
<div class="bookquote">``But where is Totty to-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I want to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where is the little un, Hetty?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) came in
here not long ago.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) went into the brewhouse to Nancy, I think.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The mother</b></font>)</div>The proud mother, unable to resist the temptation to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
Totty, passed at once into the back kitchen, in search of her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>), not,
however, without misgivings lest something should have
happened to render her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) person and attire unfit for presentation.
<div class="bookquote">``And do you carry the butter to market when you've made it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain to Hetty, meanwhile.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh no, sir; not when it's so heavy. I'm not strong enough to
carry it. Alick takes it on horseback.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm sure your pretty arms were never meant for such
heavy weights. But you go out a walk sometimes these pleasant
evenings, don't you? Why don't you have a walk in the Chase
sometimes, now it's so green and pleasant? I hardly ever see you
anywhere except at home and at church.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aunt doesn't like me to go a-walking only when I'm going
somewhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>said Hetty. <div class="bookquote">``But I go through the Chase sometimes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And don't you ever go to see Mrs. Best, the housekeeper? I
think I saw you once in the housekeeper's room.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>115

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't Mrs. Best, it's Mrs. Pomfret, the lady's maid, as I go to
see. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>)'s teaching me tent-stitch and the lace-mending. I'm going
to tea with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>) to-morrow afternoon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Totty</b></font>)</div>The reason why there had been space for this tête-à-tête can
only be known by looking into the back kitchen, where Totty had
been discovered rubbing a stray blue-bag against her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) nose, and in
the same moment allowing some liberal indigo drops to fall on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
afternoon pinafore. But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) appeared holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mother's
hand--the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) round nose rather shiny from a recent and
hurried application of soap and water.
<div class="bookquote">``Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>said the captain, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) up and setting her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) on
the low stone shelf. <div class="bookquote">``Here's Totty! By the by, what's her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>) other
name? She (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>) wasn't christened Totty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir, we call her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>) sadly out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>) name. Charlotte's her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>)
christened name. It's a name i' Mr. Poyser's family: his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
grandmother was named Charlotte. But we began with calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
Lotty, and now it's got to Totty. To be sure it's more like a name
for a dog than a Christian child.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Totty's a capital name. Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) looks like a Totty. Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) got
a pocket on?''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>said the captain, feeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) own waistcoat
pockets.
Totty immediately with great gravity lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) frock, and
showed a tiny pink pocket at present in a state of collapse.
<div class="bookquote">``It dot notin' in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) looked down at it very
earnestly.
<div class="bookquote">``No! What a pity! Such a pretty pocket. Well, I think I've got
some things in mine that will make a pretty jingle in it. Yes! I
declare I've got five little round silver things, and hear what a
pretty noise they make in Totty's pink pocket.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) shook the



<p/>116

<p/>pocket with the five sixpences in it, and Totty showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) teeth
and wrinkled her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) nose in great glee; but, divining that there was
nothing more to be got by staying, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) jumped off the shelf and
ran away to jingle her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) pocket in the hearing of Nancy, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
mother called after her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Oh for shame, you naughty gell! Not to
thank the captain for what he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'s given you I'm sure, sir, it's very
kind of you; but she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s spoiled shameful; her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) father won't have her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
said nay in anything, and there's no managing her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). It's being the

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s a funny little fatty; I wouldn't have her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) different. But
I must be going now, for I suppose the rector is waiting for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>With a <div class="bookquote">``good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>a bright glance, and a bow to Hetty, Arthur
left the dairy. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was mistaken in imagining himself waited
for. The rector had been so much interested in his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) conversation
with Dinah that he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) would not have chosen to close it earlier; and
you shall hear now what they had been saying to each other.

<p/>Chapter VIII
A Vocation

<p/>D

<p/>inah, who had risen when the gentlemen came in, but still
kept hold of the sheet she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was mending, curtsied
respectfully when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) saw Mr. Irwine looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) and
advancing towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) had never yet spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), or stood
face to face with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) first thought, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) eyes met his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>),
was, <div class="bookquote">``What a well-favoured countenance! Oh that the good seed
might fall on that soil, for it would surely flourish.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>The agreeable
impression must have been mutual, for Mr. Irwine bowed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
with a benignant deference, which would have been equally in
place if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had been the most dignified lady of his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) acquaintance.
<div class="bookquote">``You are only a visitor in this neighbourhood, I think?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>were
his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) first words, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) seated himself opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``No, sir, I come from Snowfield, in Stonyshire. But my aunt
was very kind, wanting me to have rest from my work there,
because I'd been ill, and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) invited me to come and stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
for a while.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I remember Snowfield very well; I once had occasion to go
there. It's a dreary bleak place. They were building a cotton-mill
there; but that's many years ago now. I suppose the place is a good
deal changed by the employment that mill must have brought.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``It is changed so far as the mill has brought people there, who
get a livelihood for themselves by working in it, and make it better
for the trades-folks. I work in it myself, and have reason to be
grateful, for thereby I have enough and to spare. But it's still a



<p/>118

<p/>bleak place, as you say, sir--very different from this country.''
``You have relations living there, probably, so that you are
attached to the place as your home?''
``I had an aunt there once; she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) brought me up, for I was an
orphan. But she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was taken away seven years ago, and I have no
other kindred that I know of, besides my Aunt Poyser, who is very
good to me, and would have me come and live in this country,
which to be sure is a good land, wherein they eat bread without
scarceness. But I'm not free to leave Snowfield, where I was first
planted, and have grown deep into it, like the small grass on the
hill-top.''
``Ah, I daresay you have many religious friends and companions
there; you are a Methodist--a Wesleyan, I think?''
``Yes, my aunt at Snowfield belonged to the Society, and I have
cause to be thankful for the privileges I have had thereby from my
earliest childhood.''
``And have you been long in the habit of preaching? For I
understand you preached at Hayslope last night.''
``I first took to the work four years since, when I was twentyone.''
``Your Society sanctions women's preaching, then?''
``It doesn't forbid them, sir, when they've a clear call to the
work, and when their ministry is owned by the conversion of
sinners and the strengthening of God's people. Mrs. Fletcher, as
you may have heard about, was the first woman to preach in the
Society, I believe, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Fletcher</b></font>) was married, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fletcher</b></font>) was Miss
Bosanquet; and Mr. Wesley approved of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bosanquet</b></font>) undertaking the
work. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bosanquet</b></font>) had a great gift, and there are many others now living
who are precious fellow-helpers in the work of the ministry. I



<p/>119

<p/>understand there's been voices raised against it in the Society of
late, but I cannot but think their counsel will come to nought. It
isn't for men to make channels for God's Spirit, as they make
channels for the watercourses, and say, `Flow here, but flow not
there.'''
<div class="bookquote">``But don't you find some danger among your people--I don't
mean to say that it is so with you, far from it--but don't you find
sometimes that both men and women fancy themselves channels
for God's Spirit, and are quite mistaken, so that they set about a
work for which they are unfit and bring holy things into
contempt?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Doubtless it is so sometimes; for there have been evil-doers
among us who have sought to deceive the brethren, and some
there are who deceive their own selves. But we are not without
discipline and correction to put a check upon these things. There's
a very strict order kept among us, and the brethren and sisters
watch for each other's souls as they that must give account. They
don't go every one his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) own way and say, `Am I my brother's
keeper?'''
``But tell me--if I may ask, and I am really interested in
knowing it--how you first came to think of preaching?''
``Indeed, sir, I didn't think of it at all--I'd been used from the
time I was sixteen to talk to the little children, and teach them, and
sometimes I had had my heart enlarged to speak in class, and was
much drawn out in prayer with the sick. But I had felt no call to
preach, for when I'm not greatly wrought upon, I'm too much
given to sit still and keep by myself. It seems as if I could sit silent
all day long with the thought of God overflowing my soul--as the
pebbles lie bathed in the Willow Brook. For thoughts are so



<p/>120

<p/>great--aren't they, sir? They seem to lie upon us like a deep flood;
and it's my besetment to forget where I am and everything about
me, and lose myself in thoughts that I could give no account of, for
I could neither make a beginning nor ending of them in words.
That was my way as long as I can remember; but sometimes it
seemed as if speech came to me without any will of my own, and
words were given to me that came out as the tears come, because
our hearts are full and we can't help it. And those were always
times of great blessing, though I had never thought it could be so
with me before a congregation of people. But, sir, we are led on,
like the little children, by a way that we know not. I was called to
preach quite suddenly, and since then I have never been left in
doubt about the work that was laid upon me.''
``But tell me the circumstances--just how it was, the very day
you began to preach.''
``It was one Sunday I walked with brother Marlowe, who was an
aged man, one of the local preachers, all the way to HettonDeeps--that's a village where the people get their living by
working in the lead-mines, and where there's no church nor
preacher, but they live like sheep without a shepherd. It's better
than twelve miles from Snowfield, so we set out early in the
morning, for it was summertime; and I had a wonderful sense of
the Divine love as we walked over the hills, where there's no trees,
you know, sir, as there is here, to make the sky look smaller, but
you see the heavens stretched out like a tent, and you feel the
everlasting arms around you. But before we got to Hetton, brother
Marlowe was seized with a dizziness that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>) afraid of
falling, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>) overworked himself sadly, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>) years, in watching
and praying, and walking so many miles to speak the Word, as



<p/>121

<p/>well as carrying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>) trade of linen-weaving. And when we got to
the village, the people were expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>)'d appointed the
time and the place when he (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>) was there before, and such of them as
cared to hear the Word of Life were assembled on a spot where
the cottages was thickest, so as others might be drawn to come.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>) felt as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>) couldn't stand up to preach, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>) was forced to
lie down in the first of the cottages we came to. So I went to tell
the people, thinking we'd go into one of the houses, and I would
read and pray with them. But as I passed along by the cottages
and saw the aged and trembling women at the doors, and the hard
looks of the men, who seemed to have their eyes no more filled
with the sight of the Sabbath morning than if they had been dumb
oxen that never looked up to the sky, I felt a great movement in
my soul, and I trembled as if I was shaken by a strong spirit
entering into my weak body. And I went to where the little flock of
people was gathered together, and stepped on the low wall that
was built against the green hillside, and I spoke the words that
were given to me abundantly. And they all came round me out of
all the cottages, and many wept over their sins, and have since
been joined to the Lord. That was the beginning of my preaching,
sir, and I've preached ever since.''
Dinah had let her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) work fall during this narrative, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
uttered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) usual simple way, but with that sincere articulate,
thrilling treble by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) always mastered her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) audience. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
stooped now to gather up her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) sewing, and then went on with it as
before. Mr. Irwine was deeply interested. He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
must be a miserable prig who would act the pedagogue here: one
might as well go and lecture the trees for growing in their own
shape.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>122

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you never feel any embarrassment from the sense of your
youth--that you are a lovely young woman on whom men's eyes
are fixed?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) said aloud.
<div class="bookquote">``No, I've no room for such feelings, and I don't believe the
people ever take notice about that. I think, sir, when God makes
His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) presence felt through us, we are like the burning bush: Moses
never took any heed what sort of bush it was--he (<font color='blue'><b>bush</b></font>) only saw the
brightness of the Lord. I've preached to as rough ignorant people
as can be in the villages about Snowfield--men that looked very
hard and wild--but they never said an uncivil word to me, and
often thanked me kindly as they made way for me to pass through
the midst of them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That I can believe--that I can well believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Irwine,
emphatically. <div class="bookquote">``And what did you think of your hearers last night,
now? Did you find them quiet and attentive?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Very quiet, sir, but I saw no signs of any great work upon
them, except in a young girl named Bessy Cranage, towards whom
my heart yearned greatly, when my eyes first fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) blooming
youth, given up to folly and vanity. I had some private talk and
prayer with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) afterwards, and I trust her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart is touched. But
I've noticed that in these villages where the people lead a quiet life
among the green pastures and the still waters, tilling the ground
and tending the cattle, there's a strange deadness to the Word, as
different as can be from the great towns, like Leeds, where I once
went to visit a holy woman who preaches there. It's wonderful how
rich is the harvest of souls up those high-walled streets, where you
seemed to walk as in a prison-yard, and the ear is deafened with
the sounds of worldly toil. I think maybe it is because the promise
is sweeter when this life is so dark and weary, and the soul gets



<p/>123

<p/>more hungry when the body is ill at ease.''
``Why, yes, our farm-labourers are not easily roused. They take
life almost as slowly as the sheep and cows. But we have some
intelligent workmen about here. I daresay you know the Bedes;
Seth Bede, by the by, is a Methodist.''
``Yes, I know Seth well, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) brother Adam a little. Seth is a
gracious young man--sincere and without offence; and Adam is
like the patriarch Joseph, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) great skill and knowledge and the
kindness he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) shows to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) brother and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) parents.''
``Perhaps you don't know the trouble that has just happened to
them? Their father, Matthias Bede, was drowned in the Willow
Brook last night, not far from his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthias</b></font>) own door. I'm going now to see
Adam.''
``Ah, their poor aged mother!'' said Dinah, dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hands
and looking before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) with pitying eyes, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) saw the object of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) sympathy. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will mourn heavily, for Seth has told me she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s
of an anxious, troubled heart. I must go and see if I can give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
any help.''
As she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) rose and was beginning to fold up her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) work, Captain
Donnithorne, having exhausted all plausible pretexts for
remaining among the milk-pans, came out of the dairy, followed
by Mrs. Poyser. Mr. Irwine now rose also, and, advancing towards
Dinah, held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) hand, and said, ``Good-bye. I hear you are
going away soon; but this will not be the last visit you will pay your
aunt--so we shall meet again, I hope.''
His (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) cordiality towards Dinah set all Mrs. Poyser's anxieties at
rest, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) face was brighter than usual, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I've never
asked after Mrs. Irwine and the Miss Irwines, sir; I hope they're as
well as usual.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>124

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, thank you, Mrs. Poyser, except that Miss Anne has one of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) bad headaches to-day. By the by, we all liked that nice creamcheese you sent us--my mother especially.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm very glad, indeed, sir. It is but seldom I make one, but I
remembered Mrs. Irwine was fond of ’em. Please to give my duty
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>), and to Miss Kate and Miss Anne. They've never been to
look at my poultry this long while, and I've got some beautiful
speckled chickens, black and white, as Miss Kate might like to
have some of amongst hers.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) must come and see them. Good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>the rector</b></font>)</div>said
the rector, mounting his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) horse.
<div class="bookquote">``Just ride slowly on, Irwine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain Donnithorne,
mounting also. <div class="bookquote">``I'll overtake you in three minutes. I'm only going
to speak to the shepherd about the whelps. Good-bye, Mrs. Poyser;
tell your husband I shall come and have a long talk with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
soon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Poyser curtsied duly, and watched the two horses until
they had disappeared from the yard, amidst great excitement on
the part of the pigs and the poultry, and under the furious
indignation of the bull-dog, who performed a Pyrrhic dance, that
every moment seemed to threaten the breaking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) chain. Mrs.
Poyser delighted in this noisy exit; it was a fresh assurance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
that the farm-yard was well guarded, and that no loiterers could
enter unobserved; and it was not until the gate had closed behind
the captain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) turned into the kitchen again, where Dinah
stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) bonnet in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hand, waiting to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) aunt,
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) set out for Lisbeth Bede's cottage.
Mrs. Poyser, however, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) noticed the bonnet, deferred
remarking on it until she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) had disburdened herself of her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) surprise



<p/>125

<p/>at Mr. Irwine's behaviour.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, Mr. Irwine wasn't angry, then? What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) say to you,
Dinah? Didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) scold you for preaching?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) was not at all angry; he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) was very friendly to me. I was
quite drawn out to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>); I hardly know how, for I had
always thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) as a worldly Sadducee. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) countenance
is as pleasant as the morning sunshine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pleasant! And what else did y' expect to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) but
pleasant?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser impatiently, resuming her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) knitting. <div class="bookquote">``I
should think his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) countenance is pleasant indeed! And him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) a
gentleman born, and 's got a mother like a picter. You may go the
country round and not find such another woman turned sixty-six.
It's summat-like to see such a man as that i' the desk of a Sunday!
As I say to Poyser, it's like looking at a full crop o' wheat, or a
pasture with a fine dairy o' cows in it; it makes you think the
world's comfortable-like. But as for such creaturs as you
Methodisses run after, I'd as soon go to look at a lot o' bare-ribbed
runts on a common. Fine folks they are to tell you what's right, as
look as if they'd never tasted nothing better than bacon-sword and
sour-cake i' their lives. But what did Mr. Irwine say to you about
that fool's trick o' preaching on the Green?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) only said he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)'d heard of it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) didn't seem to feel any
displeasure about it. But, dear aunt, don't think any more about
that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) told me something that I'm sure will cause you sorrow, as
it does me. Thias Bede was drowned last night in the Willow
Brook, and I'm thinking that the aged mother will be greatly in
need of comfort. Perhaps I can be of use to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), so I have fetched
my bonnet and am going to set out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Dear heart, dear heart! But you must have a cup o' tea first,



<p/>126

<p/>child,'' said Mrs. Poyser, falling at once from the key of B with five
sharps to the frank and genial C. ``The kettle's boiling--we'll have
it ready in a minute; and the young uns 'ull be in and wanting
theirs directly. I'm quite willing you should go and see th' old
woman, for you're one as is allays welcome in trouble, Methodist
or no Methodist; but, for the matter o' that, it's the flesh and blood
folks are made on as makes the difference. Some cheeses are
made o' skimmed milk and some o' new milk, and it's no matter
what you call ’em, you may tell which is which by the look and the
smell. But as to Thias Bede, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>)'s better out o' the way nor in--God
forgi' me for saying so--for he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s done little this ten year but make
trouble for them as belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); and I think it 'ud be well for
you to take a little bottle o' rum for th' old woman, for I daresay
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s got never a drop o' nothing to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) inside. Sit down,
child, and be easy, for you shan't stir out till you've had a cup o'
tea, and so I tell you.''
During the latter part of this speech, Mrs. Poyser had been
reaching down the tea-things from the shelves, and was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
way towards the pantry for the loaf -LRB-followed close by Totty, who
had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) appearance on the rattling of the tea-cups-RRB-, when
Hetty came out of the dairy relieving her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) tired arms by lifting them
up, and clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hands at the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) head.
``Molly,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said, rather languidly, ``just run out and get me a
bunch of dock-leaves: the butter's ready to pack up now.''
``D’ you hear what's happened, Hetty?'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt.
``No; how should I hear anything?'' was the answer, in a pettish
tone.
``Not as you'd care much, I daresay, if you did hear; for you're
too feather-headed to mind if everybody was dead, so as you could



<p/>127

<p/>stay upstairs a-dressing yourself for two hours by the clock. But
anybody besides yourself 'ud mind about such things happening to
them as think a deal more of you than you deserve. But Adam
Bede and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) kin might be drownded for what you'd care--
you'd be perking at the glass the next minute.''
``Adam Bede--drowned?'' said Hetty, letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) arms fall and
looking rather bewildered, but suspecting that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt was as
usual exaggerating with a didactic purpose.
``No, my dear, no,'' said Dinah kindly, for Mrs. Poyser had
passed on to the pantry without deigning more precise
information. ``Not Adam. Adam's father, the old man, is drowned.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was drowned last night in the Willow Brook. Mr. Irwine has
just told me about it.''
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, how dreadful!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Hetty, looking serious, but not deeply
affected; and as Molly now entered with the dock-leaves, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) took
them silently and returned to the dairy without asking further
questions.




<p/>128

<p/>Chapter IX
Hetty's World

<p/>W

<p/>hile she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) adjusted the broad leaves that set off the pale
fragrant butter as the primrose is set off by its nest of
green I am afraid Hetty was thinking a great deal more
of the looks Captain Donnithorne had cast at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) than of Adam
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) troubles. Bright, admiring glances from a handsome young
gentleman with white hands, a gold chain, occasional regimentals,
and wealth and grandeur immeasurable--those were the warm
rays that set poor Hetty's heart vibrating and playing its little
foolish tunes over and over again. We do not hear that Memnon's
statue gave forth its melody at all under the rushing of the
mightiest wind, or in response to any other influence divine or
human than certain short-lived sunbeams of morning; and we
must learn to accommodate ourselves to the discovery that some
of those cunningly fashioned instruments called human souls have
only a very limited range of music, and will not vibrate in the least
under a touch that fills others with tremulous rapture or quivering
agony.
Hetty was quite used to the thought that people liked to look at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was not blind to the fact that young Luke Britton of
Broxton came to Hayslope Church on a Sunday afternoon on
purpose that he (<font color='blue'><b>Britton</b></font>) might see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>); and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Britton</b></font>) would have made
much more decided advances if her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) uncle Poyser, thinking but
lightly of a young man whose father's land was so foul as old Luke
Britton's, had not forbidden her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt to encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Britton</b></font>) by any




<p/>129

<p/>civilities. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was aware, too, that Mr. Craig, the gardener at the
Chase, was over head and ears in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), and had lately
made unmistakable avowals in luscious strawberries and
hyperbolical peas. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knew still better, that Adam Bede--tall,
upright, clever, brave Adam Bede--who carried such authority
with all the people round about, and whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) uncle was always
delighted to see of an evening, saying that <div class="bookquote">``Adam knew a fine
sight more o' the natur o' things than those as thought themselves
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) betters'' (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knew that this Adam, who was often rather stern
to other people and not much given to run after the lasses, could
be made to turn pale or red any day by a word or a look from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>).
Hetty's sphere of comparison was not large, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) couldn't help
perceiving that Adam was <div class="bookquote">``something like''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>a man; always knew
what to say about things, could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) uncle how to prop the
hovel, and had mended the churn in no time; knew, with only
looking at it, the value of the chestnut-tree that was blown down,
and why the damp came in the walls, and what they must do to
stop the rats; and wrote a beautiful hand that you could read off,
and could do figures in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) head--a degree of accomplishment
totally unknown among the richest farmers of that countryside.
Not at all like that slouching Luke Britton, who, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) once
walked with him (<font color='blue'><b>Britton</b></font>) all the way from Broxton to Hayslope, had only
broken silence to remark that the grey goose had begun to lay.
And as for Mr. Craig, the gardener, he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) was a sensible man enough,
to be sure, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) was knock-kneed, and had a queer sort of singsong in his (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) talk; moreover, on the most charitable supposition, he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>)
must be far on the way to forty.
Hetty was quite certain her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) uncle wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to encourage
Adam, and would be pleased for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). For those were



<p/>130

<p/>times when there was no rigid demarcation of rank between the
farmer and the respectable artisan, and on the home hearth, as
well as in the public house, they might be seen taking their jug of
ale together; the farmer having a latent sense of capital, and of
weight in parish affairs, which sustained him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) under his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)
conspicuous inferiority in conversation. Martin Poyser was not a
frequenter of public houses, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) liked a friendly chat over his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
own home-brewed; and though it was pleasant to lay down the law
to a stupid neighbour who had no notion how to make the best of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) farm, it was also an agreeable variety to learn something from
a clever fellow like Adam Bede. Accordingly, for the last three
years--ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) had superintended the building of the new
barn--Adam had always been made welcome at the Hall Farm,
especially of a winter evening, when the whole family, in
patriarchal fashion, master and mistress, children and servants,
were assembled in that glorious kitchen, at well-graduated
distances from the blazing fire. And for the last two years, at least,
Hetty had been in the habit of hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) uncle say, <div class="bookquote">``Adam Bede
may be working for wage now, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>)'ll be a master-man some
day, as sure as I sit in this chair. Mester Burge is in the right on 't
to want him (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) to go partners and marry his (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) daughter, if it's true
what they say; the woman as marries him (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) 'ull have a good take,
be't Lady-day or Michaelmas,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>a remark which Mrs. Poyser
always followed up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) cordial assent. <div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) would say,
``it's all very fine having a ready-made rich man, but mayhappen
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll be a ready-made fool; and it's no use filling your pocket full o'
money if you've got a hole in the corner. It'll do you no good to sit
in a spring-cart o' your own, if you've got a soft to drive you: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll
soon turn you over into the ditch. I allays said I'd never marry a



<p/>131

<p/>man as had got no brains; for where's the use of a woman having
brains of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s tackled to a geck as everybody's alaughing at? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might as well dress herself fine to sit back'ards
on a donkey.''
These expressions, though figurative, sufficiently indicated the
bent of Mrs. Poyser's mind with regard to Adam; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) husband might have viewed the subject differently if
Hetty had been a daughter of their own, it was clear that they
would have welcomed the match with Adam for a penniless niece.
For what could Hetty have been but a servant elsewhere, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
uncle had not taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) in and brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) up as a domestic help
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt, whose health since the birth of Totty had not been
equal to more positive labour than the superintendence of
servants and children? But Hetty had never given Adam any
steady encouragement. Even in the moments when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was most
thoroughly conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) superiority to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) other admirers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
had never brought herself to think of accepting him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) liked to
feel that this strong, skilful, keen-eyed man was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) power, and
would have been indignant if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had shown the least sign of
slipping from under the yoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) coquettish tyranny and
attaching himself to the gentle Mary Burge, who would have been
grateful enough for the most trifling notice from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Mary
Burge, indeed! Such a sallow-faced girl: if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) put on a bit of pink
ribbon, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked as yellow as a crow-flower and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair was as
straight as a hank of cotton.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And always when Adam stayed away
for several weeks from the Hall Farm, and otherwise made some
show of resistance to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) passion as a foolish one, Hetty took care
to entice him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) back into the net by little airs of meekness and
timidity, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) were in trouble at his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) neglect. But as to marrying



<p/>132

<p/>Adam, that was a very different affair! There was nothing in the
world to tempt her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to do that. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cheeks never grew a shade
deeper when his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) name was mentioned; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt no thrill when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) passing along the causeway by the window, or advancing
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) unexpectedly in the footpath across the meadow; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
felt nothing, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) eyes rested on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), but the cold triumph of
knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and would not care to look at Mary
Burge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could no more stir in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) the emotions that make the
sweet intoxication of young love than the mere picture of a sun
can stir the spring sap in the subtle fibres of the plant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was--a poor man with old parents to keep, who would
not be able, for a long while to come, to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) even such
luxuries as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) shared in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) uncle's house. And Hetty's dreams
were all of luxuries: to sit in a carpeted parlour, and always wear
white stockings; to have some large beautiful ear-rings, such as
were all the fashion; to have Nottingham lace round the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
gown, and something to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) handkerchief smell nice, like
Miss Lydia Donnithorne's when she (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) drew it out at church; and not
to be obliged to get up early or be scolded by anybody. She (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>)
thought, if Adam had been rich and could have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) these
things, she (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) well enough to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>).
But for the last few weeks a new influence had come over
Hetty--vague, atmospheric, shaping itself into no self-confessed
hopes or prospects, but producing a pleasant narcotic effect,
making her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) tread the ground and go about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) work in a sort of
dream, unconscious of weight or effort, and showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) all things
through a soft, liquid veil, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) were living not in this solid
world of brick and stone, but in a beatified world, such as the sun
lights up for us in the waters. Hetty had become aware that Mr.



<p/>133

<p/>Arthur Donnithorne would take a good deal of trouble for the
chance of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>); that he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) always placed himself at church so as
to have the fullest view of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) both sitting and standing; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>)
was constantly finding reason for calling at the Hall Farm, and
always would contrive to say something for the sake of making her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) and look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>). The poor child no more conceived at
present the idea that the young squire could ever be her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) lover than
a baker's pretty daughter in the crowd, whom a young emperor
distinguishes by an imperial but admiring smile, conceives that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) shall be made empress. But the baker's daughter goes home
and dreams of the handsome young emperor, and perhaps weighs
the flour amiss while she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is thinking what a heavenly lot it must be
to have him (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>) for a husband. And so, poor Hetty had got a face and a
presence haunting her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) waking and sleeping dreams; bright, soft
glances had penetrated her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), and suffused her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) life with a strange,
happy languor. The eyes that shed those glances were really not
half so fine as Adam's, which sometimes looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) with a sad,
beseeching tenderness, but they had found a ready medium in
Hetty's little silly imagination, whereas Adam's could get no
entrance through that atmosphere. For three weeks, at least, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
inward life had consisted of little else than living through in
memory the looks and words Arthur had directed towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)--of
little else than recalling the sensations with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
voice outside the house, and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) enter, and became conscious
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) eyes were fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), and then became conscious that a
tall figure, looking down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) with eyes that seemed to touch
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), was coming nearer in clothes of beautiful texture with an
odour like that of a flower-garden borne on the evening breeze.
Foolish thoughts! But all this happened, you must remember,



<p/>134

<p/>nearly sixty years ago, and Hetty was quite uneducated--a simple
farmer's girl, to whom a gentleman with a white hand was
dazzling as an Olympian god. Until to-day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had never looked
farther into the future than to the next time Captain Donnithorne
would come to the Farm, or the next Sunday when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) should see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) at church; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thought, perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) would try to meet
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) went to the Chase to-morrow--and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) should
speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), and walk a little way, when nobody was by! That had
never happened yet; and now her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) imagination, instead of retracing
the past, was busy fashioning what would happen to-morrow--
whereabout in the Chase she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) should see him (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) coming towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>),
how she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) should put her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) new rose-coloured ribbon on, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>)
had never seen, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) would say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) return
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) glance--a glance which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would be living through in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
memory, over and over again, all the rest of the day.
In this state of mind, how could Hetty give any feeling to
Adam's troubles, or think much about poor old Thias being
drowned? Young souls, in such pleasant delirium as hers are as
unsympathetic as butterflies sipping nectar; they are isolated from
all appeals by a barrier of dreams--by invisible looks and
impalpable arms.
While Hetty's hands were busy packing up the butter, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
head filled with these pictures of the morrow, Arthur
Donnithorne, riding by Mr. Irwine's side towards the valley of the
Willow Brook, had also certain indistinct anticipations, running as
an undercurrent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) mind while he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) was listening to Mr. Irwine's
account of Dinah--indistinct, yet strong enough to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) feel
rather conscious when Mr. Irwine suddenly said,
``What fascinated you so in Mrs. Poyser's dairy, Arthur? Have



<p/>135

<p/>you become an amateur of damp quarries and skimming dishes?''
Arthur knew the rector too well to suppose that a clever
invention would be of any use, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) accustomed
frankness,
``No, I went to look at the pretty butter-maker Hetty Sorrel.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>)'s a perfect Hebe; and if I were an artist, I would paint her (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>). It's
amazing what pretty girls one sees among the farmers' daughters,
when the men are such clowns. That common, round, red face one
sees sometimes in the men--all cheek and no features, like Martin
Poyser's--comes out in the women of the family as the most
charming phiz imaginable.''
``Well, I have no objection to your contemplating Hetty in an
artistic light, but I must not have you feeding her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) vanity and filling
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) little noddle with the notion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s a great beauty,
attractive to fine gentlemen, or you will spoil her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) for a poor man's
wife--honest Craig's, for example, whom I have seen bestowing
soft glances on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). The little puss seems already to have airs
enough to make a husband as miserable as it's a law of nature for
a quiet man to be when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) marries a beauty. Apropos of marrying,
I hope our friend Adam will get settled, now the poor old man's
gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) will only have his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother to keep in future, and I've a
notion that there's a kindness between him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) and that nice modest
girl, Mary Burge, from something that fell from old Jonathan one
day when I was talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>). But when I mentioned the subject
to Adam he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) looked uneasy and turned the conversation. I suppose
the love-making doesn't run smooth, or perhaps Adam hangs back
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'s in a better position. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) has independence of spirit enough
for two men--rather an excess of pride, if anything.''
``That would be a capital match for Adam. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would slip into



<p/>136

<p/>old Burge's shoes and make a fine thing of that building business,
I'll answer for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). I should like to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) well settled in this
parish; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would be ready then to act as my grand-vizier when I
wanted one. We could plan no end of repairs and improvements
together. I've never seen the girl, though, I think--at least I've
never looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''
``Look at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) next Sunday at church--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sits with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father
on the left of the reading-desk. You needn't look quite so much at
Hetty Sorrel then. When I've made up my mind that I can't afford
to buy a tempting dog, I take no notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), because if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took a
strong fancy to me and looked lovingly at me, the struggle between
arithmetic and inclination might become unpleasantly severe. I
pique myself on my wisdom there, Arthur, and as an old fellow to
whom wisdom had become cheap, I bestow it upon you.''
<div class="bookquote">``Thank you. It may stand me in good stead some day though I
don't know that I have any present use for it. Bless me! How the
brook has overflowed. Suppose we have a canter, now we're at the
bottom of the hill.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That is the great advantage of dialogue on horseback; it can be
merged any minute into a trot or a canter, and one might have
escaped from Socrates himself in the saddle. The two friends were
free from the necessity of further conversation till they pulled up
in the lane behind Adam's cottage.

<p/>t five o’clock Lisbeth came downstairs with a large key in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) hand: it was the key of the chamber where her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>)
husband lay dead. Throughout the day, except in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>)
occasional outbursts of wailing grief, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) had been in incessant
movement, performing the initial duties to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) dead with the awe
and exactitude that belong to religious rites. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) had brought out
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) little store of bleached linen, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) had for long years kept
in reserve for this supreme use. It seemed but yesterday--that
time so many midsummers ago, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) had told Thias where
this linen lay, that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might be sure and reach it out for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) died, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) was the elder of the two. Then there had been the
work of cleansing to the strictest purity every object in the sacred
chamber, and of removing from it every trace of common daily
occupation. The small window, which had hitherto freely let in the
frosty moonlight or the warm summer sunrise on the working
man's slumber, must now be darkened with a fair white sheet, for
this was the sleep which is as sacred under the bare rafters as in
ceiled houses. Lisbeth had even mended a long-neglected and
unnoticeable rent in the checkered bit of bed-curtain; for the
moments were few and precious now in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) would be able
to do the smallest office of respect or love for the still corpse, to
which in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) thoughts she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) attributed some consciousness. Our
dead are never dead to us until we have forgotten them: they can
be injured by us, they can be wounded; they know all our




<p/>138

<p/>penitence, all our aching sense that their place is empty, all the
kisses we bestow on the smallest relic of their presence. And the
aged peasant woman most of all believes that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dead are
conscious. Decent burial was what Lisbeth had been thinking of
for herself through years of thrift, with an indistinct expectation
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) should know when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) was being carried to the
churchyard, followed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) husband and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) sons; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>)
felt as if the greatest work of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) life were to be done in seeing that
Thias was buried decently before her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>)--under the white thorn,
where once, in a dream, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) had thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) lay in the coffin, yet
all the while saw the sunshine above and smelt the white blossoms
that were so thick upon the thorn the Sunday she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) went to be
churched after Adam was born.
But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) had done everything that could be done to-day in
the chamber of death--had done it all herself, with some aid from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) sons in lifting, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) would let no one be fetched to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>)
from the village, not being fond of female neighbours generally;
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) favourite Dolly, the old housekeeper at Mr. Burge's, who
had come to condole with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) in the morning as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) heard
of Thias's death, was too dim-sighted to be of much use. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had
locked the door, and now held the key in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) hand, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) threw
herself wearily into a chair that stood out of its place in the middle
of the house floor, where in ordinary times she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) would never have
consented to sit. The kitchen had had none of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) attention that
day; it was soiled with the tread of muddy shoes and untidy with
clothes and other objects out of place. But what at another time
would have been intolerable to Lisbeth's habits of order and
cleanliness seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) now just what should be: it was right
that things should look strange and disordered and wretched, now



<p/>139

<p/>the old man had come to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) end in that sad way; the kitchen
ought not to look as if nothing had happened. Adam, overcome
with the agitations and exertions of the day after his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) night of hard
work, had fallen asleep on a bench in the workshop; and Seth was
in the back kitchen making a fire of sticks that he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) might get the
kettle to boil, and persuade his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) mother to have a cup of tea, an
indulgence which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rarely allowed herself.
There was no one in the kitchen when Lisbeth entered and
threw herself into the chair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) looked round with blank eyes at
the dirt and confusion on which the bright afternoon's sun shone
dismally; it was all of a piece with the sad confusion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) mind--
that confusion which belongs to the first hours of a sudden sorrow,
when the poor human soul is like one who has been deposited
sleeping among the ruins of a vast city, and wakes up in dreary
amazement, not knowing whether it is the growing or the dying
day--not knowing why and whence came this illimitable scene of
desolation, or why he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) too finds himself desolate in the midst of it.
At another time Lisbeth's first thought would have been,
<div class="bookquote">``Where is Adam?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>but the sudden death of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) husband had
restored him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in these hours to that first place in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) affections
which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had held six-and-twenty years ago. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) had forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
faults as we forget the sorrows of our departed childhood, and
thought of nothing but the young husband's kindness and the old
man's patience. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) eyes continued to wander blankly until Seth
came in and began to remove some of the scattered things, and
clear the small round deal table that he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) might set out his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) mother's
tea upon it.
<div class="bookquote">``What art goin' to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, rather peevishly.
<div class="bookquote">``I want thee to have a cup of tea, Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>answered Seth,



<p/>140

<p/>tenderly. <div class="bookquote">``It'll do thee good; and I'll put two or three of these
things away, and make the house look more comfortable.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Comfortable! How canst talk o' ma’in' things comfortable? Let
a-be, let a-be. There's no comfort for me no more,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went on,
the tears coming when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) began to speak, <div class="bookquote">``now thy poor
feyther's gone, as I’n washed for and mended, an' got's victual for
him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) for thirty 'ear, an' him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) allays so pleased wi' iverything I done
for him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), an' used to be so handy an' do the jobs for me when I war
ill an' cumbered wi' th' babby, an' made me the posset an' brought
it upstairs as proud as could be, an' carried the lad as war as heavy
as two children for five mile an' ne’er grumbled, all the way to
Warson Wake, ’cause I wanted to go an' see my sister, as war dead
an' gone the very next Christmas as e'er come. An' him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) to be
drownded in the brook as we passed o’er the day we war married
an' come home together, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'d made them lots o' shelves for me
to put my plates an' things on, an' showed ’em me as proud as
could be, ’cause he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) know'd I should be pleased. An' he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) war to die
an' me not to know, but to be a-sleepin' i' my bed, as if I caredna
nought about it. Eh! An' me to live to see that! An' us as war young
folks once, an' thought we should do rarely when we war married.
Let a-be, lad, let a-be! I wonna ha' no tay. I carena if I ne’er ate nor
drink no more. When one end o' th' bridge tumbles down, where's
th' use o' th' other stannin'? I may 's well die, an' foller my old
man. There's no knowin' but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll want me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Here Lisbeth broke from words into moans, swaying herself
backwards and forwards on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) chair. Seth, always timid in his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)
behaviour towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) mother, from the sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had no
influence over her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), felt it was useless to attempt to persuade or
soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) till this passion was past; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) contented himself with



<p/>141

<p/>tending the back kitchen fire and folding up his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) father's clothes,
which had been hanging out to dry since morning--afraid to move
about in the room where his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) mother was, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) should irritate
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) further.
But after Lisbeth had been rocking herself and moaning for
some minutes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) suddenly paused and said aloud to herself, <div class="bookquote">``I'll
go an' see arter Adam, for I canna think where he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'s gotten; an' I
want him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to go upstairs wi' me afore it's dark, for the minutes to
look at the corpse is like the meltin' snow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Seth overheard this, and coming into the kitchen again, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)
mother rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) chair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Adam's asleep in the
workshop, mother. Thee'dst better not wake him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was
o’erwrought with work and trouble.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wake him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)? Who's a-goin' to wake him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)? I shanna wake him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) wi'
lookin' at him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). I hanna seen the lad this two hour--I'd welly forgot
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'d e'er growed up from a babby when's feyther carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam was seated on a rough bench, his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) head supported by his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
arm, which rested from the shoulder to the elbow on the long
planing-table in the middle of the workshop. It seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had
sat down for a few minutes' rest and had fallen asleep without
slipping from his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) first attitude of sad, fatigued thought. His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) face,
unwashed since yesterday, looked pallid and clammy; his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hair was
tossed shaggily about his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) forehead, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) closed eyes had the
sunken look which follows upon watching and sorrow. His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) brow
was knit, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) whole face had an expression of weariness and
pain. Gyp was evidently uneasy, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) sat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) haunches, resting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) nose on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) master's stretched-out leg, and dividing the time
between licking the hand that hung listlessly down and glancing
with a listening air towards the door. The poor dog was hungry



<p/>142

<p/>and restless, but would not leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) master, and was waiting
impatiently for some change in the scene. It was owing to this
feeling on Gyp's part that, when Lisbeth came into the workshop
and advanced towards Adam as noiselessly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) could, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>)
intention not to awaken him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was immediately defeated; for Gyp's
excitement was too great to find vent in anything short of a sharp
bark, and in a moment Adam opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) eyes and saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother
standing before him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). It was not very unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) dream, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) sleep
had been little more than living through again, in a fevered
delirious way, all that had happened since daybreak, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
mother with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fretful grief was present to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) through it all. The
chief difference between the reality and the vision was that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
dream Hetty was continually coming before him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) in bodily
presence--strangely mingling herself as an actor in scenes with
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had nothing to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was even by the Willow Brook;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) mother angry by coming into the house; and he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) met
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) smart clothes quite wet through, as he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) walked in the
rain to Treddleston, to tell the coroner. But wherever Hetty came,
his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) mother was sure to follow soon; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) eyes,
it was not at all startling to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) standing near him (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Eh, my lad, my lad!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>Lisbeth burst out immediately, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
wailing impulse returning, for grief in its freshness feels the need
of associating its loss and its lament with every change of scene
and incident, ``thee 'st got nobody now but thy old mother to
torment thee and be a burden to thee. Thy poor feyther 'ull ne’er
anger thee no more; an' thy mother may 's well go arter him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)--the
sooner the better--for I'm no good to nobody now. One old coat
'ull do to patch another, but it's good for nought else. Thee 'dst like
t' ha' a wife to mend thy clothes an' get thy victual, better nor thy



<p/>143

<p/>old mother. An' I shall be nought but cumber, a-sittin' i' th'
chimney-corner. -LRB-Adam winced and moved uneasily; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) dreaded,
of all things, to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother speak of Hetty.-RRB- But if thy feyther
had lived, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'d ne’er ha' wanted me to go to make room for
another, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could no more ha' done wi’out me nor one side o'
the scithers can do wi’out th' tother. Eh, we should ha' been both
flung away together, an' then I shouldna ha' seen this day, an' one
buryin' 'ud ha' done for us both.''
Here Lisbeth paused, but Adam sat in pained silence--he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could
not speak otherwise than tenderly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother to-day, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
could not help being irritated by this plaint. It was not possible for
poor Lisbeth to know how it affected Adam any more than it is
possible for a wounded dog to know how his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) moans affect the
nerves of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) master. Like all complaining women, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) complained
in the expectation of being soothed, and when Adam said nothing,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) was only prompted to complain more bitterly.
<div class="bookquote">``I know thee couldst do better wi’out me, for thee couldst go
where thee likedst an' marry them as thee likedst. But I donna
want to say thee nay, let thee bring home who thee wut; I'd ne’er
open my lips to find faut, for when folks is old an' o' no use, they
may think theirsens well off to get the bit an' the sup, though
they’n to swallow ill words wi't. An' if thee 'st set thy heart on a
lass as'll bring thee nought and waste all, when thee mightst ha'
them as 'ud make a man on thee, I'll say nought, now thy feyther's
dead an' drownded, for I'm no better nor an old haft when the
blade's gone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Adam, unable to bear this any longer, rose silently from the
bench and walked out of the workshop into the kitchen. But
Lisbeth followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>).



<p/>144

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thee wutna go upstairs an' see thy feyther then? I’n done
everythin' now, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d like thee to go an' look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) war
allays so pleased when thee wast mild to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam turned round at once and said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, mother; let us go
upstairs. Come, Seth, let us go together.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>They went upstairs, and for five minutes all was silence. Then
the key was turned again, and there was a sound of footsteps on
the stairs. But Adam did not come down again; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was too weary
and worn-out to encounter more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother's querulous grief,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) went to rest on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) bed. Lisbeth no sooner entered the
kitchen and sat down than she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) apron over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) head, and
began to cry and moan and rock herself as before. Seth thought,
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will be quieter by and by, now we have been upstairs'' (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) went into the back kitchen again, to tend his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) little fire, hoping
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) should presently induce her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) to have some tea.
Lisbeth had been rocking herself in this way for more than five
minutes, giving a low moan with every forward movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>)
body, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) suddenly felt a hand placed gently on hers, and a
sweet treble voice said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Dear sister, the Lord has sent me
to see if I can be a comfort to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Lisbeth paused, in a listening attitude, without removing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>)
apron from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) face. The voice was strange to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>). Could it be her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>)
sister's spirit come back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) from the dead after all those years?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) trembled and dared not look.
Dinah, believing that this pause of wonder was in itself a relief
for the sorrowing woman, said no more just yet, but quietly took
off her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bonnet, and then, motioning silence to Seth, who, on
hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice, had come in with a beating heart, laid one hand
on the back of Lisbeth's chair and leaned over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) might



<p/>145

<p/>be aware of a friendly presence.
Slowly Lisbeth drew down her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) apron, and timidly she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) opened
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) dim dark eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) saw nothing at first but a face--a pure,
pale face, with loving grey eyes, and it was quite unknown to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>).
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) wonder increased; perhaps it was an angel. But in the same
instant Dinah had laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hand on Lisbeth's again, and the old
woman looked down at it. It was a much smaller hand than her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
own, but it was not white and delicate, for Dinah had never worn a
glove in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) life, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hand bore the traces of labour from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
childhood upwards. Lisbeth looked earnestly at the hand for a
moment, and then, fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) eyes again on Dinah's face, said, with
something of restored courage, but in a tone of surprise, <div class="bookquote">``Why,
ye're a workin' woman!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am Dinah Morris, and I work in the cotton-mill when I
am at home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Lisbeth slowly, still wondering; <div class="bookquote">``ye comed in so
light, like the shadow on the wall, an' spoke i' my ear, as I thought
ye might be a sperrit. Ye've got a'most the face o' one as is a-sittin'
on the grave i' Adam's new Bible.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I come from the Hall Farm now. You know Mrs. Poyser--she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)'s
my aunt, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) has heard of your great affliction, and is very
sorry; and I'm come to see if I can be any help to you in your
trouble; for I know your sons Adam and Seth, and I know you
have no daughter; and when the clergyman told me how the hand
of God was heavy upon you, my heart went out towards you, and I
felt a command to come and be to you in the place of a daughter in
this grief, if you will let me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I know who y' are now; y' are a Methody, like Seth; he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)'s
tould me on you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Lisbeth fretfully, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) overpowering sense of



<p/>146

<p/>pain returning, now her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) wonder was gone. <div class="bookquote">``Ye'll make it out as
trouble's a good thing, like he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) allays does. But where's the use o'
talkin' to me a-that’n? Ye canna make the smart less wi' talkin'.
Ye'll ne’er make me believe as it's better for me not to ha' my old
man die in's bed, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must die, an' ha' the parson to pray by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
an' me to sit by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), an' tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ne’er to mind th' ill words I've
gi’en him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sometimes when I war angered, an' to gi' him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a bit an' a
sup, as long as a bit an' a sup he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d swallow. But eh! To die i' the
cold water, an' us close to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), an' ne’er to know; an' me asleepin', as if I ne’er belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no more nor if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d been a
journeyman tramp from nobody knows where!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>Here Lisbeth began to cry and rock herself again; and Dinah
said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear friend, your affliction is great. It would be
hardness of heart to say that your trouble was not heavy to bear.
God didn't send me to you to make light of your sorrow, but to
mourn with you, if you will let me. If you had a table spread for a
feast, and was making merry with your friends, you would think it
was kind to let me come and sit down and rejoice with you,
because you'd think I should like to share those good things; but I
should like better to share in your trouble and your labour, and it
would seem harder to me if you denied me that. You won't send
me away? You're not angry with me for coming?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>``Nay, nay; angered! who said I war angered? It war good on
you to come. An' Seth, why donna ye get her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) some tay? Ye war in

gettin' 't for them as wants it. Sit ye down; sit ye down. I thank you
kindly for comin', for it's little wage ye get by walkin' through the
wet fields to see an old woman like me ... Nay, I’n got no daughter
o' my own--ne’er had one--an' I warna sorry, for they're poor



<p/>147

<p/>queechy things, gells is; I allays wanted to ha' lads, as could fend
for theirsens. An' the lads 'ull be marryin'--I shall ha' daughters
eno', an' too many. But now, do ye make the tay as ye like it, for I’n
got no taste i' my mouth this day--it's all one what I swaller--it's
all got the taste o' sorrow wi't.''
Dinah took care not to betray that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had had her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) tea, and
accepted Lisbeth's invitation very readily, for the sake of
persuading the old woman herself to take the food and drink she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
so much needed after a day of hard work and fasting.
Seth was so happy now Dinah was in the house that he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) could
not help thinking her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) presence was worth purchasing with a life in
which grief incessantly followed upon grief; but the next moment
he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) reproached himself--it was almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) were rejoicing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)
father's sad death. Nevertheless the joy of being with Dinah would
triumph--it was like the influence of climate, which no resistance
can overcome. And the feeling even suffused itself over his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) face so
as to attract his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) mother's notice, while she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was drinking her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tea.
``Thee may 'st well talk o' trouble bein' a good thing, Seth, for
thee thriv'st on 't. Thee look'st as if thee know'dst no more o' care
an' cumber nor when thee wast a babby a-lyin' awake i' th' cradle.
For thee'dst allays lie still wi' thy eyes open, an' Adam ne’er 'ud lie
still a minute when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) wakened. Thee wast allays like a bag o'
meal as can ne’er be bruised--though, for the matter o' that, thy
poor feyther war just such another. But ye've got the same look
too'' -LRB-here Lisbeth turned to Dinah-RRB-. ``I reckon it's wi' bein' a
Methody. Not as I'm a-findin' faut wi' ye for 't, for ye've no call to
be frettin', an' somehow ye looken sorry too. Eh! Well, if the
Methodies are fond o' trouble, they're like to thrive: it's a pity they
canna ha't all, an' take it away from them as donna like it. I could



<p/>148

<p/>ha' gi’en ’em plenty; for when I'd gotten my old man I war
worreted from morn till night; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s gone, I'd be glad for
the worst o’er again.''
``Yes,'' said Dinah, careful not to oppose any feeling of
Lisbeth's, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) reliance, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) smallest words and deeds, on a
divine guidance, always issued in that finest woman's tact which
proceeds from acute and ready sympathy; ``yes, I remember too,
when my dear aunt died, I longed for the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) bad cough
in the nights, instead of the silence that came when she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was gone.
But now, dear friend, drink this other cup of tea and eat a little
more.''
``What!'' said Lisbeth, taking the cup and speaking in a less
querulous tone, ``had ye got no feyther and mother, then, as ye war
so sorry about your aunt?''
``No, I never knew a father or mother; my aunt brought me up
from a baby. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had no children, for she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was never married and
she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) brought me up as tenderly as if I'd been her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) own child.''
<div class="bookquote">``Eh, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)'d fine work wi' ye, I'll warrant, bringin' ye up from a
babby, an' her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) a lone woman--it's ill bringin' up a cade lamb. But I
daresay ye warna franzy, for ye look as if ye'd ne’er been angered
i' your life. But what did ye do when your aunt died, an' why didna
ye come to live in this country, bein' as Mrs. Poyser's your aunt
too?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Dinah, seeing that Lisbeth's attention was attracted, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
the story of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) early life--how she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had been brought up to work
hard, and what sort of place Snowfield was, and how many people
had a hard life there--all the details that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) thought likely to
interest Lisbeth. The old woman listened, and forgot to be fretful,
unconsciously subject to the soothing influence of Dinah's face



<p/>149

<p/>and voice. After a while she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was persuaded to let the kitchen be
made tidy; for Dinah was bent on this, believing that the sense of
order and quietude around her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would help in disposing Lisbeth to
join in the prayer she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) longed to pour forth at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) side. Seth,
meanwhile, went out to chop wood, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) surmised that Dinah
would like to be left alone with his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) mother.
Lisbeth sat watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) moved about in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) still quick
way, and said at last, <div class="bookquote">``Ye've got a notion o' cleanin' up. I wouldna
mind ha’in ye for a daughter, for ye wouldna spend the lad's wage
i' fine clothes an' waste. Ye're not like the lasses o' this
countryside. I reckon folks is different at Snowfield from what
they are here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They have a different sort of life, many of ’em,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>said Dinah;
<div class="bookquote">``they work at different things--some in the mill, and many in the
mines, in the villages round about. But the heart of man is the
same everywhere, and there are the children of this world and the
children of light there as well as elsewhere. But we've many more
Methodists there than in this country.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I didna know as the Methody women war like ye, for
there's Will Maskery's wife, as they say's a big Methody, isna
pleasant to look at, at all. I'd as lief look at a tooad. An' I'm thinkin'
I wouldna mind if ye'd stay an' sleep here, for I should like to see
ye i' th' house i' th' mornin'. But mayhappen they'll be lookin for
ye at Mester Poyser's.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>said Dinah, <div class="bookquote">``they don't expect me, and I should like to
stay, if you'll let me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>``Well, there's room; I’n got my bed laid i' th' little room o’er the
back kitchen, an' ye can lie beside me. I'd be glad to ha' ye wi' me
to speak to i' th' night, for ye've got a nice way o' talkin'. It puts me



<p/>150

<p/>i' mind o' the swallows as was under the thack last 'ear when they
fust begun to sing low an' soft-like i' th' mornin'. Eh, but my old
man war fond o' them birds! An' so war Adam, but they’n ne’er
comed again this 'ear. Happen they're dead too.''
``There,'' said Dinah, ``now the kitchen looks tidy, and now, dear
Mother--for I'm your daughter to-night, you know--I should like
you to wash your face and have a clean cap on. Do you remember
what David did, when God took away his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) child from him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)? While
the child was yet alive he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fasted and prayed to God to spare it, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would neither eat nor drink, but lay on the ground all night,
beseeching God for the child. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knew it was dead, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
rose up from the ground and washed and anointed himself, and
changed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) clothes, and ate and drank; and when they asked him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
how it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) seemed to have left off grieving now the child
was dead, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, `While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept;
for I said, Who can tell whether God will be gracious to me, that
the child may live? But now he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is dead, wherefore should I fast?
Can I bring him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) back again? I shall go to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shall not
return to me.'''
<div class="bookquote">``Eh, that's a true word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Lisbeth. ``Yea, my old man wonna
come back to me, but I shall go to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--the sooner the better.
Well, ye may do as ye like wi' me: there's a clean cap i' that
drawer, an' I'll go i' the back kitchen an' wash my face. An' Seth,
thee may 'st reach down Adam's new Bible wi' th' picters in, an'
she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) shall read us a chapter. Eh, I like them words--`I shall go to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) wonna come back to me.'''
Dinah and Seth were both inwardly offering thanks for the
greater quietness of spirit that had come over Lisbeth. This was
what Dinah had been trying to bring about, through all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) still



<p/>151

<p/>sympathy and absence from exhortation. From her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) girlhood
upwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had had experience among the sick and the
mourning, among minds hardened and shrivelled through poverty
and ignorance, and had gained the subtlest perception of the mode
in which they could best be touched and softened into willingness
to receive words of spiritual consolation or warning. As Dinah
expressed it, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was never left to herself; but it was always given
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) when to keep silence and when to speak.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>And do we not all
agree to call rapid thought and noble impulse by the name of
inspiration? After our subtlest analysis of the mental process, we
must still say, as Dinah did, that our highest thoughts and our best
deeds are all given to us.
And so there was earnest prayer--there was faith, love, and
hope pouring forth that evening in the little kitchen. And poor,
aged, fretful Lisbeth, without grasping any distinct idea, without
going through any course of religious emotions, felt a vague sense
of goodness and love, and of something right lying underneath and
beyond all this sorrowing life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) couldn't understand the sorrow;
but, for these moments, under the subduing influence of Dinah's
spirit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) must be patient and still.




<p/>152

<p/>Chapter XI
In the Cottage

<p/>I

<p/>t was but half-past four the next morning when Dinah, tired of
lying awake listening to the birds and watching the growing
light through the little window in the garret roof, rose and
began to dress herself very quietly, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) should disturb Lisbeth.
But already some one else was astir in the house, and had gone
downstairs, preceded by Gyp. The dog's pattering step was a sure
sign that it was Adam who went down; but Dinah was not aware of
this, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) thought it was more likely to be Seth, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) how Adam had stayed up working the night before. Seth,
however, had only just awakened at the sound of the opening
door. The exciting influence of the previous day, heightened at last
by Dinah's unexpected presence, had not been counteracted by
any bodily weariness, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had not done his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) ordinary amount of
hard work; and so when he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) went to bed; it was not till he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had tired
himself with hours of tossing wakefulness that drowsiness came,
and led on a heavier morning sleep than was usual with him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>).
But Adam had been refreshed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) long rest, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
habitual impatience of mere passivity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was eager to begin the
new day and subdue sadness by his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) strong will and strong arm.
The white mist lay in the valley; it was going to be a bright warm
day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would start to work again when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had had his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
breakfast.
<div class="bookquote">``There's nothing but what's bearable as long as a man can
work,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said to himself; <div class="bookquote">``the natur o' things doesn't change,




<p/>153

<p/>though it seems as if one's own life was nothing but change. The
square o' four is sixteen, and you must lengthen your lever in
proportion to your weight, is as true when a man's miserable as
when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s happy; and the best o' working is, it gives you a grip
hold o' things outside your own lot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) dashed the cold water over his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) head and face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) felt
completely himself again, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) black eyes as keen as ever
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thick black hair all glistening with the fresh moisture, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
went into the workshop to look out the wood for his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father's coffin,
intending that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) and Seth should carry it with them to Jonathan
Burge's and have the coffin made by one of the workmen there, so
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) mother might not see and hear the sad task going forward
at home.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) had just gone into the workshop when his (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) quick ear
detected a light rapid foot on the stairs--certainly not his (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>)
mother's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) had been in bed and asleep when Dinah had come in,
in the evening, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) wondered whose step this could be. A
foolish thought came, and moved him (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) strangely. As if it could be
Hetty! She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was the last person likely to be in the house. And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>)
felt reluctant to go and look and have the clear proof that it was
some one else. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) stood leaning on a plank he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) had taken hold of,
listening to sounds which his (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) imagination interpreted for him (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) so
pleasantly that the keen strong face became suffused with a timid
tenderness. The light footstep moved about the kitchen, followed
by the sound of the sweeping brush, hardly making so much noise
as the lightest breeze that chases the autumn leaves along the
dusty path; and Adam's imagination saw a dimpled face, with dark
bright eyes and roguish smiles looking backward at this brush,
and a rounded figure just leaning a little to clasp the handle. A



<p/>154

<p/>very foolish thought--it could not be Hetty; but the only way of
dismissing such nonsense from his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) head was to go and see who it
was, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) fancy only got nearer and nearer to belief while he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
stood there listening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) loosed the plank and went to the kitchen
door.
<div class="bookquote">``How do you do, Adam Bede?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>said Dinah, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) calm treble,
pausing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) sweeping and fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) mild grave eyes upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I trust you feel rested and strengthened again to bear the
burden and heat of the day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was like dreaming of the sunshine and awaking in the
moonlight. Adam had seen Dinah several times, but always at the
Hall Farm, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was not very vividly conscious of any
woman's presence except Hetty's, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had only in the last day
or two begun to suspect that Seth was in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)
attention had not hitherto been drawn towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)
brother's sake. But now her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) slim figure, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) plain black gown, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) pale serene face impressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) with all the force that belongs
to a reality contrasted with a preoccupying fancy. For the first
moment or two he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) made no answer, but looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) with the
concentrated, examining glance which a man gives to an object in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has suddenly begun to be interested. Dinah, for the first
time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) life, felt a painful self-consciousness; there was
something in the dark penetrating glance of this strong man so
different from the mildness and timidity of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother Seth. A
faint blush came, which deepened as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) wondered at it. This
blush recalled Adam from his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) forgetfulness.
<div class="bookquote">``I was quite taken by surprise; it was very good of you to come
and see my mother in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, in a gentle grateful
tone, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) quick mind told him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) at once how she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) came to be



<p/>155

<p/>there. <div class="bookquote">``I hope my mother was thankful to have you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) added,
wondering rather anxiously what had been Dinah's reception.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>said Dinah, resuming her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) work, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seemed greatly
comforted after a while, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s had a good deal of rest in the
night, by times. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was fast asleep when I left her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who was it took the news to the Hall Farm?''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
thoughts reverting to some one there; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) wondered whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
had felt anything about it.
<div class="bookquote">``It was Mr. Irwine, the clergyman, told me, and my aunt was
grieved for your mother when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heard it, and wanted me to
come; and so is my uncle, I'm sure, now he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)'s heard it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was
gone out to Rosseter all yesterday. They'll look for you there as
soon as you've got time to go, for there's nobody round that hearth
but what's glad to see you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>Dinah, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) sympathetic divination, knew quite well that
Adam was longing to hear if Hetty had said anything about their
trouble; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was too rigorously truthful for benevolent invention,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had contrived to say something in which Hetty was tacitly
included. Love has a way of cheating itself consciously, like a child
who plays at solitary hide-and-seek; it is pleased with assurances
that it all the while disbelieves. Adam liked what Dinah had said so
much that his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mind was directly full of the next visit he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) should pay
to the Hall Farm, when Hetty would perhaps behave more kindly
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>) than she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had ever done before.
<div class="bookquote">``But you won't be there yourself any longer?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>) said to Dinah.
``No, I go back to Snowfield on Saturday, and I shall have to set
out to Treddleston early, to be in time for the Oakbourne carrier.
So I must go back to the farm to-night, that I may have the last day
with my aunt and her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) children. But I can stay here all to-day, if



<p/>156

<p/>your mother would like me; and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart seemed inclined
towards me last night.''
``Ah, then, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s sure to want you to-day. If mother takes to
people at the beginning, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s sure to get fond of ’em; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s a
strange way of not liking young women. Though, to be sure,''
Adam went on, smiling, ``her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) not liking other young women is no
reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shouldn't like you.''
Hitherto Gyp had been assisting at this conversation in
motionless silence, seated on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) haunches, and alternately
looking up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) master's face to watch its expression and
observing Dinah's movements about the kitchen. The kind smile
with which Adam uttered the last words was apparently decisive
with Gyp of the light in which the stranger was to be regarded,
and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) turned round after putting aside her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) sweeping-brush,
he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) trotted towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) and put up his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) muzzle against her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hand in
a friendly way.
``You see Gyp bids you welcome,'' said Adam, ``and he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'s very
slow to welcome strangers.''
``Poor dog!'' said Dinah, patting the rough grey coat, <div class="bookquote">``I've a
strange feeling about the dumb things as if they wanted to speak,
and it was a trouble to ’em because they couldn't. I can't help
being sorry for the dogs always, though perhaps there's no need.
But they may well have more in them than they know how to
make us understand, for we can't say half what we feel, with all
our words.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Seth came down now, and was pleased to find Adam talking
with Dinah; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) wanted Adam to know how much better she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was
than all other women. But after a few words of greeting, Adam
drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) into the workshop to consult about the coffin, and Dinah



<p/>157

<p/>went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) cleaning.
By six o’clock they were all at breakfast with Lisbeth in a
kitchen as clean as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) could have made it herself. The window
and door were open, and the morning air brought with it a
mingled scent of southernwood, thyme, and sweet-briar from the
patch of garden by the side of the cottage. Dinah did not sit down
at first, but moved about, serving the others with the warm
porridge and the toasted oat-cake, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had got ready in the
usual way, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had asked Seth to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) just what his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) mother
gave them for breakfast. Lisbeth had been unusually silent since
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) came downstairs, apparently requiring some time to adjust
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) ideas to a state of things in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) came down like a lady to
find all the work done, and sat still to be waited on. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) new
sensations seemed to exclude the remembrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) grief. At
last, after tasting the porridge, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) broke silence:
<div class="bookquote">``Ye might ha' made the parridge worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) said to Dinah; <div class="bookquote">``I
can ate it wi’out its turnin' my stomach. It might ha' been a trifle
thicker an' no harm, an' I allays putten a sprig o' mint in mysen;
but how's ye t' know that? The lads arena like to get folks as 'll
make their parridge as I’n made it for ’em; it's well if they get
onybody as 'll make parridge at all. But ye might do, wi' a bit o'
showin'; for ye're a stirrin' body in a mornin', an' ye've a light heel,
an' ye've cleaned th' house well enough for a ma'shift.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Makeshift, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam. <div class="bookquote">``Why, I think the house looks
beautiful. I don't know how it could look better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Thee dostna know? Nay; how's thee to know? Th' men ne’er
know whether the floor's cleaned or cat-licked. But thee'lt know
when thee gets thy parridge burnt, as it's like enough to be when
I’n gi’en o’er makin' it. Thee'lt think thy mother war good for



<p/>158

<p/>summat then.''
``Dinah,'' said Seth, ``do come and sit down now and have your
breakfast. We're all served now.''
``Aye, come an' sit ye down--do,'' said Lisbeth, ``an' ate a
morsel; ye'd need, arter bein' upo' your legs this hour an' half
a'ready. Come, then,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) added, in a tone of complaining
affection, as Dinah sat down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) side, ``I'll be loath for ye t' go,
but ye canna stay much longer, I doubt. I could put up wi' ye i' th'
house better nor wi' most folks.''
``I'll stay till to-night if you're willing,'' said Dinah. ``I'd stay
longer, only I'm going back to Snowfield on Saturday, and I must
be with my aunt to-morrow.''
``Eh, I'd ne’er go back to that country. My old man come from
that Stonyshire side, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left it when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) war a young un, an' i'
the right on 't too; for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said as there war no wood there, an' it 'ud
ha' been a bad country for a carpenter.''
``Ah,'' said Adam, <div class="bookquote">``I remember father telling me when I was a
little lad that he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mind if ever he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) moved it should be
south'ard. But I'm not so sure about it. Bartle Massey says--and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) knows the South--as the northern men are a finer breed than
the southern, harder-headed and stronger-bodied, and a deal
taller. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) says in some o' those counties it's as flat as the
back o' your hand, and you can see nothing of a distance without
climbing up the highest trees. I couldn't abide that. I like to go to
work by a road that'll take me up a bit of a hill, and see the fields
for miles round me, and a bridge, or a town, or a bit of a steeple
here and there. It makes you feel the world's a big place, and
there's other men working in it with their heads and hands
besides yourself.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like th' hills best,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Seth, <div class="bookquote">``when the clouds are over your
head and you see the sun shining ever so far off, over the
Loamford way, as I've often done o' late, on the stormy days. It
seems to me as if that was heaven where there's always joy and
sunshine, though this life's dark and cloudy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I love the Stonyshire side,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>said Dinah; <div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't like to
set my face towards the countries where they're rich in corn and
cattle, and the ground so level and easy to tread; and to turn my
back on the hills where the poor people have to live such a hard
life and the men spend their days in the mines away from the
sunlight. It's very blessed on a bleak cold day, when the sky is
hanging dark over the hill, to feel the love of God in one's soul, and
carry it to the lonely, bare, stone houses, where there's nothing
else to give comfort.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Eh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Lisbeth, <div class="bookquote">``that's very well for ye to talk, as looks welly
like the snowdrop-flowers as ha' lived for days an' days when I’n
gethered ’em, wi' nothin' but a drop o' water an' a peep o' daylight;

makes less mouths for the scant cake. But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) went on, looking
at Adam, <div class="bookquote">``donna thee talk o' goin' south'ard or north'ard, an'

 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Donna fear, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam. <div class="bookquote">``If I hadna made up my
mind not to go, I should ha' been gone before now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) breakfast now, and rose as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was speaking.
<div class="bookquote">``What art goin' to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>asked Lisbeth. <div class="bookquote">``Set about thy feyther's
coffin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam; ``we're going to take the wood to the



<p/>160

<p/>village and have it made there.''
``Nay, my lad, nay,'' Lisbeth burst out in an eager, wailing tone;
``thee wotna let nobody make thy feyther's coffin but thysen?
Who'd make it so well? An' him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) as know'd what good work war,
an's got a son as is the head o' the village an' all Treddles'on too,
for cleverness.''
``Very well, mother, if that's thy wish, I'll make the coffin at
home; but I thought thee wouldstna like to hear the work going
on.''
``An' why shouldna I like 't? It's the right thing to be done. An'
what's liking got to do wi't? It's choice o' mislikings is all I’n got i'
this world. One mossel's as good as another when your mouth's
out o' taste. Thee mun set about it now this mornin' fust thing. I
wonna ha' nobody to touch the coffin but thee.''
Adam's eyes met Seth's, which looked from Dinah to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) rather
wistfully.
``No, Mother,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, ``I'll not consent but Seth shall have a
hand in it too, if it's to be done at home. I'll go to the village this
forenoon, because Mr. Burge 'ull want to see me, and Seth shall
stay at home and begin the coffin. I can come back at noon, and
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) can go.''
``Nay, nay,'' persisted Lisbeth, beginning to cry, ``I’n set my
heart on 't as thee shalt ma' thy feyther's coffin. Thee 't so stiff an'
masterful, thee 't ne’er do as thy mother wants thee. Thee wast
often angered wi' thy feyther when he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) war alive; thee must be the
better to him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) now he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)'s gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)'d ha' thought nothin' on 't for
Seth to ma's coffin.''
``Say no more, Adam, say no more,'' said Seth, gently, though
his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) voice told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) spoke with some effort; ``Mother's in the



<p/>161

<p/>right. I'll go to work, and do thee stay at home.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) passed into the workshop immediately, followed by Adam;
while Lisbeth, automatically obeying her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) old habits, began to put
away the breakfast things, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) did not mean Dinah to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
place any longer. Dinah said nothing, but presently used the
opportunity of quietly joining the brothers in the workshop.
They had already got on their aprons and paper caps, and
Adam was standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) left hand on Seth's shoulder, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)
pointed with the hammer in his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) right to some boards which they
were looking at. Their backs were turned towards the door by
which Dinah entered, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) came in so gently that they were not
aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) presence till they heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) voice saying, ``Seth
Bede!'' Seth started, and they both turned round. Dinah looked as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) did not see Adam, and fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) eyes on Seth's face, saying
with calm kindness, ``I won't say farewell. I shall see you again
when you come from work. So as I'm at the farm before dark, it
will be quite soon enough.''
``Thank you, Dinah; I should like to walk home with you once
more. It'll perhaps be the last time.''
There was a little tremor in Seth's voice. Dinah put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
hand and said, ``You'll have sweet peace in your mind to-day, Seth,
for your tenderness and long-suffering towards your aged
mother.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) turned round and left the workshop as quickly and quietly
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had entered it. Adam had been observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) closely all the
while, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had not looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``I don't wonder at thee for loving her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), Seth. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s got a face
like a lily.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Seth's soul rushed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) eyes and lips: he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had never yet



<p/>162

<p/>confessed his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) secret to Adam, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) felt a delicious sense of
disburthenment, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) answered,
<div class="bookquote">``Aye, Addy, I do love her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--too much, I doubt. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) doesna
love me, lad, only as one child o' God loves another. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'ll never
love any man as a husband--that's my belief.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nay, lad, there's no telling; thee mustna lose heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s made
out o' stuff with a finer grain than most o' the women; I can see
that clear enough. But if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s better than they are in other things,
I canna think she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'ll fall short of ’em in loving.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No more was said. Seth set out to the village, and Adam began
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) work on the coffin.
<div class="bookquote">``God help the lad, and me too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) lifted the
board. <div class="bookquote">``We're like enough to find life a tough job--hard work
inside and out. It's a strange thing to think of a man as can lift a
chair with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth and walk fifty mile on end, trembling and
turning hot and cold at only a look from one woman out of all the
rest i' the world. It's a mystery we can give no account of; but no
more we can of the sprouting o' the seed, for that matter.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Wood</b></font>)</div><p/>163

<p/>Chapter XII
In the Wood

<p/>T

<p/>hat same Thursday morning, as Arthur Donnithorne was
moving about in his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) dressing-room seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) well-looking
British person reflected in the old-fashioned mirrors, and
stared at, from a dingy olive-green piece of tapestry, by Pharaoh's
daughter and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) maidens, who ought to have been minding the
infant Moses, he (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) was holding a discussion with himself, which, by
the time his (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) valet was tying the black silk sling over his (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) shoulder,
had issued in a distinct practical resolution.
<div class="bookquote">``I mean to go to Eagledale and fish for a week or so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) said
aloud. <div class="bookquote">``I shall take you with me, Pym, and set off this morning; so
be ready by half-past eleven.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The low whistle, which had assisted him (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) in arriving at this
resolution, here broke out into his (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) loudest ringing tenor, and the
corridor, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) hurried along it, echoed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) favourite song from
the Beggar's Opera, <div class="bookquote">``When the heart of a man is oppressed with
care.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Beggar</b></font>)</div>Not an heroic strain; nevertheless Arthur felt himself very
heroic as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) strode towards the stables to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) orders about the
horses. His (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own approbation was necessary to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and it was not
an approbation to be enjoyed quite gratuitously; it must be won by
a fair amount of merit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had never yet forfeited that
approbation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had considerable reliance on his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own virtues.
No young man could confess his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) faults more candidly; candour
was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) favourite virtues; and how can a man's candour be
seen in all its lustre unless he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a few failings to talk of? But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)




<p/>164

<p/>had an agreeable confidence that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) faults were all of a generous
kind--impetuous, warm-blooded, leonine; never crawling, crafty,
reptilian. It was not possible for Arthur Donnithorne to do
anything mean, dastardly, or cruel. <div class="bookquote">``No! I'm a devil of a fellow for
getting myself into a hobble, but I always take care the load shall
fall on my own shoulders.''  (<font color='red'><b>the offender</b></font>)</div>Unhappily, there is no inherent
poetical justice in hobbles, and they will sometimes obstinately
refuse to inflict their worst consequences on the prime offender, in
spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>offender</b></font>) loudly expressed wish. It was entirely owing to this
deficiency in the scheme of things that Arthur had ever brought
any one into trouble besides himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was nothing if not goodnatured; and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) pictures of the future, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) should come
into the estate, were made up of a prosperous, contented tenantry,
adoring their landlord, who would be the model of an English
gentleman--mansion in first-rate order, all elegance and high
taste--jolly housekeeping, finest stud in Loamshire--purse open
to all public objects--in short, everything as different as possible
from what was now associated with the name of Donnithorne. And
one of the first good actions he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) would perform in that future
should be to increase Irwine's income for the vicarage of Hayslope,
so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) might keep a carriage for his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) mother and sisters. His (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
hearty affection for the rector dated from the age of frocks and
trousers. It was an affection partly filial, partly fraternal--fraternal
enough to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) like Irwine's company better than that of
most younger men, and filial enough to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) shrink strongly
from incurring Irwine's disapprobation.
You perceive that Arthur Donnithorne was <div class="bookquote">``a good fellow'' (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>--all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) college friends thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) such. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) couldn't bear to see any
one uncomfortable; he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) would have been sorry even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) angriest



<p/>165

<p/>moods for any harm to happen to his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) grandfather; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) Aunt
Lydia herself had the benefit of that soft-heartedness which he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>)
bore towards the whole sex. Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) would have self-mastery
enough to be always as harmless and purely beneficent as his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>)
good-nature led him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) to desire, was a question that no one had yet
decided against him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) was but twenty-one, you remember, and
we don't inquire too closely into character in the case of a
handsome generous young fellow, who will have property enough
to support numerous peccadilloes--who, if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) should
unfortunately break a man's legs in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) rash driving, will be able to
pension him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) handsomely; or if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) should happen to spoil a
woman's existence for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), will make it up to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with expensive
bon-bons, packed up and directed by his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own hand. It would be
ridiculous to be prying and analytic in such cases, as if one were
inquiring into the character of a confidential clerk. We use round,
general, gentlemanly epithets about a young man of birth and
fortune; and ladies, with that fine intuition which is the
distinguishing attribute of their sex, see at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is <div class="bookquote">``nice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The chances are that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will go through life without scandalising
any one; a seaworthy vessel that no one would refuse to insure.
Ships, certainly, are liable to casualties, which sometimes make
terribly evident some flaw in their construction that would never
have been discoverable in smooth water; and many a <div class="bookquote">``good
fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>through a disastrous combination of circumstances, has
undergone a like betrayal.
But we have no fair ground for entertaining unfavourable
auguries concerning Arthur Donnithorne, who this morning
proves himself capable of a prudent resolution founded on
conscience. One thing is clear: Nature has taken care that he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) shall



<p/>166

<p/>never go far astray with perfect comfort and satisfaction to
himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) will never get beyond that borderland of sin, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>)
will be perpetually harassed by assaults from the other side of the
boundary. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) will never be a courtier of Vice, and wear her (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) orders
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) button-hole.
It was about ten o’clock, and the sun was shining brilliantly;
everything was looking lovelier for the yesterday's rain. It is a
pleasant thing on such a morning to walk along the well-rolled
gravel on one's way to the stables, meditating an excursion. But
the scent of the stables, which, in a natural state of things, ought to
be among the soothing influences of a man's life, always brought
with it some irritation to Arthur. There was no having his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own way
in the stables; everything was managed in the stingiest fashion.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) grandfather persisted in retaining as head groom an old dolt
whom no sort of lever could move out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) old habits, and who
was allowed to hire a succession of raw Loamshire lads as his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
subordinates, one of whom had lately tested a new pair of shears
by clipping an oblong patch on Arthur's bay mare. This state of
things is naturally embittering; one can put up with annoyances in
the house, but to have the stable made a scene of vexation and
disgust is a point beyond what human flesh and blood can be
expected to endure long together without danger of misanthropy.
Old John's wooden, deep-wrinkled face was the first object that
met Arthur's eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) entered the stable-yard, and it quite
poisoned for him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) the bark of the two bloodhounds that kept watch
there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could never speak quite patiently to the old blockhead.
<div class="bookquote">``You must have Meg saddled for me and brought to the door at
half-past eleven, and I shall want Rattler saddled for Pym at the
same time. Do you hear?''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>167

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I hear, I hear, Cap’n,''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>said old John very deliberately,
following the young master into the stable. John considered a
young master as the natural enemy of an old servant, and young
people in general as a poor contrivance for carrying on the world.
Arthur went in for the sake of patting Meg, declining as far as
possible to see anything in the stables, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) should lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
temper before breakfast. The pretty creature was in one of the
inner stables, and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mild head as her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) master came beside
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>). Little Trot, a tiny spaniel, her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) inseparable companion in the
stable, was comfortably curled up on her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) back.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, Meg, my pretty girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>said Arthur, patting her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) neck, <div class="bookquote">``we'll
have a glorious canter this morning.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nay, your honour, I donna see as that can be,''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>said John.
<div class="bookquote">``Not be? Why not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)'s got lamed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Lamed, confound you! What do you mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, th' lad took her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) too close to Dalton's hosses, an' one on
’em flung out at her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)'s got her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) shank bruised o' the near
foreleg.''
 (<font color='red'><b>historian</b></font>)</div>The judicious historian abstains from narrating precisely what
ensued. You understand that there was a great deal of strong
language, mingled with soothing <div class="bookquote">``who-ho's''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>while the leg was
examined; that John stood by with quite as much emotion as if he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
had been a cunningly carved crab-tree walking-stick, and that
Arthur Donnithorne presently repassed the iron gates of the
pleasure-ground without singing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) went.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) considered himself thoroughly disappointed and annoyed.
There was not another mount in the stable for himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>)
servant besides Meg and Rattler. It was vexatious; just when he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>)



<p/>168

<p/>wanted to get out of the way for a week or two. It seemed culpable
in Providence to allow such a combination of circumstances. To be
shut up at the Chase with a broken arm when every other fellow in
his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) regiment was enjoying himself at Windsor--shut up with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
grandfather, who had the same sort of affection for him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) as for his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
parchment deeds! And to be disgusted at every turn with the
management of the house and the estate! In such circumstances a
man necessarily gets in an ill humour, and works off the irritation
by some excess or other. <div class="bookquote">``Salkeld would have drunk a bottle of
port every day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) muttered to himself, <div class="bookquote">``but I'm not well
seasoned enough for that. Well, since I can't go to Eagledale, I'll
have a gallop on Rattler to Norburne this morning, and lunch with
Gawaine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Behind this explicit resolution there lay an implicit one. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
lunched with Gawaine and lingered chatting, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should not reach
the Chase again till nearly five, when Hetty would be safe out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sight in the housekeeper's room; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) set out to go
home, it would be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lazy time after dinner, so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should keep out
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) way altogether. There really would have been no harm in
being kind to the little thing, and it was worth dancing with a
dozen ballroom belles only to look at Hetty for half an hour. But
perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had better not take any more notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>); it might
put notions into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) head, as Irwine had hinted; though Arthur, for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) part, thought girls were not by any means so soft and easily
bruised; indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had generally found them twice as cool and
cunning as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was himself. As for any real harm in Hetty's case, it
was out of the question: Arthur Donnithorne accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) own
bond for himself with perfect confidence.
So the twelve o’clock sun saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) galloping towards Norburne;



<p/>169

<p/>and by good fortune Halsell Common lay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) road and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>)
some fine leaps for Rattler. Nothing like <div class="bookquote">``taking''  (<font color='red'><b>a demon</b></font>)</div>a few bushes and
ditches for exorcising a demon; and it is really astonishing that the
Centaurs, with their immense advantages in this way, have left so
bad a reputation in history.
After this, you will perhaps be surprised to hear that although
Gawaine was at home, the hand of the dial in the courtyard had
scarcely cleared the last stroke of three when Arthur returned
through the entrance-gates, got down from the panting Rattler,
and went into the house to take a hasty luncheon. But I believe
there have been men since his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) day who have ridden a long way to
avoid a rencontre, and then galloped hastily back lest they should
miss it. It is the favourite stratagem of our passions to sham a
retreat, and to turn sharp round upon us at the moment we have
made up our minds that the day is our own.
<div class="bookquote">``The cap’n's been ridin' the devil's own pace,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dalton</b></font>)</div>said Dalton the
coachman, whose person stood out in high relief as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dalton</b></font>) smoked his (<font color='blue'><b>Dalton</b></font>)
pipe against the stable wall, when John brought up Rattler.
<div class="bookquote">``An' I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)'d get the devil to do's grooming for’n,''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>growled
John.
<div class="bookquote">``Aye; he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)'d hev a deal hamabler groom nor what he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) has now,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dalton</b></font>)</div>observed Dalton--and the joke appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) so good that,
being left alone upon the scene, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) continued at intervals to take
his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) pipe from his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mouth in order to wink at an imaginary audience
and shake luxuriously with a silent, ventral laughter, mentally
rehearsing the dialogue from the beginning, that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) might recite it
with effect in the servants' hall.
When Arthur went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) dressing-room again after
luncheon, it was inevitable that the debate he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had had with



<p/>170

<p/>himself there earlier in the day should flash across his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mind; but it
was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) now to dwell on the remembrance--
impossible to recall the feelings and reflections which had been
decisive with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) then, any more than to recall the peculiar scent
of the air that had freshened him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) first opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
window. The desire to see Hetty had rushed back like an illstemmed current; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was amazed himself at the force with which
this trivial fancy seemed to grasp him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was even rather
tremulous as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) brushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hair--pooh! it was riding in that
break-neck way. It was because he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had made a serious affair of an
idle matter, by thinking of it as if it were of any consequence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
would amuse himself by seeing Hetty to-day, and get rid of the
whole thing from his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mind. It was all Irwine's fault. <div class="bookquote">``If Irwine had
said nothing, I shouldn't have thought half so much of Hetty as of
Meg's lameness.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>However, it was just the sort of day for lolling in
the Hermitage, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would go and finish Dr. Moore's Zeluco
there before dinner. The Hermitage stood in Fir-tree Grove--the
way Hetty was sure to come in walking from the Hall Farm. So
nothing could be simpler and more natural: meeting Hetty was a
mere circumstance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) walk, not its object.
Arthur's shadow flitted rather faster among the sturdy oaks of
the Chase than might have been expected from the shadow of a
tired man on a warm afternoon, and it was still scarcely four
o’clock when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood before the tall narrow gate leading into the
delicious labyrinthine wood which skirted one side of the Chase,
and which was called Fir-tree Grove, not because the firs were
many, but because they were few. It was a wood of beeches and
limes, with here and there a light silver-stemmed birch--just the
sort of wood most haunted by the nymphs: you see their white



<p/>171

<p/>sunlit limbs gleaming athwart the boughs, or peeping from behind
the smooth-sweeping outline of a tall lime; you hear their soft
liquid laughter--but if you look with a too curious sacrilegious eye,
they vanish behind the silvery beeches, they make you believe that
their voice was only a running brooklet, perhaps they
metamorphose themselves into a tawny squirrel that scampers
away and mocks you from the topmost bough. It was not a grove
with measured grass or rolled gravel for you to tread upon, but
with narrow, hollow-shaped, earthy paths, edged with faint dashes
of delicate moss--paths which look as if they were made by the
free will of the trees and underwood, moving reverently aside to
look at the tall queen of the white-footed nymphs.
It was along the broadest of these paths that Arthur
Donnithorne passed, under an avenue of limes and beeches. It was
a still afternoon--the golden light was lingering languidly among
the upper boughs, only glancing down here and there on the
purple pathway and its edge of faintly sprinkled moss: an
afternoon in which destiny disguises her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) cold awful face behind a
hazy radiant veil, encloses us in warm downy wings, and poisons
us with violet-scented breath. Arthur strolled along carelessly,
with a book under his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) arm, but not looking on the ground as
meditative men are apt to do; his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) eyes would fix themselves on the
distant bend in the road round which a little figure must surely
appear before long. Ah! There she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) comes. First a bright patch of
colour, like a tropic bird among the boughs; then a tripping figure,
with a round hat on, and a small basket under her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) arm; then a
deep-blushing, almost frightened, but bright-smiling girl, making
her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) curtsy with a fluttered yet happy glance, as Arthur came up to
her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>). If Arthur had had time to think at all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would have thought



<p/>172

<p/>it strange that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) should feel fluttered too, be conscious of
blushing too--in fact, look and feel as foolish as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had been
taken by surprise instead of meeting just what he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) expected. Poor
things! It was a pity they were not in that golden age of childhood
when they would have stood face to face, eyeing each other with
timid liking, then given each other a little butterfly kiss, and
toddled off to play together. Arthur would have gone home to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
silk-curtained cot, and Hetty to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) home-spun pillow, and both
would have slept without dreams, and to-morrow would have been
a life hardly conscious of a yesterday.
Arthur turned round and walked by Hetty's side without giving
a reason. They were alone together for the first time. What an
overpowering presence that first privacy is! He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) actually dared not
look at this little butter-maker for the first minute or two. As for
Hetty, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) feet rested on a cloud, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was borne along by
warm zephyrs; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) rose-coloured ribbons; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
was no more conscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) limbs than if her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) childish soul had
passed into a water-lily, resting on a liquid bed and warmed by the
midsummer sun-beams. It may seem a contradiction, but Arthur
gathered a certain carelessness and confidence from his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) timidity:
it was an entirely different state of mind from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had
expected in such a meeting with Hetty; and full as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was of vague
feeling, there was room, in those moments of silence, for the
thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) previous debates and scruples were needless.
<div class="bookquote">``You are quite right to choose this way of coming to the Chase,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said at last, looking down at Hetty; <div class="bookquote">``it is so much prettier as
well as shorter than coming by either of the lodges.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>Hetty answered, with a tremulous, almost
whispering voice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) didn't know one bit how to speak to a



<p/>173

<p/>gentleman like Mr. Arthur, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) very vanity made her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) more coy
of speech.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you come every week to see Mrs. Pomfret?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, every Thursday, only when she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>)'s got to go out with
Miss Donnithorne.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>)'s teaching you something, is she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, the lace-mending as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>) learnt abroad, and the
stocking-mending--it looks just like the stocking, you can't tell it's
been mended; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>) teaches me cutting-out too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What! are you going to be a lady's maid?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I should like to be one very much indeed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>Hetty spoke more
audibly now, but still rather tremulously; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thought, perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
seemed as stupid to Captain Donnithorne as Luke Britton did to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I suppose Mrs. Pomfret always expects you at this time?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>) expects me at four o’clock. I'm rather late to-day, because
my aunt couldn't spare me; but the regular time is four, because
that gives us time before Miss Donnithorne's bell rings.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, then, I must not keep you now, else I should like to show
you the Hermitage. Did you ever see it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This is the walk where we turn up to it. But we must not go
now. I'll show it you some other time, if you'd like to see it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, please, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you always come back this way in the evening, or are you
afraid to come so lonely a road?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, sir, it's never late; I always set out by eight o’clock, and
it's so light now in the evening. My aunt would be angry with me if
I didn't get home before nine.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>174

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps Craig, the gardener, comes to take care of you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>A deep blush overspread Hetty's face and neck. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>)
doesn't; I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) never did; I wouldn't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>); I don't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said hastily, and the tears of vexation had come so fast that
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had done speaking a bright drop rolled down her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hot
cheek. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt ashamed to death that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was crying, and for
one long instant her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) happiness was all gone. But in the next she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
felt an arm steal round her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), and a gentle voice said, <div class="bookquote">``Why, Hetty,
what makes you cry? I didn't mean to vex you. I wouldn't vex you
for the world, you little blossom. Come, don't cry; look at me, else I
shall think you won't forgive me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Arthur had laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hand on the soft arm that was nearest to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and was stooping towards Hetty with a look of coaxing
entreaty. Hetty lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) long dewy lashes, and met the eyes that
were bent towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) with a sweet, timid, beseeching look. What
a space of time those three moments were while their eyes met
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) arms touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)! Love is such a simple thing when we
have only one-and-twenty summers and a sweet girl of seventeen
trembles under our glance, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were a bud first opening her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
heart with wondering rapture to the morning. Such young
unfurrowed souls roll to meet each other like two velvet peaches
that touch softly and are at rest; they mingle as easily as two
brooklets that ask for nothing but to entwine themselves and
ripple with ever-interlacing curves in the leafiest hiding-places.
While Arthur gazed into Hetty's dark beseeching eyes, it made no
difference to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) what sort of English she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) spoke; and even if hoops
and powder had been in fashion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would very likely not have
been sensible just then that Hetty wanted those signs of high
breeding.



<p/>175

<p/>But they started asunder with beating hearts: something had
fallen on the ground with a rattling noise; it was Hetty's basket; all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) little workwoman's matters were scattered on the path, some
of them showing a capability of rolling to great lengths. There was
much to be done in picking up, and not a word was spoken; but
when Arthur hung the basket over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) arm again, the poor child
felt a strange difference in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) look and manner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) just pressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hand, and said, with a look and tone that were almost chilling
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I have been hindering you; I must not keep you any longer
now. You will be expected at the house. Good-bye.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Without waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to speak, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) turned away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and
hurried back towards the road that led to the Hermitage, leaving
Hetty to pursue her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) way in a strange dream that seemed to have
begun in bewildering delight and was now passing into
contrarieties and sadness. Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) again as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) came
home? Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) spoken almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) were displeased with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)? And then run away so suddenly? She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cried, hardly knowing
why.
Arthur too was very uneasy, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) feelings were lit up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
by a more distinct consciousness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hurried to the Hermitage,
which stood in the heart of the wood, unlocked the door with a
hasty wrench, slammed it after him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), pitched Zeluco into the most
distant corner, and thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) right hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) pocket, first
walked four or five times up and down the scanty length of the
little room, and then seated himself on the ottoman in an
uncomfortable stiff way, as we often do when we wish not to
abandon ourselves to feeling.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was getting in love with Hetty--that was quite plain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was
ready to pitch everything else--no matter where--for the sake of



<p/>176

<p/>surrendering himself to this delicious feeling which had just
disclosed itself. It was no use blinking the fact now--they would
get too fond of each other, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) went on taking notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)--and
what would come of it? He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) should have to go away in a few weeks,
and the poor little thing would be miserable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) must not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
alone again; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) must keep out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) way. What a fool he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was for
coming back from Gawaine's!
He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) got up and threw open the windows, to let in the soft breath
of the afternoon, and the healthy scent of the firs that made a belt
round the Hermitage. The soft air did not help his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) resolution, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
leaned out and looked into the leafy distance. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) considered
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) resolution sufficiently fixed: there was no need to debate with
himself any longer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mind not to meet Hetty
again; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) might give himself up to thinking how
immensely agreeable it would be if circumstances were different--
how pleasant it would have been to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) this evening as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
came back, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) again and look into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
sweet face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) wondered if the dear little thing were thinking of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) too--twenty to one she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was. How beautiful her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eyes were with
the tear on their lashes! He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would like to satisfy his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) soul for a day
with looking at them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) must see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) again--he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) must see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>),
simply to remove any false impression from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mind about his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
manner to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) just now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would behave in a quiet, kind way to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)--just to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) from going home with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) head full of
wrong fancies. Yes, that would be the best thing to do after all.
It was a long while--more than an hour before Arthur had
brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) meditations to this point; but once arrived there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
could stay no longer at the Hermitage. The time must be filled up
with movement until he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) should see Hetty again. And it was



<p/>177

<p/>already late enough to go and dress for dinner, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
grandfather's dinner-hour was six.




<p/>178

<p/>Chapter XIII
Evening in the Wood

<p/>I

<p/>t happened that Mrs. Pomfret had had a slight quarrel with
Mrs. Best, the housekeeper, on this Thursday morning--a fact
which had two consequences highly convenient to Hetty. It
caused Mrs. Pomfret to have tea sent up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>) own room, and it
inspired that exemplary lady's maid with so lively a recollection of
former passages in Mrs. Best's conduct, and of dialogues in which
Mrs. Best had decidedly the inferiority as an interlocutor with
Mrs. Pomfret, that Hetty required no more presence of mind than
was demanded for using her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) needle, and throwing in an occasional
<div class="bookquote">``yes''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``no.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would have wanted to put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hat earlier
than usual; only she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had told Captain Donnithorne that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
usually set out about eight o’clock, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) should go to the Grove
again expecting to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) should be gone! Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
come? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) little butterfly soul fluttered incessantly between
memory and dubious expectation. At last the minute-hand of the
old-fashioned brazen-faced timepiece was on the last quarter to
eight, and there was every reason for its being time to get ready
for departure. Even Mrs. Pomfret's preoccupied mind did not
prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>) from noticing what looked like a new flush of beauty
in the little thing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>) tied on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>) hat before the looking-glass.
<div class="bookquote">``That child gets prettier and prettier every day, I do believe,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>) inward comment. <div class="bookquote">``The more's the pity. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll get neither
a place nor a husband any the sooner for it. Sober well-to-do men
don't like such pretty wives. When I was a girl, I was more




<p/>179

<p/>admired than if I had been so very pretty. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s reason
to be grateful to me for teaching her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) something to get her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bread
with, better than farm-house work. They always told me I was
good-natured--and that's the truth, and to my hurt too, else
there's them in this house that wouldn't be here now to lord it over
me in the housekeeper's room.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hetty walked hastily across the short space of pleasure-ground
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had to traverse, dreading to meet Mr. Craig, to whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could hardly have spoken civilly. How relieved she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had got safely under the oaks and among the fern of the
Chase! Even then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was as ready to be startled as the deer that
leaped away at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) approach. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thought nothing of the evening
light that lay gently in the grassy alleys between the fern, and
made the beauty of their living green more visible than it had been
in the overpowering flood of noon: she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thought of nothing that was
present. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) only saw something that was possible: Mr. Arthur
Donnithorne coming to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) again along the Fir-tree Grove.
That was the foreground of Hetty's picture; behind it lay a bright
hazy something--days that were not to be as the other days of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
life had been. It was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had been wooed by a river-god, who
might any time take her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) wondrous halls below a watery
heaven. There was no knowing what would come, since this
strange entrancing delight had come. If a chest full of lace and
satin and jewels had been sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) from some unknown source,
how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) but have thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) whole lot was going to
change, and that to-morrow some still more bewildering joy would
befall her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)? Hetty had never read a novel; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had ever seen one,
I think the words would have been too hard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>); how then
could she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) find a shape for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) expectations? They were as



<p/>180

<p/>formless as the sweet languid odours of the garden at the Chase,
which had floated past her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) walked by the gate.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) is at another gate now--that leading into Fir-tree Grove.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) enters the wood, where it is already twilight, and at every step
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) takes, the fear at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heart becomes colder. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) should not
come! Oh, how dreary it was--the thought of going out at the
other end of the wood, into the unsheltered road, without having
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) reaches the first turning towards the Hermitage,
walking slowly--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) is not there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hates the leveret that runs
across the path; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hates everything that is not what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) longs
for. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) walks on, happy whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) is coming to a bend in the
road, for perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) is behind it. No. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) is beginning to cry: her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
heart has swelled so, the tears stand in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eyes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) gives one
great sob, while the corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mouth quiver, and the tears roll
down.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) doesn't know that there is another turning to the
Hermitage, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) is close against it, and that Arthur
Donnithorne is only a few yards from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), full of one thought, and
a thought of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) only is the object. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) is going to see Hetty
again: that is the longing which has been growing through the last
three hours to a feverish thirst. Not, of course, to speak in the
caressing way into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) had unguardedly fallen before dinner,
but to set things right with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) by a kindness which would have
the air of friendly civility, and prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) from running away with
wrong notions about their mutual relation.
If Hetty had known he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) was there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would not have cried; and
it would have been better, for then Arthur would perhaps have
behaved as wisely as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had intended. As it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) started when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) appeared at the end of the side-alley, and looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) with



<p/>181

<p/>two great drops rolling down her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cheeks. What else could he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) do
but speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) in a soft, soothing tone, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) were a brighteyed spaniel with a thorn in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) foot?
<div class="bookquote">``Has something frightened you, Hetty? Have you seen anything
in the wood? Don't be frightened--I'll take care of you now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>Hetty was blushing so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) didn't know whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was happy
or miserable. To be crying again--what did gentlemen think of
girls who cried in that way? She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt unable even to say <div class="bookquote">``no,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>but
could only look away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) and wipe the tears from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cheek.
Not before a great drop had fallen on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) rose-coloured strings--
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knew that quite well.
<div class="bookquote">``Come, be cheerful again. Smile at me, and tell me what's the
matter. Come, tell me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>Hetty turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) head towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), whispered, <div class="bookquote">``I thought you
wouldn't come,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and slowly got courage to lift her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eyes to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).
That look was too much: he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) must have had eyes of Egyptian
granite not to look too lovingly in return.
<div class="bookquote">``You little frightened bird! Little tearful rose! Silly pet! You
won't cry again, now I'm with you, will you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Ah, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) doesn't know in the least what he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is saying. This is not
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) meant to say. His (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) arm is stealing round the waist again; it
is tightening its clasp; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is bending his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) face nearer and nearer to
the round cheek; his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) lips are meeting those pouting child-lips, and
for a long moment time has vanished. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) may be a shepherd in
Arcadia for aught he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knows, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) may be the first youth kissing the
first maiden, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) may be Eros himself, sipping the lips of Psyche--it
is all one.
There was no speaking for minutes after. They walked along
with beating hearts till they came within sight of the gate at the



<p/>182

<p/>end of the wood. Then they looked at each other, not quite as they
had looked before, for in their eyes there was the memory of a kiss.
But already something bitter had begun to mingle itself with
the fountain of sweets: already Arthur was uncomfortable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) took
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) arm from Hetty's waist, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Here we are, almost at the
end of the Grove. I wonder how late it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) added, pulling out
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``Twenty minutes past eight--but my watch is too fast.
However, I'd better not go any further now. Trot along quickly
with your little feet, and get home safely. Good-bye.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hand, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) half-sadly, half with a
constrained smile. Hetty's eyes seemed to beseech him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) not to go
away yet; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) patted her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cheek and said <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
was obliged to turn away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) and go on.
As for Arthur, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) rushed back through the wood, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
wanted to put a wide space between himself and Hetty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would
not go to the Hermitage again; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) remembered how he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had
debated with himself there before dinner, and it had all come to
nothing--worse than nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) walked right on into the Chase,
glad to get out of the Grove, which surely was haunted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) evil
genius. Those beeches and smooth limes--there was something
enervating in the very sight of them; but the strong knotted old
oaks had no bending languor in them--the sight of them would
give a man some energy. Arthur lost himself among the narrow
openings in the fern, winding about without seeking any issue, till
the twilight deepened almost to night under the great boughs, and
the hare looked black as it darted across his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) path.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was feeling much more strongly than he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had done in the
morning: it was as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) horse had wheeled round from a leap and
dared to dispute his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mastery. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was dissatisfied with himself,



<p/>183

<p/>irritated, mortified. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) no sooner fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mind on the probable
consequences of giving way to the emotions which had stolen over
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to-day--of continuing to notice Hetty, of allowing himself any
opportunity for such slight caresses as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had been betrayed into
already--than he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) refused to believe such a future possible for
himself. To flirt with Hetty was a very different affair from flirting
with a pretty girl of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own station: that was understood to be an
amusement on both sides, or, if it became serious, there was no
obstacle to marriage. But this little thing would be spoken ill of
directly, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) happened to be seen walking with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>); and then
those excellent people, the Poysers, to whom a good name was as
precious as if they had the best blood in the land in their veins--he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
should hate himself if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) made a scandal of that sort, on the estate
that was to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own some day, and among tenants by whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
liked, above all, to be respected. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could no more believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
should so fall in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own esteem than that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) should break both his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
legs and go on crutches all the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) couldn't imagine
himself in that position; it was too odious, too unlike him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).
And even if no one knew anything about it, they might get too
fond of each other, and then there could be nothing but the misery
of parting, after all. No gentleman, out of a ballad, could marry a
farmer's niece. There must be an end to the whole thing at once. It
was too foolish.
And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had been so determined this morning, before he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)
went to Gawaine's; and while he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) was there something had taken
hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) and made him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) gallop back. It seemed he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) couldn't quite
depend on his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) own resolution, as he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had thought he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) could; he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)
almost wished his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) arm would get painful again, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) should
think of nothing but the comfort it would be to get rid of the pain.



<p/>184

<p/>There was no knowing what impulse might seize him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) to-morrow,
in this confounded place, where there was nothing to occupy him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)
imperiously through the livelong day. What could he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) do to secure
himself from any more of this folly?
There was but one resource. He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) would go and tell Irwine--tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) everything. The mere act of telling it would make it seem
trivial; the temptation would vanish, as the charm of fond words
vanishes when one repeats them to the indifferent. In every way it
would help him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) to tell Irwine. He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) would ride to Broxton Rectory
the first thing after breakfast to-morrow.
Arthur had no sooner come to this determination than he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) began
to think which of the paths would lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) home, and made as
short a walk thither as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) felt sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) should sleep now:
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had had enough to tire him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and there was no more need for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to think.




<p/>185

<p/>Chapter XIV
The Return Home

<p/>W

<p/>hile that parting in the wood was happening, there was
a parting in the cottage too, and Lisbeth had stood with
Adam at the door, straining her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) aged eyes to get the last
glimpse of Seth and Dinah, as they mounted the opposite slope.
<div class="bookquote">``Eh, I'm loath to see the last on her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) said to Adam, as they
turned into the house again. <div class="bookquote">``I'd ha' been willin' t' ha' her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) about
me till I died and went to lie by my old man. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'d make it easier
dyin'--she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) spakes so gentle an' moves about so still. I could be fast
sure that pictur' was drawed for her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) i' thy new Bible--th' angel asittin' on the big stone by the grave. Eh, I wouldna mind ha’in a
daughter like that; but nobody ne’er marries them as is good for
aught.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mother, I hope thee wilt have her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) for a daughter; for
Seth's got a liking for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>), and I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'ll get a liking for Seth in
time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where's th' use o' talkin' a-that’n? She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) caresna for Seth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s
goin' away twenty mile aff. How's she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) to get a likin' for him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>), I'd
like to know? No more nor the cake 'ull come wi’out the leaven.
Thy figurin' books might ha' tould thee better nor that, I should
think, else thee mightst as well read the commin print, as Seth
allays does.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, laughing, ``the figures tell us a fine
deal, and we couldn't go far without ’em, but they don't tell us
about folks's feelings. It's a nicer job to calculate them. But Seth's




<p/>186

<p/>as good-hearted a lad as ever handled a tool, and plenty o' sense,
and good-looking too; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)'s got the same way o' thinking as
Dinah. He (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) deserves to win her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), though there's no denying she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s a
rare bit o' workmanship. You don't see such women turned off the
wheel every day.''
``Eh, thee 't allays stick up for thy brother. Thee'st been just the
same, e'er sin' ye war little uns together. Thee wart allays for
halving iverything wi' him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). But what's Seth got to do with
marryin', as is on'y three-an'-twenty? He (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)'d more need to learn an'
lay by sixpence. An' as for his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) desarving her (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s two 'ear older
nor Seth: she (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s pretty near as old as thee. But that's the way; folks
mun allays choose by contrairies, as if they must be sorted like the
pork--a bit o' good meat wi' a bit o' offal.''
To the feminine mind in some of its moods, all things that might
be receive a temporary charm from comparison with what is; and
since Adam did not want to marry Dinah himself, Lisbeth felt
rather peevish on that score--as peevish as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would have been if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had wanted to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), and so shut himself out from Mary
Burge and the partnership as effectually as by marrying Hetty.
It was more than half-past eight when Adam and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother
were talking in this way, so that when, about ten minutes later,
Hetty reached the turning of the lane that led to the farmyard
gate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) saw Dinah and Seth approaching it from the opposite
direction, and waited for them to come up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). They, too, like
Hetty, had lingered a little in their walk, for Dinah was trying to
speak words of comfort and strength to Seth in these parting
moments. But when they saw Hetty, they paused and shook
hands; Seth turned homewards, and Dinah came on alone.
<div class="bookquote">``Seth Bede would have come and spoken to you, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)



<p/>187

<p/>said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) reached Hetty, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>)'s very full of trouble to-night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>Hetty answered with a dimpled smile, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) did not quite
know what had been said; and it made a strange contrast to see
that sparkling self-engrossed loveliness looked at by Dinah's calm
pitying face, with its open glance which told that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) heart lived in
no cherished secrets of its own, but in feelings which it longed to
share with all the world. Hetty liked Dinah as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had ever
liked any woman; how was it possible to feel otherwise towards
one who always put in a kind word for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) when her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt was
finding fault, and who was always ready to take Totty off her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
hands--little tiresome Totty, that was made such a pet of by every
one, and that Hetty could see no interest in at all? Dinah had
never said anything disapproving or reproachful to Hetty during
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) whole visit to the Hall Farm; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) a great deal
in a serious way, but Hetty didn't mind that much, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) never
listened: whatever Dinah might say, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) almost always stroked
Hetty's cheek after it, and wanted to do some mending for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>).
Dinah was a riddle to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>); Hetty looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) much in the same
way as one might imagine a little perching bird that could only
flutter from bough to bough, to look at the swoop of the swallow or
the mounting of the lark; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) did not care to solve such riddles,
any more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cared to know what was meant by the pictures
in the Pilgrim's Progress, or in the old folio Bible that Marty and
Tommy always plagued her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) about on a Sunday.
Dinah took her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hand now and drew it under her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) own arm.
<div class="bookquote">``You look very happy to-night, dear child,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) said. ``I shall
think of you often when I'm at Snowfield, and see your face before
me as it is now. It's a strange thing--sometimes when I'm quite
alone, sitting in my room with my eyes closed, or walking over the



<p/>188

<p/>hills, the people I've seen and known, if it's only been for a few
days, are brought before me, and I hear their voices and see them
look and move almost plainer than I ever did when they were
really with me so as I could touch them. And then my heart is
drawn out towards them, and I feel their lot as if it was my own,
and I take comfort in spreading it before the Lord and resting in
His (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) love, on their behalf as well as my own. And so I feel sure you
will come before me.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) paused a moment, but Hetty said nothing.
``It has been a very precious time to me,'' Dinah went on, ``last
night and to-day--seeing two such good sons as Adam and Seth
Bede. They are so tender and thoughtful for their aged mother.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has been telling me what Adam has done, for these many
years, to help his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) brother; it's wonderful what a
spirit of wisdom and knowledge he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) has, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'s ready to use
it all in behalf of them that are feeble. And I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) has a loving
spirit too. I've noticed it often among my own people round
Snowfield, that the strong, skilful men are often the gentlest to the
women and children; and it's pretty to see ’em carrying the little
babies as if they were no heavier than little birds. And the babies
always seem to like the strong arm best. I feel sure it would be so
with Adam Bede. Don't you think so, Hetty?''
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Hetty abstractedly, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) mind had been all the
while in the wood, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would have found it difficult to say
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was assenting to. Dinah saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was not inclined to talk,
but there would not have been time to say much more, for they
were now at the yard-gate.
The still twilight, with its dying western red and its few faint
struggling stars, rested on the farm-yard, where there was not a



<p/>189

<p/>sound to be heard but the stamping of the cart-horses in the
stable. It was about twenty minutes after sunset. The fowls were
all gone to roost, and the bull-dog lay stretched on the straw
outside his (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) kennel, with the black-and-tan terrier by his (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) side, when
the falling-to of the gate disturbed them and set them barking, like
good officials, before they had any distinct knowledge of the
reason.
The barking had its effect in the house, for, as Dinah and Hetty
approached, the doorway was filled by a portly figure, with a
ruddy black-eyed face which bore in it the possibility of looking
extremely acute, and occasionally contemptuous, on market-days,
but had now a predominant after-supper expression of hearty
good-nature. It is well known that great scholars who have shown
the most pitiless acerbity in their criticism of other men's
scholarship have yet been of a relenting and indulgent temper in
private life; and I have heard of a learned man meekly rocking the
twins in the cradle with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left hand, while with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
inflicted the most lacerating sarcasms on an opponent who had
betrayed a brutal ignorance of Hebrew. Weaknesses and errors
must be forgiven--alas! they are not alien to us--but the man who
takes the wrong side on the momentous subject of the Hebrew
points must be treated as the enemy of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) race. There was the
same sort of antithetic mixture in Martin Poyser: he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was of so
excellent a disposition that he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) had been kinder and more
respectful than ever to his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) old father since he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) had made a deed of
gift of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) property, and no man judged his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) neighbours more
charitably on all personal matters; but for a farmer, like Luke
Britton, for example, whose fallows were not well cleaned, who
didn't know the rudiments of hedging and ditching, and showed



<p/>190

<p/>but a small share of judgment in the purchase of winter stock,
Martin Poyser was as hard and implacable as the north-east wind.
Luke Britton could not make a remark, even on the weather, but
Martin Poyser detected in it a taint of that unsoundness and
general ignorance which was palpable in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) farming
operations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) hated to see the fellow lift the pewter pint to his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
mouth in the bar of the Royal George on market-day, and the mere
sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) on the other side of the road brought a severe and
critical expression into his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) black eyes, as different as possible from
the fatherly glance he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) bent on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) two nieces as they approached
the door. Mr. Poyser had smoked his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) evening pipe, and now held
his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) pockets, as the only resource of a man who
continues to sit up after the day's business is done.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, lasses, ye're rather late to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) said, when they
reached the little gate leading into the causeway. <div class="bookquote">``The mother's
begun to fidget about you, an' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s got the little un ill. An' how did
you leave the old woman Bede, Dinah? Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) much down about
the old man? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d been but a poor bargain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) this five year.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s been greatly distressed for the loss of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>said Dinah,
<div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s seemed more comforted to-day. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) son Adam's been at
home all day, working at his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father's coffin, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) loves to have
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) at home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s been talking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to me almost all the
day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) has a loving heart, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s sorely given to fret and
be fearful. I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had a surer trust to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) old
age.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Adam's sure enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser, misunderstanding
Dinah's wish. ``There's no fear but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'ll yield well i' the threshing.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'s not one o' them as is all straw and no grain. I'll be bond for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) any day, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'ll be a good son to the last. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) say he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'d be

<p/>coming to see us soon? But come in, come in,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) added, making
way for them; ``I hadn't need keep y' out any longer.''
The tall buildings round the yard shut out a good deal of the
sky, but the large window let in abundant light to show every
corner of the house-place.
Mrs. Poyser, seated in the rocking-chair, which had been
brought out of the ``right-hand parlour,'' was trying to soothe Totty
to sleep. But Totty was not disposed to sleep; and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
cousins entered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) raised herself up and showed a pair of
flushed cheeks, which looked fatter than ever now they were
defined by the edge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) linen night-cap.
In the large wicker-bottomed arm-chair in the left-hand
chimney-nook sat old Martin Poyser, a hale but shrunken and
bleached image of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) portly black-haired son--his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) head hanging
forward a little, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) elbows pushed backwards so as to allow
the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) forearm to rest on the arm of the chair. His (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) blue
handkerchief was spread over his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) knees, as was usual indoors,
when it was not hanging over his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) head; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) sat watching what
went forward with the quiet outward glance of healthy old age,
which, disengaged from any interest in an inward drama, spies out
pins upon the floor, follows one's minutest motions with an
unexpectant purposeless tenacity, watches the flickering of the
flame or the sun-gleams on the wall, counts the quarries on the
floor, watches even the hand of the clock, and pleases itself with
detecting a rhythm in the tick.
``What a time o' night this is to come home, Hetty!'' said Mrs.
Poyser. ``Look at the clock, do; why, it's going on for half-past nine,
and I've sent the gells to bed this half-hour, and late enough too;
when they've got to get up at half after four, and the mowers'



<p/>192

<p/>bottles to fill, and the baking; and here's this blessed child wi' the
fever for what I know, and as wakeful as if it was dinner-time, and
nobody to help me to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) the physic but your uncle, and fine
work there's been, and half of it spilt on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) night-gown--it's well
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s swallowed more nor 'ull make her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) worse i'stead o' better.
But folks as have no mind to be o' use have allays the luck to be
out o' the road when there's anything to be done.''
``I did set out before eight, aunt,<div class="bookquote">'' said Hetty, in a pettish tone,
with a slight toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) head. But this clock's so much before the
clock at the Chase, there's no telling what time it'll be when I get
here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What! You'd be wanting the clock set by gentlefolks's time,
would you? An' sit up burnin' candle, an' lie a-bed wi' the sun abakin' you like a cowcumber i' the frame? The clock hasn't been
put forrard for the first time to-day, I reckon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>The fact was, Hetty had really forgotten the difference of the
clocks when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) told Captain Donnithorne that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) set out at
eight, and this, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) lingering pace, had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) nearly half
an hour later than usual. But here her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt's attention was
diverted from this tender subject by Totty, who, perceiving at
length that the arrival of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cousins was not likely to bring
anything satisfactory to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) in particular, began to cry, <div class="bookquote">``Munny,
munny,''  (<font color='red'><b>cousins</b></font>)</div>in an explosive manner.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, then, my pet, Mother's got her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>), Mother won't leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>);
Totty be a good dilling, and go to sleep now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser,
leaning back and rocking the chair, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) tried to make Totty
nestle against her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>). But Totty only cried louder, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Don't
yock!''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>So the mother, with that wondrous patience which love
gives to the quickest temperament, sat up again, and pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)



<p/>193

<p/>cheek against the linen night-cap and kissed it, and forgot to scold
Hetty any longer.
<div class="bookquote">``Come, Hetty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin Poyser/Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin Poyser, in a conciliatory tone, <div class="bookquote">``go
and get your supper i' the pantry, as the things are all put away;
an' then you can come and take the little un while your aunt
undresses herself, for she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) won't lie down in bed without her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
mother. An' I reckon you could eat a bit, Dinah, for they don't keep
much of a house down there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martin Poyser/Martin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you, Uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>said Dinah; <div class="bookquote">``I ate a good meal before I
came away, for Mrs. Bede would make a kettle-cake for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't want any supper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>said Hetty, taking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hat. <div class="bookquote">``I can
hold Totty now, if Aunt wants me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, what nonsense that is to talk!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser. <div class="bookquote">``Do you
think you can live wi’out eatin', an' nourish your inside wi' stickin'
red ribbons on your head? Go an' get your supper this minute,
child; there's a nice bit o' cold pudding i' the safe--just what
you're fond of.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>Hetty complied silently by going towards the pantry, and Mrs.
Poyser went on speaking to Dinah.
<div class="bookquote">``Sit down, my dear, an' look as if you knowed what it was to
make yourself a bit comfortable i' the world. I warrant the old
woman was glad to see you, since you stayed so long.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seemed to like having me there at last; but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sons say
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) doesn't like young women about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) commonly; and I thought
just at first she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was almost angry with me for going.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Eh, it's a poor look-out when th' ould folks doesna like the

seeming to trace the pattern of the quarries with his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) eye.
<div class="bookquote">``Aye, it's ill livin' in a hen-roost for them as doesn't like fleas,''



 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div><p/>194

<p/>said Mrs. Poyser. <div class="bookquote">``We've all had our turn at bein' young, I reckon,
be't good luck or ill.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must learn to 'commodate herself to young women,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser, <div class="bookquote">``for it isn't to be counted on as Adam and Seth
'ull keep bachelors for the next ten year to please their mother.
That 'ud be unreasonable. It isn't right for old nor young nayther
to make a bargain all o' their own side. What's good for one's good
all round i' the long run. I'm no friend to young fellows a-marrying
afore they know the difference atween a crab an' a apple; but they
may wait o’er long.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``To be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser; <div class="bookquote">``if you go past your dinnertime, there'll be little relish o' your meat. You turn it o’er an' o’er
wi' your fork, an' don't eat it after all. You find faut wi' your meat,
an' the faut's all i' your own stomach.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>Hetty now came back from the pantry and said, <div class="bookquote">``I can take
Totty now, Aunt, if you like.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come, Rachel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) wife seemed to hesitate,
seeing that Totty was at last nestling quietly, <div class="bookquote">``thee'dst better let
Hetty carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) upstairs, while thee tak'st thy things off. Thee 't
tired. It's time thee wast in bed. Thee 't bring on the pain in thy

 (<font color='red'><b>Totty</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) may hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) if the child 'ull go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Poyser. Hetty went close to the rocking-chair, and stood without
her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) usual smile, and without any attempt to entice Totty, simply
waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) aunt to give the child into her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) hands.
<div class="bookquote">``Wilt go to Cousin Hetty, my dilling, while mother gets ready to
go to bed? Then Totty shall go into Mother's bed, and sleep there
all night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>Before her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) mother had done speaking, Totty had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)



<p/>195

<p/>answer in an unmistakable manner, by knitting her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) brow, setting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) tiny teeth against her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) underlip, and leaning forward to slap
Hetty on the arm with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) utmost force. Then, without speaking,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) nestled to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mother again.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, hey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser, while Hetty stood without moving,
<div class="bookquote">``not go to Cousin Hetty? That's like a babby. Totty's a little
woman, an' not a babby.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's no use trying to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
allays takes against Hetty when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) isn't well. Happen she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'ll go to
Dinah.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>Dinah, having taken off her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) bonnet and shawl, had hitherto
kept quietly seated in the background, not liking to thrust herself
between Hetty and what was considered Hetty's proper work. But
now she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) came forward, and, putting out her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) arms, said, <div class="bookquote">``Come
Totty, come and let Dinah carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) upstairs along with Mother:
poor, poor Mother! she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s so tired--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) wants to go to bed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Totty turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) face towards Dinah, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) an
instant, then lifted herself up, put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) little arms, and let Dinah
lift her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) mother's lap. Hetty turned away without any sign
of ill humour, and, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hat from the table, stood waiting
with an air of indifference, to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) should be told to do
anything else.
<div class="bookquote">``You may make the door fast now, Poyser; Alick's been come in
this long while,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser, rising with an appearance of
relief from her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) low chair. <div class="bookquote">``Get me the matches down, Hetty, for I
must have the rushlight burning i' my room. Come, Father.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martin Poyser/Martin</b></font>)</div>The heavy wooden bolts began to roll in the house doors, and
old Martin prepared to move, by gathering up his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) blue
handkerchief, and reaching his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) bright knobbed walnut-tree stick



<p/>196

<p/>from the corner. Mrs. Poyser then led the way out of the kitchen,
followed by the grandfather, and Dinah with Totty in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) arms--
all going to bed by twilight, like the birds. Mrs. Poyser, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) way,
peeped into the room where her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) two boys lay; just to see their
ruddy round cheeks on the pillow, and to hear for a moment their
light regular breathing.
<div class="bookquote">``Come, Hetty, get to bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser, in a soothing tone,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) himself turned to go upstairs. <div class="bookquote">``You didna mean to be late, I'll
be bound, but your aunt's been worrited to-day. Good-night, my
wench, good-night.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Chapter XV</b></font>)</div><p/>197

<p/>Chapter XV
The Two Bed-Chambers

<p/>H

<p/>etty and Dinah both slept in the second story, in rooms
adjoining each other, meagrely furnished rooms, with no
blinds to shut out the light, which was now beginning to
gather new strength from the rising of the moon--more than
enough strength to enable Hetty to move about and undress with
perfect comfort. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could see quite well the pegs in the old
painted linen-press on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hung her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hat and gown; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
could see the head of every pin on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) red cloth pin-cushion; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
could see a reflection of herself in the old-fashioned looking-glass,
quite as distinct as was needful, considering that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had only to
brush her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hair and put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) night-cap. A queer old lookingglass! Hetty got into an ill temper with it almost every time she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
dressed. It had been considered a handsome glass in its day, and
had probably been bought into the Poyser family a quarter of a
century before, at a sale of genteel household furniture. Even now
an auctioneer could say something for it: it had a great deal of
tarnished gilding about it; it had a firm mahogany base, well
supplied with drawers, which opened with a decided jerk and sent
the contents leaping out from the farthest corners, without giving
you the trouble of reaching them; above all, it had a brass candlesocket on each side, which would give it an aristocratic air to the
very last. But Hetty objected to it because it had numerous dim
blotches sprinkled over the mirror, which no rubbing would
remove, and because, instead of swinging backwards and



<p/>198

<p/>forwards, it was fixed in an upright position, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could only
get one good view of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) head and neck, and that was to be had
only by sitting down on a low chair before her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) dressing-table. And
the dressing-table was no dressing-table at all, but a small old
chest of drawers, the most awkward thing in the world to sit down
before, for the big brass handles quite hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knees, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
couldn't get near the glass at all comfortably. But devout
worshippers never allow inconveniences to prevent them from
performing their religious rites, and Hetty this evening was more
bent on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) peculiar form of worship than usual.
Having taken off her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) gown and white kerchief, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) drew a key
from the large pocket that hung outside her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) petticoat, and,
unlocking one of the lower drawers in the chest, reached from it
two short bits of wax candle--secretly bought at Treddleston--and
stuck them in the two brass sockets. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) drew forth a bundle
of matches and lighted the candles; and last of all, a small redframed shilling looking-glass, without blotches. It was into this
small glass that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) chose to look first after seating herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
looked into it, smiling and turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) head on one side, for a
minute, then laid it down and took out her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) brush and comb from
an upper drawer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was going to let down her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hair, and make
herself look like that picture of a lady in Miss Lydia Donnithorne's
dressing-room. It was soon done, and the dark hyacinthine curves
fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) neck. It was not heavy, massive, merely rippling hair,
but soft and silken, running at every opportunity into delicate
rings. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) pushed it all backward to look like the picture, and
form a dark curtain, throwing into relief her (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) round white neck.
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) brush and comb and looked at herself,
folding her (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) arms before her (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>), still like the picture. Even the old



<p/>199

<p/>mottled glass couldn't help sending back a lovely image, none the
less lovely because Hetty's stays were not of white satin--such as I
feel sure heroines must generally wear--but of a dark greenish
cotton texture.
Oh yes! She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was very pretty. Captain Donnithorne thought so.
Prettier than anybody about Hayslope--prettier than any of the
ladies she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had ever seen visiting at the Chase--indeed it seemed
fine ladies were rather old and ugly--and prettier than Miss
Bacon, the miller's daughter, who was called the beauty of
Treddleston. And Hetty looked at herself to-night with quite a
different sensation from what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had ever felt before; there was
an invisible spectator whose eye rested on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) like morning on the
flowers. His (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) soft voice was saying over and over again those pretty
things she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had heard in the wood; his (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) arm was round her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), and the
delicate rose-scent of his (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) hair was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) still. The vainest
woman is never thoroughly conscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own beauty till she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is
loved by the man who sets her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own passion vibrating in return.
But Hetty seemed to have made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mind that something
was wanting, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) got up and reached an old black lace scarf out
of the linen-press, and a pair of large ear-rings out of the sacred
drawer from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) candles. It was an old old
scarf, full of rents, but it would make a becoming border round her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
shoulders, and set off the whiteness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) upper arm. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
would take out the little ear-rings she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) ears--oh, how
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt had scolded her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) for having her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) ears bored!--and put in
those large ones. They were but coloured glass and gilding, but if
you didn't know what they were made of, they looked just as well
as what the ladies wore. And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) sat down again, with the large
ear-rings in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) ears, and the black lace scarf adjusted round her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)



<p/>200

<p/>shoulders. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) arms: no arms could be prettier
down to a little way below the elbow--they were white and plump,
and dimpled to match her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cheeks; but towards the wrist, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
thought with vexation that they were coarsened by butter-making
and other work that ladies never did.
Captain Donnithorne couldn't like her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to go on doing work: he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>)
would like to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) in nice clothes, and thin shoes, and white
stockings, perhaps with silk clocks to them; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) must love her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
very much--no one else had ever put his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) in that way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) would want to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and make a
lady of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could hardly dare to shape the thought--yet how
else could it be? Marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) quite secretly, as Mr. James, the
doctor's assistant, married the doctor's niece, and nobody ever
found it out for a long while after, and then it was of no use to be
angry. The doctor had told her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) aunt all about it in Hetty's hearing.
She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) didn't know how it would be, but it was quite plain the old
Squire could never be told anything about it, for Hetty was ready
to faint with awe and fright if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) came across him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) at the Chase.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) might have been earth-born, for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knew. It had never
entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) had been young like other men; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) had
always been the old Squire at whom everybody was frightened.
Oh, it was impossible to think how it would be! But Captain
Donnithorne would know; he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) was a great gentleman, and could
have his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) way in everything, and could buy everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) liked.
And nothing could be as it had been again: perhaps some day she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
should be a grand lady, and ride in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) coach, and dress for dinner
in a brocaded silk, with feathers in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hair, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) dress
sweeping the ground, like Miss Lydia and Lady Dacey, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dacey</b></font>)
saw them going into the dining-room one evening as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dacey</b></font>) peeped



<p/>201

<p/>through the little round window in the lobby; only she (<font color='blue'><b>Dacey</b></font>) should not
be old and ugly like Miss Lydia, or all the same thickness like Lady
Dacey, but very pretty, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dacey</b></font>) hair done in a great many
different ways, and sometimes in a pink dress, and sometimes in a
white one--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dacey</b></font>) didn't know which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dacey</b></font>) liked best; and Mary Burge
and everybody would perhaps see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dacey</b></font>) going out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dacey</b></font>) carriage--
or rather, they would hear of it: it was impossible to imagine these
things happening at Hayslope in sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dacey</b></font>) aunt. At the thought
of all this splendour, Hetty got up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) chair, and in doing so
caught the little red-framed glass with the edge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) scarf, so
that it fell with a bang on the floor; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was too eagerly
occupied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) vision to care about picking it up; and after a
momentary start, began to pace with a pigeon-like stateliness
backwards and forwards along her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) room, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) coloured stays
and coloured skirt, and the old black lace scarf round her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
shoulders, and the great glass ear-rings in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) ears.
How pretty the little puss looks in that odd dress! It would be
the easiest folly in the world to fall in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>): there is such a
sweet baby-like roundness about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) face and figure; the delicate
dark rings of hair lie so charmingly about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) ears and neck; her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
great dark eyes with their long eye-lashes touch one so strangely,
as if an imprisoned frisky sprite looked out of them.
Ah, what a prize the man gets who wins a sweet bride like
Hetty! How the men envy him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who come to the wedding breakfast,
and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hanging on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) white lace and orange
blossoms. The dear, young, round, soft, flexible thing! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heart
must be just as soft, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) temper just as free from angles, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
character just as pliant. If anything ever goes wrong, it must be the
husband's fault there: he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) can make her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) likes--that is



<p/>202

<p/>plain. And the lover himself thinks so too: the little darling is so
fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) little vanities are so bewitching, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) wouldn't
consent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) being a bit wiser; those kitten-like glances and
movements are just what one wants to make one's hearth a
paradise. Every man under such circumstances is conscious of
being a great physiognomist. Nature, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows, has a language of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) own, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) uses with strict veracity, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) considers
himself an adept in the language. Nature has written out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
bride's character for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in those exquisite lines of cheek and lip
and chin, in those eyelids delicate as petals, in those long lashes
curled like the stamen of a flower, in the dark liquid depths of
those wonderful eyes. How she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) will dote on her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) children! She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) is
almost a child herself, and the little pink round things will hang
about her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) like florets round the central flower; and the husband
will look on, smiling benignly, able, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) chooses, to
withdraw into the sanctuary of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wisdom, towards which his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
sweet wife will look reverently, and never lift the curtain. It is a
marriage such as they made in the golden age, when the men were
all wise and majestic and the women all lovely and loving.
It was very much in this way that our friend Adam Bede
thought about Hetty; only he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) thoughts into different words.
If ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) behaved with cold vanity towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) said to
himself it is only because she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) doesn't love me well enough; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>)
was sure that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) love, whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) gave it, would be the most
precious thing a man could possess on earth. Before you despise
Adam as deficient in penetration, pray ask yourself if you were
ever predisposed to believe evil of any pretty woman--if you ever
could, without hard head-breaking demonstration, believe evil of
the one supremely pretty woman who has bewitched you. No:



<p/>203

<p/>people who love downy peaches are apt not to think of the stone,
and sometimes jar their teeth terribly against it.
Arthur Donnithorne, too, had the same sort of notion about
Hetty, so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) had thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) nature of all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) felt sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
was a dear, affectionate, good little thing. The man who awakes
the wondering tremulous passion of a young girl always thinks her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
affectionate; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chances to look forward to future years,
probably imagines himself being virtuously tender to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), because
the poor thing is so clingingly fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). God made these dear
women so--and it is a convenient arrangement in case of sickness.
After all, I believe the wisest of us must be beguiled in this way
sometimes, and must think both better and worse of people than
they deserve. Nature has her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) language, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is not
unveracious; but we don't know all the intricacies of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) syntax
just yet, and in a hasty reading we may happen to extract the very
opposite of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) real meaning. Long dark eyelashes, now--what
can be more exquisite? I find it impossible not to expect some
depth of soul behind a deep grey eye with a long dark eyelash, in
spite of an experience which has shown me that they may go along
with deceit, peculation, and stupidity. But if, in the reaction of
disgust, I have betaken myself to a fishy eye, there has been a
surprising similarity of result. One begins to suspect at length that
there is no direct correlation between eyelashes and morals; or
else, that the eyelashes express the disposition of the fair one's
grandmother, which is on the whole less important to us.
No eyelashes could be more beautiful than Hetty's; and now,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) walks with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) pigeon-like stateliness along the room
and looks down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) shoulders bordered by the old black lace,
the dark fringe shows to perfection on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) pink cheek. They are



<p/>204

<p/>but dim ill-defined pictures that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) narrow bit of an imagination
can make of the future; but of every picture she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) is the central
figure in fine clothes; Captain Donnithorne is very close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>),
putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), perhaps kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), and everybody
else is admiring and envying her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)--especially Mary Burge, whose
new print dress looks very contemptible by the side of Hetty's
resplendent toilette. Does any sweet or sad memory mingle with
this dream of the future--any loving thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) second
parents--of the children she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had helped to tend--of any youthful
companion, any pet animal, any relic of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) own childhood even?
Not one. There are some plants that have hardly any roots: you
may tear them from their native nook of rock or wall, and just lay
them over your ornamental flower-pot, and they blossom none the
worse. Hetty could have cast all her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) past life behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and never
cared to be reminded of it again. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had no feeling at all
towards the old house, and did not like the Jacob's Ladder and the
long row of hollyhocks in the garden better than other flowers--
perhaps not so well. It was wonderful how little she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) seemed to care
about waiting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) uncle, who had been a good father to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)--
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hardly ever remembered to reach him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pipe at the right
time without being told, unless a visitor happened to be there, who
would have a better opportunity of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) walked
across the hearth. Hetty did not understand how anybody could be
very fond of middle-aged people. And as for those tiresome
children, Marty and Tommy and Totty, they had been the very
nuisance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) life--as bad as buzzing insects that will come
teasing you on a hot day when you want to be quiet. Marty, the
eldest, was a baby when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) first came to the farm, for the
children born before him (<font color='blue'><b>Marty</b></font>) had died, and so Hetty had had them all



<p/>205

<p/>three, one after the other, toddling by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) side in the meadow, or
playing about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) on wet days in the half-empty rooms of the large
old house. The boys were out of hand now, but Totty was still a
day-long plague, worse than either of the others had been, because
there was more fuss made about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). And there was no end to the
making and mending of clothes. Hetty would have been glad to
hear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) should never see a child again; they were worse than
the nasty little lambs that the shepherd was always bringing in to
be taken special care of in lambing time; for the lambs were got rid
of sooner or later. As for the young chickens and turkeys, Hetty
would have hated the very word <div class="bookquote">``hatching,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>if her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt had not
bribed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to attend to the young poultry by promising her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) the
proceeds of one out of every brood. The round downy chicks
peeping out from under their mother's wing never touched Hetty
with any pleasure; that was not the sort of prettiness she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cared
about, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) did care about the prettiness of the new things she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
would buy for herself at Treddleston Fair with the money they
fetched. And yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) looked so dimpled, so charming, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
stooped down to put the soaked bread under the hen-coop, that
you must have been a very acute personage indeed to suspect her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
of that hardness. Molly, the housemaid, with a turn-up nose and a
protuberant jaw, was really a tender-hearted girl, and, as Mrs.
Poyser said, a jewel to look after the poultry; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) stolid face
showed nothing of this maternal delight, any more than a brown
earthenware pitcher will show the light of the lamp within it.
It is generally a feminine eye that first detects the moral
deficiencies hidden under the <div class="bookquote">``dear deceit''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>of beauty, so it is not
surprising that Mrs. Poyser, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) keenness and abundant
opportunity for observation, should have formed a tolerably fair



<p/>206

<p/>estimate of what might be expected from Hetty in the way of
feeling, and in moments of indignation she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had sometimes spoken
with great openness on the subject to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) husband.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)'s no better than a peacock, as 'ud strut about on the wall
and spread its tail when the sun shone if all the folks i' the parish
was dying: there's nothing seems to give her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) a turn i' th' inside,
not even when we thought Totty had tumbled into the pit. To
think o' that dear cherub! And we found her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) wi' her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) little shoes
stuck i' the mud an' crying fit to break her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) heart by the far horsepit. But Hetty never minded it, I could see, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s been at
the nussin' o' the child ever since it was a babby. It's my belief her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
heart's as hard as a pebble.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser, <div class="bookquote">``thee mustn't judge Hetty too
hard. Them young gells are like the unripe grain; they'll make
good meal by and by, but they're squashy as yet. Thee 't see Hetty
'll be all right when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s got a good husband and children of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
own.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to be hard upo' the gell. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s got cliver fingers of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) own, and can be useful enough when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) likes and I should
miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) wi' the butter, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s got a cool hand. An' let be what
may, I'd strive to do my part by a niece o' yours--an' that I've
done, for I've taught her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) everything as belongs to a house, an' I've

to spare, an' that catchin' pain comes on dreadful by times. Wi'
them three gells in the house I'd need have twice the strength to
keep ’em up to their work. It's like having roast meat at three fires;
as soon as you've basted one, another's burnin'.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>Hetty stood sufficiently in awe of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt to be anxious to
conceal from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) so much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) vanity as could be hidden without



<p/>207

<p/>too great a sacrifice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could not resist spending her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) money in
bits of finery which Mrs. Poyser disapproved; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) would have
been ready to die with shame, vexation, and fright if her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) aunt had
this moment opened the door, and seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) bits of candle
lighted, and strutting about decked in her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) scarf and ear-rings. To
prevent such a surprise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) always bolted her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) door, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) had
not forgotten to do so to-night. It was well: for there now came a
light tap, and Hetty, with a leaping heart, rushed to blow out the
candles and throw them into the drawer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) dared not stay to
take out her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) ear-rings, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) threw off her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) scarf, and let it fall on
the floor, before the light tap came again. We shall know how it
was that the light tap came, if we leave Hetty for a short time and
return to Dinah, at the moment when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had delivered Totty to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) mother's arms, and was come upstairs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) bedroom,
adjoining Hetty's.
Dinah delighted in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) bedroom window. Being on the second
story of that tall house, it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) a wide view over the fields. The
thickness of the wall formed a broad step about a yard below the
window, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) could place her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) chair. And now the first thing
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) did on entering her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) room was to seat herself in this chair and
look out on the peaceful fields beyond which the large moon was
rising, just above the hedgerow elms. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) liked the pasture best
where the milch cows were lying, and next to that the meadow
where the grass was half-mown, and lay in silvered sweeping lines.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) heart was very full, for there was to be only one more night on
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would look out on those fields for a long time to come;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) thought little of leaving the mere scene, for, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), bleak
Snowfield had just as many charms. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) thought of all the dear
people whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had learned to care for among these peaceful



<p/>208

<p/>fields, and who would now have a place in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) loving
remembrance for ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) thought of the struggles and the
weariness that might lie before them in the rest of their life's
journey, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would be away from them, and know nothing of
what was befalling them; and the pressure of this thought soon
became too strong for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) to enjoy the unresponding stillness of
the moonlit fields. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) eyes, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) might feel more
intensely the presence of a Love and Sympathy deeper and more
tender than was breathed from the earth and sky. That was often
Dinah's mode of praying in solitude. Simply to close her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) eyes and
to feel herself enclosed by the Divine Presence; then gradually her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
fears, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) yearning anxieties for others, melted away like icecrystals in a warm ocean. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had sat in this way perfectly still,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hands crossed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) lap and the pale light resting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
calm face, for at least ten minutes when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was startled by a loud
sound, apparently of something falling in Hetty's room. But like all
sounds that fall on our ears in a state of abstraction, it had no
distinct character, but was simply loud and startling, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
felt uncertain whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had interpreted it rightly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) rose and
listened, but all was quiet afterwards, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) reflected that Hetty
might merely have knocked something down in getting into bed.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) began slowly to undress; but now, owing to the suggestions of
this sound, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thoughts became concentrated on Hetty--that
sweet young thing, with life and all its trials before her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)--the
solemn daily duties of the wife and mother--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mind so
unprepared for them all, bent merely on little foolish, selfish
pleasures, like a child hugging its toys in the beginning of a long
toilsome journey in which it will have to bear hunger and cold and
unsheltered darkness. Dinah felt a double care for Hetty, because



<p/>209

<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) shared Seth's anxious interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) brother's lot, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had
not come to the conclusion that Hetty did not love Adam well
enough to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) saw too clearly the absence of any
warm, self-devoting love in Hetty's nature to regard the coldness
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) behaviour towards Adam as any indication that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was not
the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would like to have for a husband. And this blank in
Hetty's nature, instead of exciting Dinah's dislike, only touched
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) with a deeper pity: the lovely face and form affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) as
beauty always affects a pure and tender mind, free from selfish
jealousies. It was an excellent divine gift, that gave a deeper
pathos to the need, the sin, the sorrow with which it was mingled,
as the canker in a lily-white bud is more grievous to behold than in
a common pot-herb.
By the time Dinah had undressed and put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) night-gown,
this feeling about Hetty had gathered a painful intensity; her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
imagination had created a thorny thicket of sin and sorrow, in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) saw the poor thing struggling torn and bleeding,
looking with tears for rescue and finding none. It was in this way
that Dinah's imagination and sympathy acted and reacted
habitually, each heightening the other. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) felt a deep longing to
go now and pour into Hetty's ear all the words of tender warning
and appeal that rushed into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mind. But perhaps Hetty was
already asleep. Dinah put her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) ear to the partition and heard still
some slight noises, which convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) that Hetty was not yet in
bed. Still she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hesitated; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was not quite certain of a divine
direction; the voice that told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to go to Hetty seemed no stronger
that the other voice which said that Hetty was weary, and that
going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) now in an unseasonable moment would only tend to
close her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heart more obstinately. Dinah was not satisfied without a



<p/>210

<p/>more unmistakable guidance than those inward voices. There was
light enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) Bible, to discern the text
sufficiently to know what it would say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) knew the
physiognomy of every page, and could tell on what book she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
opened, sometimes on what chapter, without seeing title or
number. It was a small thick Bible, worn quite round at the edges.
Dinah laid it sideways on the window ledge, where the light was
strongest, and then opened it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) forefinger. The first words
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) looked at were those at the top of the left-hand page: <div class="bookquote">``And
they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>That
was enough for Dinah; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had opened on that memorable parting
at Ephesus, when Paul had felt bound to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart in a last
exhortation and warning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hesitated no longer, but, opening
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) own door gently, went and tapped on Hetty's. We know she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
had to tap twice, because Hetty had to put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) candles and
throw off her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) black lace scarf; but after the second tap the door
was opened immediately. Dinah said, <div class="bookquote">``Will you let me come in,
Hetty?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>and Hetty, without speaking, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was confused and
vexed, opened the door wider and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) in.
What a strange contrast the two figures made, visible enough in
that mingled twilight and moonlight! Hetty, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cheeks flushed
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eyes glistening from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) imaginary drama, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) beautiful
neck and arms bare, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hair hanging in a curly tangle down her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
back, and the baubles in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) ears. Dinah, covered with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) long
white dress, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) pale face full of subdued emotion, almost like a
lovely corpse into which the soul has returned charged with
sublimer secrets and a sublimer love. They were nearly of the
same height; Dinah evidently a little the taller as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) arm
round Hetty's waist and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) forehead.



<p/>211

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew you were not in bed, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) sweet
clear voice, which was irritating to Hetty, mingling with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) own
peevish vexation like music with jangling chains, <div class="bookquote">``for I heard you
moving; and I longed to speak to you again to-night, for it is the
last but one that I shall be here, and we don't know what may
happen to-morrow to keep us apart. Shall I sit down with you
while you do up your hair?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>said Hetty, hastily turning round and reaching the
second chair in the room, glad that Dinah looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) did not
notice her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) ear-rings.
Dinah sat down, and Hetty began to brush together her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hair
before twisting it up, doing it with that air of excessive indifference
which belongs to confused self-consciousness. But the expression
of Dinah's eyes gradually relieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>); they seemed unobservant
of all details.
<div class="bookquote">``Dear Hetty,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``It has been borne in upon my mind tonight that you may some day be in trouble--trouble is appointed

always feel for you and love you, you have got that friend in Dinah
Morris at Snowfield, and if you come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), or send for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)'ll
never forget this night and the words she (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) is speaking to you now.
Will you remember it, Hetty?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>said Hetty, rather frightened. <div class="bookquote">``But why should you think
I shall be in trouble? Do you know of anything?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>Hetty had seated herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) tied on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cap, and now Dinah
leaned forwards and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hands as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``Because,
dear, trouble comes to us all in this life: we set our hearts on things



<p/>212

<p/>which it isn't God's will for us to have, and then we go sorrowing;
the people we love are taken from us, and we can joy in nothing
because they are not with us; sickness comes, and we faint under
the burden of our feeble bodies; we go astray and do wrong, and
bring ourselves into trouble with our fellow-men. There is no man
or woman born into this world to whom some of these trials do not
fall, and so I feel that some of them must happen to you; and I
desire for you, that while you are young you should seek for
strength from your Heavenly Father, that you may have a support
which will not fail you in the evil day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Dinah paused and released Hetty's hands that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) might not
hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). Hetty sat quite still; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt no response within herself
to Dinah's anxious affection; but Dinah's words uttered with
solemn pathetic distinctness, affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) with a chill fear. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
flush had died away almost to paleness; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had the timidity of a
luxurious pleasure-seeking nature, which shrinks from the hint of
pain. Dinah saw the effect, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) tender anxious pleading
became the more earnest, till Hetty, full of a vague fear that
something evil was some time to befall her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), began to cry.
It is our habit to say that while the lower nature can never
understand the higher, the higher nature commands a complete
view of the lower. But I think the higher nature has to learn this
comprehension, as we learn the art of vision, by a good deal of
hard experience, often with bruises and gashes incurred in taking
things up by the wrong end, and fancying our space wider than it
is. Dinah had never seen Hetty affected in this way before, and,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) usual benignant hopefulness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) trusted it was the
stirring of a divine impulse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) kissed the sobbing thing, and
began to cry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) for grateful joy. But Hetty was simply in that



<p/>213

<p/>excitable state of mind in which there is no calculating what turn
the feelings may take from one moment to another, and for the
first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) became irritated under Dinah's caress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) pushed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) away impatiently, and said, with a childish sobbing voice,
<div class="bookquote">``Don't talk to me so, Dinah. Why do you come to frighten me? I've
never done anything to you. Why can't you let me be?''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Poor Dinah felt a pang. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was too wise to persist, and only
said mildly, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear, you're tired; I won't hinder you any
longer. Make haste and get into bed. Good-night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) went out of the room almost as quietly and quickly as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
had been a ghost; but once by the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) own bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) threw
herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) knees and poured out in deep silence all the
passionate pity that filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) heart.
As for Hetty, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was soon in the wood again--her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) waking
dreams being merged in a sleeping life scarcely more fragmentary
and confused.

<p/>Chapter XVI
Links

<p/>A

<p/>rthur Donnithorne, you remember, is under an
engagement with himself to go and see Mr. Irwine this
Friday morning, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) is awake and dressing so early
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) determines to go before breakfast, instead of after. The
rector, he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) knows, breakfasts alone at half-past nine, the ladies of
the family having a different breakfast-hour; Arthur will have an
early ride over the hill and breakfast with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). One can say
everything best over a meal.
The progress of civilisation has made a breakfast or a dinner an
easy and cheerful substitute for more troublesome and
disagreeable ceremonies. We take a less gloomy view of our errors
now our father confessor listens to us over his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) egg and coffee. We
are more distinctly conscious that rude penances are out of the
question for gentlemen in an enlightened age, and that mortal sin
is not incompatible with an appetite for muffins. An assault on our
pockets, which in more barbarous times would have been made in
the brusque form of a pistol-shot, is quite a well-bred and smiling
procedure now it has become a request for a loan thrown in as an
easy parenthesis between the second and third glasses of claret.
Still, there was this advantage in the old rigid forms, that they
committed you to the fulfilment of a resolution by some outward
deed: when you have put your mouth to one end of a hole in a
stone wall and are aware that there is an expectant ear at the
other end, you are more likely to say what you came out with the




<p/>215

<p/>intention of saying than if you were seated with your legs in an
easy attitude under the mahogany with a companion who will
have no reason to be surprised if you have nothing particular to
say.
However, Arthur Donnithorne, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) winds among the pleasant
lanes on horseback in the morning sunshine, has a sincere
determination to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) heart to the rector, and the swirling
sound of the scythe as he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) passes by the meadow is all the
pleasanter to him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) because of this honest purpose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) is glad to see
the promise of settled weather now, for getting in the hay, about
which the farmers have been fearful; and there is something so
healthful in the sharing of a joy that is general and not merely
personal, that this thought about the hay-harvest reacts on his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>)
state of mind and makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) resolution seem an easier matter. A
man about town might perhaps consider that these influences
were not to be felt out of a child's story-book; but when you are
among the fields and hedgerows, it is impossible to maintain a
consistent superiority to simple natural pleasures.
Arthur had passed the village of Hayslope and was approaching
the Broxton side of the hill, when, at a turning in the road, he (<font color='blue'><b>Broxton</b></font>) saw
a figure about a hundred yards before him (<font color='blue'><b>Broxton</b></font>) which it was impossible
to mistake for any one else than Adam Bede, even if there had
been no grey, tailless shepherd-dog at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) heels. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) was striding
along at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) usual rapid pace, and Arthur pushed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) horse to
overtake him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) retained too much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) boyish feeling for
Adam to miss an opportunity of chatting with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). I will not say
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) love for that good fellow did not owe some of its force to
the love of patronage: our friend Arthur liked to do everything that
was handsome, and to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) handsome deeds recognised.



<p/>216

<p/>Adam looked round as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) heard the quickening clatter of the
horse's heels, and waited for the horseman, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) paper cap
from his (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) head with a bright smile of recognition. Next to his (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) own
brother Seth, Adam would have done more for Arthur
Donnithorne than for any other young man in the world. There
was hardly anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would not rather have lost than the twofeet ruler which he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) always carried in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) pocket; it was Arthur's
present, bought with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) pocket-money when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was a fair-haired
lad of eleven, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had profited so well by Adam's lessons
in carpentering and turning as to embarrass every female in the
house with gifts of superfluous thread-reels and round boxes.
Adam had quite a pride in the little squire in those early days, and
the feeling had only become slightly modified as the fair-haired lad
had grown into the whiskered young man. Adam, I confess, was
very susceptible to the influence of rank, and quite ready to give
an extra amount of respect to every one who had more advantages
than himself, not being a philosopher or a proletaire with
democratic ideas, but simply a stout-limbed clever carpenter wlth
a large fund of reverence in his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) nature, which inclined him (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) to
admit all established claims unless he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) saw very clear grounds for
questioning them. He (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) had no theories about setting the world to
rights, but he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) saw there was a great deal of damage done by
building with ill-seasoned timber--by ignorant men in fine clothes
making plans for outhouses and workshops and the like without
knowing the bearings of things--by slovenly joiners' work, and by
hasty contracts that could never be fulfilled without ruining
somebody; and he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) resolved, for his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) part, to set his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) face against
such doings. On these points he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) would have maintained his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>)
opinion against the largest landed proprietor in Loamshire or



<p/>217

<p/>Stonyshire either; but he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) felt that beyond these it would be better
for him (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) to defer to people who were more knowing than himself.
He (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) saw as plainly as possible how ill the woods on the estate were
managed, and the shameful state of the farm-buildings; and if old
Squire Donnithorne had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) the effect of this
mismanagement, he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) would have spoken his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) opinion without
flinching, but the impulse to a respectful demeanour towards a
<div class="bookquote">``gentleman''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>would have been strong within him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) all the while. The
word <div class="bookquote">``gentleman''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>had a spell for Adam, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) often said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``couldn't abide a fellow who thought he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) made himself fine by
being coxy to 's betters.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I must remind you again that Adam had
the blood of the peasant in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) veins, and that since he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
prime half a century ago, you must expect some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
characteristics to be obsolete.
Towards the young squire this instinctive reverence of Adam's
was assisted by boyish memories and personal regard so you may
imagine that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought far more of Arthur's good qualities, and
attached far more value to very slight actions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), than if they
had been the qualities and actions of a common workman like
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) felt sure it would be a fine day for everybody about
Hayslope when the young squire came into the estate--such a
generous open-hearted disposition as he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) had, and an <div class="bookquote">``uncommon''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>notion about improvements and repairs, considering he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) was only
just coming of age. Thus there was both respect and affection in
the smile with which he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) paper cap as Arthur
Donnithorne rode up.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, Adam, how are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>said Arthur, holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hand.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) never shook hands with any of the farmers, and Adam felt the
honour keenly. ``I could swear to your back a long way off. It's just



<p/>218

<p/>the same back, only broader, as when you used to carry me on it.
Do you remember?''
``Aye, sir, I remember. It 'ud be a poor look-out if folks didn't
remember what they did and said when they were lads. We should
think no more about old friends than we do about new uns, then.''
``You're going to Broxton, I suppose?'' said Arthur, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
horse on at a slow pace while Adam walked by his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) side. ``Are you
going to the rectory?''
``No, sir, I'm going to see about Bradwell's barn. They're afraid
of the roof pushing the walls out, and I'm going to see what can be
done with it before we send the stuff and the workmen.''
``Why, Burge trusts almost everything to you now, Adam,
doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)? I should think he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) will make you his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) partner soon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
will, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'s wise.''
``Nay, sir, I don't see as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'d be much the better off for that. A
foreman, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'s got a conscience and delights in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) work, will do
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) business as well as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was a partner. I wouldn't give a penny
for a man as 'ud drive a nail in slack because he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) didn't get extra
pay for it.''
``I know that, Adam; I know you work for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) as well as if you
were working for yourself. But you would have more power than
you have now, and could turn the business to better account
perhaps. The old man must give up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) business sometime, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
has no son; I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll want a son-in-law who can take to it.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has rather grasping fingers of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own, I fancy. I daresay he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wants a man who can put some money into the business. If I were
not as poor as a rat, I would gladly invest some money in that way,
for the sake of having you settled on the estate. I'm sure I should
profit by it in the end. And perhaps I shall be better off in a year or



<p/>219

<p/>two. I shall have a larger allowance now I'm of age; and when I've
paid off a debt or two, I shall be able to look about me.''
``You're very good to say so, sir, and I'm not unthankful. But''--
Adam continued, in a decided tone--``I shouldn't like to make any
offers to Mr. Burge, or t' have any made for me. I see no clear road
to a partnership. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) should ever want to dispose of the business,
that 'ud be a different matter. I should be glad of some money at a
fair interest then, for I feel sure I could pay it off in time.''
``Very well, Adam,'' said Arthur, remembering what Mr. Irwine
had said about a probable hitch in the love-making between Adam
and Mary Burge, ``we'll say no more about it at present. When is
your father to be buried?''
``On Sunday, sir; Mr. Irwine's coming earlier on purpose. I shall
be glad when it's over, for I think my mother 'ull perhaps get
easier then. It cuts one sadly to see the grief of old people; they've
no way o' working it off, and the new spring brings no new shoots
out on the withered tree.''
``Ah, you've had a good deal of trouble and vexation in your life,
Adam. I don't think you've ever been hare-brained and lighthearted, like other youngsters. You've always had some care on
your mind.''
``Why, yes, sir; but that's nothing to make a fuss about. If we're
men and have men's feelings, I reckon we must have men's
troubles. We can't be like the birds, as fly from their nest as soon
as they've got their wings, and never know their kin when they see
’em, and get a fresh lot every year. I've had enough to be thankful
for: I've allays had health and strength and brains to give me a
delight in my work; and I count it a great thing as I've had Bartle
Massey's night-school to go to. He (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>)'s helped me to knowledge I



<p/>220

<p/>could never ha' got by myself.''
``What a rare fellow you are, Adam!'' said Arthur, after a pause,
in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had looked musingly at the big fellow walking by his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
side. ``I could hit out better than most men at Oxford, and yet I
believe you would knock me into next week if I were to have a
battle with you.''
``God forbid I should ever do that, sir,'' said Adam, looking
round at Arthur and smiling. ``I used to fight for fun, but I've never
done that since I was the cause o' poor Gil Tranter being laid up
for a fortnight. I'll never fight any man again, only when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
behaves like a scoundrel. If you get hold of a chap that's got no
shame nor conscience to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>), you must try what you can do
by bunging his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) eyes up.''
Arthur did not laugh, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was preoccupied with some
thought that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) say presently, ``I should think now, Adam,
you never have any struggles within yourself. I fancy you would
master a wish that you had made up your mind it was not quite
right to indulge, as easily as you would knock down a drunken
fellow who was quarrelsome with you. I mean, you are never
shilly-shally, first making up your mind that you won't do a thing,
and then doing it after all?''
``Well,'' said Adam, slowly, after a moment's hesitation, ``no. I
don't remember ever being see-saw in that way, when I'd made
my mind up, as you say, that a thing was wrong. It takes the taste
out o' my mouth for things, when I know I should have a heavy
conscience after ’em. I've seen pretty clear, ever since I could cast
up a sum, as you can never do what's wrong without breeding sin
and trouble more than you can ever see. It's like a bit o' bad
workmanship--you never see th' end o' the mischief it'll do. And



<p/>221

<p/>it's a poor look-out to come into the world to make your fellowcreatures worse off instead o' better. But there's a difference
between the things folks call wrong. I'm not for making a sin of
every little fool's trick, or bit o' nonsense anybody may be let into,
like some o' them dissenters. And a man may have two minds
whether it isn't worthwhile to get a bruise or two for the sake of a
bit o' fun. But it isn't my way to be see-saw about anything: I think
my fault lies th' other way. When I've said a thing, if it's only to
myself, it's hard for me to go back.''
``Yes, that's just what I expected of you,'' said Arthur. ``You've
got an iron will, as well as an iron arm. But however strong a
man's resolution may be, it costs him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) something to carry it out,
now and then. We may determine not to gather any cherries and
keep our hands sturdily in our pockets, but we can't prevent our
mouths from watering.''
``That's true, sir, but there's nothing like settling with ourselves
as there's a deal we must do without i' this life. It's no use looking
on life as if it was Treddles'on Fair, where folks only go to see
shows and get fairings. If we do, we shall find it different. But
where's the use o' me talking to you, sir? You know better than I
do.''
``I'm not so sure of that, Adam. You've had four or five years of
experience more than I've had, and I think your life has been a
better school to you than college has been to me.''
``Why, sir, you seem to think o' college something like what
Bartle Massey does. He (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) says college mostly makes people like
bladders--just good for nothing but t' hold the stuff as is poured
into ’em. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>)'s got a tongue like a sharp blade, Bartle has--it
never touches anything but it cuts. Here's the turning, sir. I must



<p/>222

<p/>bid you good-morning, as you're going to the rectory.''
``Good-bye, Adam, good-bye.''
Arthur gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) horse to the groom at the rectory gate, and
walked along the gravel towards the door which opened on the
garden. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knew that the rector always breakfasted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) study,
and the study lay on the left hand of this door, opposite the diningroom. It was a small low room, belonging to the old part of the
house--dark with the sombre covers of the books that lined the
walls; yet it looked very cheery this morning as Arthur reached the
open window. For the morning sun fell aslant on the great glass
globe with gold fish in it, which stood on a scagliola pillar in front
of the ready-spread bachelor breakfast-table, and by the side of
this breakfast-table was a group which would have made any room
enticing. In the crimson damask easy-chair sat Mr. Irwine, with
that radiant freshness which he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) always had when he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) came from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) morning toilet; his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) finely formed plump white hand was
playing along Juno's brown curly back; and close to Juno's tail,
which was wagging with calm matronly pleasure, the two brown
pups were rolling over each other in an ecstatic duet of worrying
noises. On a cushion a little removed sat Pug, with the air of a
maiden lady, who looked on these familiarities as animal
weaknesses, which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) made as little show as possible of
observing. On the table, at Mr. Irwine's elbow, lay the first volume
of the Foulis Æschylus, which Arthur knew well by sight; and the
silver coffee-pot, which Carroll was bringing in, sent forth a
fragrant steam which completed the delights of a bachelor
breakfast.
<div class="bookquote">``Hallo, Arthur, that's a good fellow! You're just in time,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said



<p/>223

<p/>sill. <div class="bookquote">``Carroll, we shall want more coffee and eggs, and haven't you
got some cold fowl for us to eat with that ham? Why, this is like old
days, Arthur; you haven't been to breakfast with me these five
years.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It was a tempting morning for a ride before breakfast,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>said
Arthur; <div class="bookquote">``and I used to like breakfasting with you so when I was
reading with you. My grandfather is always a few degrees colder at
breakfast than at any other hour in the day. I think his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) morning
bath doesn't agree with him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>Arthur was anxious not to imply that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) came with any special
purpose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had no sooner found himself in Mr. Irwine's presence
than the confidence which he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) had thought quite easy before,
suddenly appeared the most difficult thing in the world to him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>),
and at the very moment of shaking hands he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) purpose in
quite a new light. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) make Irwine understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
position unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) those little scenes in the wood; and
how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) tell them without looking like a fool? And then his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
weakness in coming back from Gawaine's, and doing the very
opposite of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) intended! Irwine would think him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) a shillyshally fellow ever after. However, it must come out in an
unpremeditated way; the conversation might lead up to it.
<div class="bookquote">``I like breakfast-time better than any other moment in the
day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Irwine. ``No dust has settled on one's mind then,
and it presents a clear mirror to the rays of things. I always have a
favourite book by me at breakfast, and I enjoy the bits I pick up
then so much, that regularly every morning it seems to me as if I
should certainly become studious again. But presently Dent brings
up a poor fellow who has killed a hare, and when I've got through
my `justicing,' as Carroll calls it, I'm inclined for a ride round the



<p/>224

<p/>glebe, and on my way back I meet with the master of the
workhouse, who has got a long story of a mutinous pauper to tell
me; and so the day goes on, and I'm always the same lazy fellow
before evening sets in. Besides, one wants the stimulus of
sympathy, and I have never had that since poor D’Oyley left
Treddleston. If you had stuck to your books well, you rascal, I
should have had a pleasanter prospect before me. But scholarship
doesn't run in your family blood.''
``No indeed. It's well if I can remember a little inapplicable
Latin to adorn my maiden speech in Parliament six or seven years
hence. `Cras ingens iterabimus æquor,' and a few shreds of that
sort, will perhaps stick to me, and I shall arrange my opinions so
as to introduce them. But I don't think a knowledge of the classics
is a pressing want to a country gentleman; as far as I can see, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'d
much better have a knowledge of manures. I've been reading your
friend Arthur Young's books lately, and there's nothing I should
like better than to carry out some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) ideas in putting the
farmers on a better management of their land; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) says,
making what was a wild country, all of the same dark hue, bright
and variegated with corn and cattle. My grandfather will never let
me have any power while he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) lives, but there's nothing I should like
better than to undertake the Stonyshire side of the estate--it's in a
dismal condition--and set improvements on foot, and gallop about
from one place to another and overlook them. I should like to
know all the labourers, and see them touching their hats to me
with a look of goodwill.''
``Bravo, Arthur! A man who has no feeling for the classics
couldn't make a better apology for coming into the world than by
increasing the quantity of food to maintain scholars--and rectors



<p/>225

<p/>who appreciate scholars. And whenever you enter on your career
of model landlord may I be there to see. You'll want a portly rector
to complete the picture, and take his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) tithe of all the respect and
honour you get by your hard work. Only don't set your heart too
strongly on the goodwill you are to get in consequence. I'm not
sure that men are the fondest of those who try to be useful to
them. You know Gawaine has got the curses of the whole
neighbourhood upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) about that enclosure. You must make it
quite clear to your mind which you are most bent upon, old boy--
popularity or usefulness--else you may happen to miss both.''
``Oh! Gawaine is harsh in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) manners; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) doesn't make himself
personally agreeable to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) tenants. I don't believe there's
anything you can't prevail on people to do with kindness. For my
part, I couldn't live in a neighbourhood where I was not respected
and beloved. And it's very pleasant to go among the tenants here--
they seem all so well inclined to me I suppose it seems only the
other day to them since I was a little lad, riding on a pony about as
big as a sheep. And if fair allowances were made to them, and
their buildings attended to, one could persuade them to farm on a
better plan, stupid as they are.''
<div class="bookquote">``Then mind you fall in love in the right place, and don't get a
wife who will drain your purse and make you niggardly in spite of
yourself. My mother and I have a little discussion about you
sometimes: she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says, `I ll never risk a single prophecy on Arthur
until I see the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) falls in love with.' She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thinks your ladylove will rule you as the moon rules the tides. But I feel bound to
stand up for you, as my pupil you know, and I maintain that you're
not of that watery quality. So mind you don't disgrace my
judgment.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div><p/>226

<p/>Arthur winced under this speech, for keen old Mrs. Irwine's
opinion about him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) had the disagreeable effect of a sinister omen.
This, to be sure, was only another reason for persevering in his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
intention, and getting an additional security against himself.
Nevertheless, at this point in the conversation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) was conscious of
increased disinclination to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) story about Hetty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) was of an
impressible nature, and lived a great deal in other people's
opinions and feelings concerning himself; and the mere fact that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) was in the presence of an intimate friend, who had not the
slightest notion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) had had any such serious internal struggle
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) came to confide, rather shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) own belief in the
seriousness of the struggle. It was not, after all, a thing to make a
fuss about; and what could Irwine do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) could not do
for himself? He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) would go to Eagledale in spite of Meg's lameness--
go on Rattler, and let Pym follow as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) could on the old
hack. That was his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) thought as he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) sugared his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) coffee; but the next
minute, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) was lifting the cup to his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) lips, he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) remembered how
thoroughly he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) mind last night to tell Irwine. No!
He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) would not be vacillating again--he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) would do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) had
meant to do, this time. So it would be well not to let the personal
tone of the conversation altogether drop. If they went to quite
indifferent topics, his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) difficulty would be heightened. It had
required no noticeable pause for this rush and rebound of feeling,
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``But I think it is hardly an argument against
a man's general strength of character that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) should be apt to be
mastered by love. A fine constitution doesn't insure one against
smallpox or any other of those inevitable diseases. A man may be
very firm in other matters and yet be under a sort of witchery from
a woman.''



 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>227

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but there's this difference between love and smallpox, or
bewitchment either--that if you detect the disease at an early
stage and try change of air, there is every chance of complete
escape without any further development of symptoms. And there
are certain alternative doses which a man may administer to
himself by keeping unpleasant consequences before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind: this
gives you a sort of smoked glass through which you may look at
the resplendent fair one and discern her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) true outline; though I'm
afraid, by the by, the smoked glass is apt to be missing just at the
moment it is most wanted. I daresay, now, even a man fortified
with a knowledge of the classics might be lured into an imprudent
marriage, in spite of the warning given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the chorus in the
Prometheus.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>The smile that flitted across Arthur's face was a faint one, and
instead of following Mr. Irwine's playful lead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) said, quite
seriously--<div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's the worst of it. It's a desperately vexatious
thing, that after all one's reflections and quiet determinations, we
should be ruled by moods that one can't calculate on beforehand. I
don't think a man ought to be blamed so much if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is betrayed
into doing things in that way, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resolutions.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but the moods lie in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nature, my boy, just as much as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
reflections did, and more. A man can never do anything at
variance with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own nature. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) carries within him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the germ of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) most exceptional action; and if we wise people make eminent
fools of ourselves on any particular occasion, we must endure the
legitimate conclusion that we carry a few grains of folly to our
ounce of wisdom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Well, but one may be betrayed into doing things by a
combination of circumstances, which one might never have done



<p/>228

<p/>otherwise.''
``Why, yes, a man can't very well steal a bank-note unless the
bank-note lies within convenient reach; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't make us
think him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an honest man because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) begins to howl at the banknote for falling in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way.''
``But surely you don't think a man who struggles against a
temptation into which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) falls at last as bad as the man who never
struggles at all?''
<div class="bookquote">``No, certainly; I pity him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in proportion to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) struggles, for they
foreshadow the inward suffering which is the worst form of
Nemesis. Consequences are unpitying. Our deeds carry their
terrible consequences, quite apart from any fluctuations that went
before--consequences that are hardly ever confined to ourselves.
And it is best to fix our minds on that certainty, instead of
considering what may be the elements of excuse for us. But I
never knew you so inclined for moral discussion, Arthur? Is it
some danger of your own that you are considering in this
philosophical, general way?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>In asking this question, Mr. Irwine pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) plate away,
threw himself back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) chair, and looked straight at Arthur. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
really suspected that Arthur wanted to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) something, and
thought of smoothing the way for him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) by this direct question. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was mistaken. Brought suddenly and involuntarily to the brink
of confession, Arthur shrank back and felt less disposed towards it
than ever. The conversation had taken a more serious tone than
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had intended--it would quite mislead Irwine--he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) would
imagine there was a deep passion for Hetty, while there was no
such thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) was conscious of colouring, and was annoyed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
boyishness.



<p/>229

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, no danger,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) said as indifferently as he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) could. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
know that I am more liable to irresolution than other people; only
there are little incidents now and then that set one speculating on
what might happen in the future.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>Was there a motive at work under this strange reluctance of
Arthur's which had a sort of backstairs influence, not admitted to
himself? Our mental business is carried on much in the same way
as the business of the State: a great deal of hard work is done by
agents who are not acknowledged. In a piece of machinery, too, I
believe there is often a small unnoticeable wheel which has a great
deal to do with the motion of the large obvious ones. Possibly
there was some such unrecognised agent secretly busy in Arthur's
mind at this moment--possibly it was the fear lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) might
hereafter find the fact of having made a confession to the rector a
serious annoyance, in case he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) should not be able quite to carry out
his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) good resolutions? I dare not assert that it was not so. The
human soul is a very complex thing.
The idea of Hetty had just crossed Mr. Irwine's mind as he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
looked inquiringly at Arthur, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) disclaiming indifferent
answer confirmed the thought which had quickly followed--that
there could be nothing serious in that direction. There was no
probability that Arthur ever saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) except at church, and at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
own home under the eye of Mrs. Poyser; and the hint he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had given
Arthur about her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) the other day had no more serious meaning than
to prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) from noticing her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) so as to rouse the little chit's
vanity, and in this way perturb the rustic drama of her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) life. Arthur
would soon join his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) regiment, and be far away: no, there could be
no danger in that quarter, even if Arthur's character had not been
a strong security against it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) honest, patronising pride in the



<p/>230

<p/>good-will and respect of everybody about him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was a safeguard
even against foolish romance, still more against a lower kind of
folly. If there had been anything special on Arthur's mind in the
previous conversation, it was clear he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was not inclined to enter
into details, and Mr. Irwine was too delicate to imply even a
friendly curiosity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) perceived a change of subject would be
welcome, and said--
<div class="bookquote">``By the way, Arthur, at your colonel's birthday fête there were
some transparencies that made a great effect in honour of
Britannia, and Pitt, and the Loamshire Militia, and, above all, the
`generous youth,' the hero of the day. Don't you think you should
get up something of the same sort to astonish our weak minds?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>The opportunity was gone. While Arthur was hesitating, the
rope to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) might have clung had drifted away--he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) must
trust now to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own swimming.
In ten minutes from that time, Mr. Irwine was called for on
business, and Arthur, bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) good-bye, mounted his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) horse
again with a sense of dissatisfaction, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) tried to quell by
determining to set off for Eagledale without an hour's delay.

<p/>Book Second




<p/>232

<p/>Chapter XVII
In Which the Story Pauses a Little

<p/>``T

<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) Rector of Broxton is little better than a pagan!'' I
hear one of my readers exclaim. <div class="bookquote">``How much more
edifying it would have been if you had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) give
Arthur some truly spiritual advice! You might have put into his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
mouth the most beautiful things--quite as good as reading a
sermon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Certainly I could, if I held it the highest vocation of the novelist
to represent things as they never have been and never will be.
Then, of course, I might refashion life and character entirely after
my own liking; I might select the most unexceptionable type of
clergyman and put my own admirable opinions into his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) mouth on
all occasions. But it happens, on the contrary, that my strongest
effort is to avoid any such arbitrary picture, and to give a faithful
account of men and things as they have mirrored themselves in
my mind. The mirror is doubtless defective, the outlines will
sometimes be disturbed, the reflection faint or confused; but I feel
as much bound to tell you as precisely as I can what that reflection
is, as if I were in the witness-box, narrating my experience on
oath.
Sixty years ago--it is a long time, so no wonder things have
changed--all clergymen were not zealous; indeed, there is reason
to believe that the number of zealous clergymen was small, and it
is probable that if one among the small minority had owned the
livings of Broxton and Hayslope in the year 1799, you would have




<p/>233

<p/>liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Broxton</b></font>) no better than you like Mr. Irwine. Ten to one, you
would have thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) a tasteless, indiscreet, methodistical man.
It is so very rarely that facts hit that nice medium required by our
own enlightened opinions and refined taste! Perhaps you will say,
<div class="bookquote">``Do improve the facts a little, then; make them more accordant
with those correct views which it is our privilege to possess. The
world is not just what we like; do touch it up with a tasteful pencil,
and make believe it is not quite such a mixed entangled affair. Let
all
people
who
hold
unexceptionable
opinions
act
unexceptionably. Let your most faulty characters always be on the
wrong side, and your virtuous ones on the right. Then we shall see
at a glance whom we are to condemn and whom we are to
approve. Then we shall be able to admire, without the slightest
disturbance of our prepossessions: we shall hate and despise with
that true ruminant relish which belongs to undoubting
confidence.''
 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>But, my good friend, what will you do then with your fellowparishioner who opposes your husband in the vestry? With your
newly appointed vicar, whose style of preaching you find painfully
below that of his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) regretted predecessor? With the honest servant
who worries your soul with her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) one failing? With your neighbour,
Mrs. Green, who was really kind to you in your last illness, but has
said several ill-natured things about you since your
convalescence? Nay, with your excellent husband himself, who
has other irritating habits besides that of not wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shoes?
These fellow-mortals, every one, must be accepted as they are: you
can neither straighten their noses, nor brighten their wit, nor
rectify their dispositions; and it is these people--amongst whom
your life is passed--that it is needful you should tolerate, pity, and



<p/>234

<p/>love: it is these more or less ugly, stupid, inconsistent people
whose movements of goodness you should be able to admire--for
whom you should cherish all possible hopes, all possible patience.
And I would not, even if I had the choice, be the clever novelist
who could create a world so much better than this, in which we get
up in the morning to do our daily work, that you would be likely to
turn a harder, colder eye on the dusty streets and the common
green fields--on the real breathing men and women, who can be
chilled by your indifference or injured by your prejudice; who can
be cheered and helped onward by your fellow-feeling, your
forbearance, your outspoken, brave justice.
So I am content to tell my simple story, without trying to make
things seem better than they were; dreading nothing, indeed, but
falsity, which, in spite of one's best efforts, there is reason to
dread. Falsehood is so easy, truth so difficult. The pencil is
conscious of a delightful facility in drawing a griffin--the longer
the claws, and the larger the wings, the better; but that marvellous
facility which we mistook for genius is apt to forsake us when we
want to draw a real unexaggerated lion. Examine your words well,
and you will find that even when you have no motive to be false, it
is a very hard thing to say the exact truth, even about your own
immediate feelings--much harder than to say something fine
about them which is not the exact truth.
It is for this rare, precious quality of truthfulness that I delight
in many Dutch paintings, which lofty-minded people despise. I
find a source of delicious sympathy in these faithful pictures of a
monotonous homely existence, which has been the fate of so many
more among my fellow-mortals than a life of pomp or of absolute
indigence, of tragic suffering or of world-stirring actions. I turn,



<p/>235

<p/>without shrinking, from cloud-borne angels, from prophets, sibyls,
and heroic warriors, to an old woman bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) flower-pot,
or eating her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) solitary dinner, while the noonday light, softened
perhaps by a screen of leaves, falls on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mob-cap, and just
touches the rim of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spinning-wheel, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stone jug, and all
those cheap common things which are the precious necessaries of
life to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--or I turn to that village wedding, kept between four
brown walls, where an awkward bridegroom opens the dance with
a high-shouldered, broad-faced bride, while elderly and middleaged friends look on, with very irregular noses and lips, and
probably with quart-pots in their hands, but with an expression of
unmistakable contentment and goodwill. <div class="bookquote">``Foh!''  (<font color='red'><b>friend details</b></font>)</div>says my idealistic
friend, <div class="bookquote">``what vulgar details! What good is there in taking all these
pains to give an exact likeness of old women and clowns? What a
low phase of life! What clumsy, ugly people!''
 (<font color='red'><b>friend details</b></font>)</div>But bless us, things may be lovable that are not altogether
handsome, I hope? I am not at all sure that the majority of the
human race have not been ugly, and even among those <div class="bookquote">``lords of
their kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>the majority</b></font>)</div>the British, squat figures, ill-shapen nostrils, and
dingy complexions are not startling exceptions. Yet there is a great
deal of family love amongst us. I have a friend or two whose class
of features is such that the Apollo curl on the summit of their
brows would be decidedly trying; yet to my certain knowledge
tender hearts have beaten for them, and their miniatures--
flattering, but still not lovely--are kissed in secret by motherly
lips. I have seen many an excellent matron, who could have never
in her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) best days have been handsome, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) had a packet of
yellow love-letters in a private drawer, and sweet children
showered kisses on her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) sallow cheeks. And I believe there have



<p/>236

<p/>been plenty of young heroes, of middle stature and feeble beards,
who have felt quite sure they could never love anything more
insignificant than a Diana, and yet have found themselves in
middle life happily settled with a wife who waddles. Yes! Thank
God; human feeling is like the mighty rivers that bless the earth: it
does not wait for beauty--it flows with resistless force and brings
beauty with it.
All honour and reverence to the divine beauty of form! Let us
cultivate it to the utmost in men, women, and children--in our
gardens and in our houses. But let us love that other beauty too,
which lies in no secret of proportion, but in the secret of deep
human sympathy. Paint us an angel, if you can, with a floating
violet robe, and a face paled by the celestial light; paint us yet
oftener a Madonna, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) mild face upward and opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>)
arms to welcome the divine glory; but do not impose on us any
aesthetic rules which shall banish from the region of Art those old
women scraping carrots with their work-worn hands, those heavy
clowns taking holiday in a dingy pot-house, those rounded backs
and stupid weather-beaten faces that have bent over the spade
and done the rough work of the world--those homes with their tin
pans, their brown pitchers, their rough curs, and their clusters of
onions. In this world there are so many of these common coarse
people, who have no picturesque sentimental wretchedness! It is
so needful we should remember their existence, else we may
happen to leave them quite out of our religion and philosophy and
frame lofty theories which only fit a world of extremes. Therefore,
let Art always remind us of them; therefore let us always have men
ready to give the loving pains of a life to the faithful representing
of commonplace things--men who see beauty in these



<p/>237

<p/>commonplace things, and delight in showing how kindly the light
of heaven falls on them. There are few prophets in the world; few
sublimely beautiful women; few heroes. I can't afford to give all
my love and reverence to such rarities: I want a great deal of those
feelings for my every-day fellow-men, especially for the few in the
foreground of the great multitude, whose faces I know, whose
hands I touch for whom I have to make way with kindly courtesy.
Neither are picturesque lazzaroni or romantic criminals half so
frequent as your common labourer, who gets his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) own bread and
eats it vulgarly but creditably with his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) own pocket-knife. It is more
needful that I should have a fibre of sympathy connecting me with
that vulgar citizen who weighs out my sugar in a vilely assorted
cravat and waistcoat, than with the handsomest rascal in red scarf
and green feathers--more needful that my heart should swell with
loving admiration at some trait of gentle goodness in the faulty
people who sit at the same hearth with me, or in the clergyman of
my own parish, who is perhaps rather too corpulent and in other
respects is not an Oberlin or a Tillotson, than at the deeds of
heroes whom I shall never know except by hearsay, or at the
sublimest abstract of all clerical graces that was ever conceived by
an able novelist.
And so I come back to Mr. Irwine, with whom I desire you to be
in perfect charity, far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) may be from satisfying your demands
on the clerical character. Perhaps you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) was not--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
ought to have been--a living demonstration of the benefits
attached to a national church? But I am not sure of that; at least I
know that the people in Broxton and Hayslope would have been
very sorry to part with their clergyman, and that most faces
brightened at his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) approach; and until it can be proved that hatred



<p/>238

<p/>is a better thing for the soul than love, I must believe that Mr.
Irwine's influence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) parish was a more wholesome one than
that of the zealous Mr. Ryde, who came there twenty years
afterwards, when Mr. Irwine had been gathered to his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) fathers. It is
true, Mr. Ryde insisted strongly on the doctrines of the
Reformation, visited his (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>) flock a great deal in their own homes, and
was severe in rebuking the aberrations of the flesh--put a stop,
indeed, to the Christmas rounds of the church singers, as
promoting drunkenness and too light a handling of sacred things.
But I gathered from Adam Bede, to whom I talked of these
matters in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) old age, that few clergymen could be less successful
in winning the hearts of their parishioners than Mr. Ryde. They
learned a great many notions about doctrine from him (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>), so that
almost every church-goer under fifty began to distinguish as well
between the genuine gospel and what did not come precisely up to
that standard, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>church-goer</b></font>) had been born and bred a Dissenter; and for
some time after his (<font color='blue'><b>church-goer</b></font>) arrival there seemed to be quite a religious
movement in that quiet rural district. <div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, ``I've seen
pretty clear, ever since I was a young un, as religion's something
else besides notions. It isn't notions sets people doing the right
thing--it's feelings. It's the same with the notions in religion as it
is with math'matics--a man may be able to work problems
straight off in 's head as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sits by the fire and smokes his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pipe, but
if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has to make a machine or a building, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must have a will and
a resolution and love something else better than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own ease.
Somehow, the congregation began to fall off, and people began to
speak light o' Mr. Ryde. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>) meant right at bottom; but,
you see, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>) was sourish-tempered, and was for beating down
prices with the people as worked for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>); and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>) preaching



<p/>239

<p/>wouldn't go down well with that sauce. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>) wanted to be like
my lord judge i' the parish, punishing folks for doing wrong; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>) scolded ’em from the pulpit as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>)'d been a Ranter, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>)
couldn't abide the Dissenters, and was a deal more set against ’em
than Mr. Irwine was. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) didn't keep within his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) income,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) seemed to think at first go-off that six hundred a-year was to
make him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) as big a man as Mr. Donnithorne. That's a sore mischief
I've often seen with the poor curates jumping into a bit of a living
all of a sudden. Mr. Ryde was a deal thought on at a distance, I
believe, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>) wrote books, but as for math'matics and the natur
o' things, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>) was as ignorant as a woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>) was very knowing
about doctrines, and used to call ’em the bulwarks of the
Reformation; but I've always mistrusted that sort o' learning as
leaves folks foolish and unreasonable about business. Now Mester
Irwine was as different as could be: as quick!--he (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>) understood
what you meant in a minute, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>) knew all about building, and
could see when you'd made a good job. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>) behaved as much
like a gentleman to the farmers, and th' old women, and the
labourers, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>) did to the gentry. You never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>) interfering
and scolding, and trying to play th' emperor. Ah, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>) was a fine
man as ever you set eyes on; and so kind to's mother and sisters.
That poor sickly Miss Anne--he (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>) seemed to think more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) than
of anybody else in the world. There wasn't a soul in the parish had
a word to say against him (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>); and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>) servants stayed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>) till
they were so old and pottering, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>) had to hire other folks to do
their work.''
``Well,'' I said, ``that was an excellent way of preaching in the
weekdays; but I daresay, if your old friend Mr. Irwine were to
come to life again, and get into the pulpit next Sunday, you would



<p/>240

<p/>be rather ashamed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) didn't preach better after all your
praise of him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>).''
``Nay, nay,'' said Adam, broadening his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) chest and throwing
himself back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) chair, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) were ready to meet all
inferences, ``nobody has ever heard me say Mr. Irwine was much
of a preacher. He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) didn't go into deep speritial experience; and I
know there s a deal in a man's inward life as you can't measure by
the square, and say, `Do this and that 'll follow,' and, `Do that and
this 'll follow.' There's things go on in the soul, and times when
feelings come into you like a rushing mighty wind, as the
Scripture says, and part your life in two a'most, so you look back
on yourself as if you was somebody else. Those are things as you
can't bottle up in a `do this' and `do that'; and I'll go so far with the
strongest Methodist ever you'll find. That shows me there's deep
speritial things in religion. You can't make much out wi' talking
about it, but you feel it. Mr. Irwine didn't go into those things--he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
preached short moral sermons, and that was all. But then he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) acted
pretty much up to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) said; he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) didn't set up for being so
different from other folks one day, and then be as like ’em as two
peas the next. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) made folks love him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) and respect him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>), and
that was better nor stirring up their gall wi' being over busy. Mrs.
Poyser used to say--you know she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) would have her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) word about
everything--she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) said, Mr. Irwine was like a good meal o' victual,
you were the better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) without thinking on it, and Mr. Ryde
was like a dose o' physic, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>) gripped you and worreted you, and
after all he (<font color='blue'><b>Ryde</b></font>) left you much the same.''
<div class="bookquote">``But didn't Mr. Ryde preach a great deal more about that
spiritual part of religion that you talk of, Adam? Couldn't you get
more out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) sermons than out of Mr. Irwine's?''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>241

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, I knowna. He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) preached a deal about doctrines. But I've
seen pretty clear, ever since I was a young un, as religion's
something else besides doctrines and notions. I look at it as if the
doctrines was like finding names for your feelings, so as you can
talk of ’em when you've never known ’em, just as a man may talk
o' tools when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows their names, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s never so much as
seen ’em, still less handled ’em. I've heard a deal o' doctrine i' my
time, for I used to go after the Dissenting preachers along wi' Seth,
when I was a lad o' seventeen, and got puzzling myself a deal
about th' Arminians and the Calvinists. The Wesleyans, you know,
are strong Arminians; and Seth, who could never abide anything
harsh and was always for hoping the best, held fast by the
Wesleyans from the very first; but I thought I could pick a hole or
two in their notions, and I got disputing wi' one o' the class leaders
down at Treddles'on, and harassed him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) so, first o' this side and
then o' that, till at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) said, `Young man, it's the devil making
use o' your pride and conceit as a weapon to war against the
simplicity o' the truth.' I couldn't help laughing then, but as I was
going home, I thought the man wasn't far wrong. I began to see as
all this weighing and sifting what this text means and that text
means, and whether folks are saved all by God's grace, or whether
there goes an ounce o' their own will to 't, was no part o' real
religion at all. You may talk o' these things for hours on end, and
you'll only be all the more coxy and conceited for 't. So I took to
going nowhere but to church, and hearing nobody but Mr. Irwine,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) said nothing but what was good and what you'd be the wiser
for remembering. And I found it better for my soul to be humble
before the mysteries o' God's dealings, and not be making a clatter
about what I could never understand. And they're poor foolish



<p/>242

<p/>questions after all; for what have we got either inside or outside of
us but what comes from God? If we've got a resolution to do right,
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) gave it us, I reckon, first or last; but I see plain enough we shall
never do it without a resolution, and that's enough for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Adam, you perceive, was a warm admirer, perhaps a partial
judge, of Mr. Irwine, as, happily, some of us still are of the people
we have known familiarly. Doubtless it will be despised as a
weakness by that lofty order of minds who pant after the ideal, and
are oppressed by a general sense that their emotions are of too
exquisite a character to find fit objects among their everyday
fellowmen. I have often been favoured with the confidence of
these select natures, and find them to concur in the experience
that great men are overestimated and small men are
insupportable; that if you would love a woman without ever
looking back on your love as a folly, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must die while you are
courting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and if you would maintain the slightest belief in
human heroism, you must never make a pilgrimage to see the
hero. I confess I have often meanly shrunk from confessing to
these accomplished and acute gentlemen what my own experience
has been. I am afraid I have often smiled with hypocritical assent,
and gratified them with an epigram on the fleeting nature of our
illusions, which any one moderately acquainted with French
literature can command at a moment's notice. Human converse, I
think some wise man has remarked, is not rigidly sincere. But I
herewith discharge my conscience, and declare that I have had
quite enthusiastic movements of admiration towards old
gentlemen who spoke the worst English, who were occasionally
fretful in their temper, and who had never moved in a higher
sphere of influence than that of parish overseer; and that the way



<p/>243

<p/>in which I have come to the conclusion that human nature is
lovable--the way I have learnt something of its deep pathos, its
sublime mysteries--has been by living a great deal among people
more or less commonplace and vulgar, of whom you would
perhaps hear nothing very surprising if you were to inquire about
them in the neighbourhoods where they dwelt. Ten to one most of
the small shopkeepers in their vicinity saw nothing at all in them.
For I have observed this remarkable coincidence, that the select
natures who pant after the ideal, and find nothing in pantaloons or
petticoats great enough to command their reverence and love, are
curiously in unison with the narrowest and pettiest. For example, I
have often heard Mr. Gedge, the landlord of the Royal Oak, who
used to turn a bloodshot eye on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) neighbours in the village of
Shepperton, sum up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) opinion of the people in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) own parish--
and they were all the people he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) knew--in these emphatic words:
<div class="bookquote">``Aye, sir, I've said it often, and I'll say it again, they're a poor lot i'
this parish--a poor lot, sir, big and little.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had a dim
idea that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) could migrate to a distant parish, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) might find
neighbours worthy of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>); and indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) did subsequently
transfer himself to the Saracen's Head, which was doing a thriving
business in the back street of a neighbouring market-town. But,
oddly enough, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) has found the people up that back street of
precisely the same stamp as the inhabitants of Shepperton--<div class="bookquote">``a
poor lot, sir, big and little, and them as comes for a go o' gin are no
better than them as comes for a pint o' twopenny--a poor lot.''




 (<font color='red'><b>the inhabitants</b></font>)</div><p/>244

<p/>Chapter XVIII
Church

<p/>``H

<p/>etty, Hetty, don't you know church begins at two,
and it's gone half after one a'ready? Have you got
nothing better to think on this good Sunday as poor
old Thias Bede's to be put into the ground, and him (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) drownded i'
th' dead o' the night, as it's enough to make one's back run cold,
but you must be 'dizening yourself as if there was a wedding i'stid
of a funeral?''
``Well, Aunt,'' said Hetty, <div class="bookquote">``I can't be ready so soon as everybody
else, when I've got Totty's things to put on. And I'd ever such work
to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) stand still.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>Hetty was coming downstairs, and Mrs. Poyser, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) plain
bonnet and shawl, was standing below. If ever a girl looked as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been made of roses, that girl was Hetty in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) Sunday hat
and frock. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hat was trimmed with pink, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) frock had
pink spots, sprinkled on a white ground. There was nothing but
pink and white about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), except in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) dark hair and eyes and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) little buckled shoes. Mrs. Poyser was provoked at herself, for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) could hardly keep from smiling, as any mortal is inclined to do
at the sight of pretty round things. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) turned without
speaking, and joined the group outside the house door, followed
by Hetty, whose heart was fluttering so at the thought of some one
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) expected to see at church that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hardly felt the ground she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
trod on.
And now the little procession set off. Mr. Poyser was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)



<p/>245

<p/>Sunday suit of drab, with a red-and-green waistcoat and a green
watch-ribbon having a large cornelian seal attached, pendant like
a plumb-line from that promontory where his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) watch-pocket was
situated; a silk handkerchief of a yellow tone round his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) neck; and
excellent grey ribbed stockings, knitted by Mrs. Poyser's own
hand, setting off the proportions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) leg. Mr. Poyser had no
reason to be ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) leg, and suspected that the growing
abuse of top-boots and other fashions tending to disguise the
nether limbs had their origin in a pitiable degeneracy of the
human calf. Still less had he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) reason to be ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) round
jolly face, which was good humour itself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Come,
Hetty--come, little uns!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) arm to his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) wife, led the
way through the causeway gate into the yard.
The <div class="bookquote">``little uns''  (<font color='red'><b>Marty</b></font>)</div>addressed were Marty and Tommy, boys of
nine and seven, in little fustian tailed coats and knee-breeches,
relieved by rosy cheeks and black eyes, looking as much like their
father as a very small elephant is like a very large one. Hetty
walked between them, and behind came patient Molly, whose task
it was to carry Totty through the yard and over all the wet places
on the road; for Totty, having speedily recovered from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
threatened fever, had insisted on going to church to-day, and
especially on wearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) red-and-black necklace outside her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
tippet. And there were many wet places for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to be carried over
this afternoon, for there had been heavy showers in the morning,
though now the clouds had rolled off and lay in towering silvery
masses on the horizon.
You might have known it was Sunday if you had only waked up
in the farmyard. The cocks and hens seemed to know it, and made
only crooning subdued noises; the very bull-dog looked less



<p/>246

<p/>savage, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would have been satisfied with a smaller bite than
usual. The sunshine seemed to call all things to rest and not to
labour. It was asleep itself on the moss-grown cow-shed; on the
group of white ducks nestling together with their bills tucked
under their wings; on the old black sow stretched languidly on the
straw, while her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) largest young one found an excellent spring-bed
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mother's fat ribs; on Alick, the shepherd, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) new smockfrock, taking an uneasy siesta, half-sitting, half-standing on the
granary steps. Alick was of opinion that church, like other
luxuries, was not to be indulged in often by a foreman who had the
weather and the ewes on his (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) mind. <div class="bookquote">``Church! Nay--I’n gotten
summat else to think on,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was an answer which he (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) often uttered in
a tone of bitter significance that silenced further question. I feel
sure Alick meant no irreverence; indeed, I know that his (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) mind was
not of a speculative, negative cast, and he (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) would on no account
have missed going to church on Christmas Day, Easter Sunday,
and <div class="bookquote">``Whissuntide.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) had a general impression that public
worship and religious ceremonies, like other non-productive
employments, were intended for people who had leisure.
<div class="bookquote">``There's Father a-standing at the yard-gate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin Poyser/Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin
Poyser. <div class="bookquote">``I reckon he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) wants to watch us down the field. It's
wonderful what sight he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) has, and him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) turned seventy-five.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I often think it's wi' th' old folks as it is wi' the babbies,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser; <div class="bookquote">``they're satisfied wi' looking, no matter what
they're looking at. It's God A’mighty's way o' quietening ’em, I
reckon, afore they go to sleep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>Old Martin opened the gate as he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) saw the family procession
approaching, and held it wide open, leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) stick--pleased
to do this bit of work; for, like all old men whose life has been



<p/>247

<p/>spent in labour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) liked to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was still useful--that there
was a better crop of onions in the garden because he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was by at the
sowing--and that the cows would be milked the better if he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) stayed
at home on a Sunday afternoon to look on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) always went to
church on Sacrament Sundays, but not very regularly at other
times; on wet Sundays, or whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had a touch of
rheumatism, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) used to read the three first chapters of Genesis
instead.
<div class="bookquote">``They'll ha' putten Thias Bede i' the ground afore ye get to the
churchyard,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) said, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) son came up. <div class="bookquote">``It 'ud ha' been better
luck if they'd ha' buried him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) i' the forenoon when the rain was
fallin'; there's no likelihoods of a drop now; an' the moon lies like a
boat there, dost see? That's a sure sign o' fair weather--there's a
many as is false but that's sure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye,''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>said the son, <div class="bookquote">``I'm in hopes it'll hold up now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mind what the parson says, mind what the parson says, my
lads,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)</div>said Grandfather to the black-eyed youngsters in kneebreeches, conscious of a marble or two in their pockets which they
looked forward to handling, a little, secretly, during the sermon.
<div class="bookquote">``Dood-bye, Dandad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Totty</b></font>)</div>said Totty. <div class="bookquote">``Me doin' to church. Me dot
my netlace on. Dive me a peppermint.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grandad</b></font>)</div>Grandad, shaking with laughter at this <div class="bookquote">``deep little wench,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grandad</b></font>)</div>slowly transferred his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandad</b></font>) stick to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandad</b></font>) left hand, which held the gate
open, and slowly thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandad</b></font>) finger into the waistcoat pocket on
which Totty had fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) eyes with a confident look of
expectation.
And when they were all gone, the old man leaned on the gate
again, watching them across the lane along the Home Close, and
through the far gate, till they disappeared behind a bend in the



<p/>248

<p/>hedge. For the hedgerows in those days shut out one's view, even
on the better-managed farms; and this afternoon, the dog-roses
were tossing out their pink wreaths, the nightshade was in its
yellow and purple glory, the pale honeysuckle grew out of reach,
peeping high up out of a holly bush, and over all an ash or a
sycamore every now and then threw its shadow across the path.
There were acquaintances at other gates who had to move aside
and let them pass: at the gate of the Home Close there was half the
dairy of cows standing one behind the other, extremely slow to
understand that their large bodies might be in the way; at the far
gate there was the mare holding her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) head over the bars, and
beside her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) the liver-coloured foal with its head towards its
mother's flank, apparently still much embarrassed by its own
straddling existence. The way lay entirely through Mr. Poyser's
own fields till they reached the main road leading to the village,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) turned a keen eye on the stock and the crops as they went
along, while Mrs. Poyser was ready to supply a running
commentary on them all. The woman who manages a dairy has a
large share in making the rent, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) may well be allowed to have
her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) opinion on stock and their <div class="bookquote">``keep'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--an exercise which
strengthens her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) understanding so much that she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) finds herself able
to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) husband advice on most other subjects.
<div class="bookquote">``There's that short-horned Sally,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) said, as they entered the
Home Close, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) caught sight of the meek beast that lay
chewing the cud and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) with a sleepy eye. <div class="bookquote">``I begin to
hate the sight o' the cow; and I say now what I said three weeks
ago, the sooner we get rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) the better, for there's that little
yallow cow as doesn't give half the milk, and yet I've twice as
much butter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>).''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>249

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, thee 't not like the women in general,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser;
<div class="bookquote">``they like the shorthorns, as give such a lot o' milk. There's
Chowne's wife wants him (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) to buy no other sort.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What's it sinnify what Chowne's wife likes? A poor soft thing,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, Chowne's been wanting to buy Sally, so we can get rid of

superior power of putting two and two together; indeed, on recent
market-days he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) had more than once boasted of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) discernment in
this very matter of shorthorns.
<div class="bookquote">``Aye, them as choose a soft for a wife may 's well buy up the

Poyser continued, as Totty, who had been set down now the road
was dry, toddled on in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) father and mother. <div class="bookquote">``There's

``Nay, nay,'' said Mr. Poyser, with rather a contemptuous
emphasis, ``thee dostna know the pints of a woman. The men 'ud
niver run after Dinah as they would after Hetty.''
``What care I what the men 'ud run after? It's well seen what

choice when I married thee,'' said Mr. Poyser, who usually settled
little conjugal disputes by a compliment of this sort; ``and thee
wast twice as buxom as Dinah ten year ago.''
<div class="bookquote">``I niver said as a woman had need to be ugly to make a good
missis of a house. There's Chowne's wife ugly enough to turn the
milk an' save the rennet, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'ll niver save nothing any other
way. But as for Dinah, poor child, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s niver likely to be buxom as
long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'ll make her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) dinner o' cake and water, for the sake o'
giving to them as want. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) provoked me past bearing sometimes;
and, as I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) went clean again' the Scriptur', for that says,
`Love your neighbour as yourself'; `but,' I said, `if you loved your
neighbour no better nor you do yourself, Dinah, it's little enough
you'd do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). You'd be thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) might do well enough on a

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, goodness me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser, who had looked back



<p/>252

<p/>while her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) husband was speaking, <div class="bookquote">``look where Molly is with them
lads! They're the field's length behind us. How could you let ’em
do so, Hetty? Anybody might as well set a pictur' to watch the
children as you. Run back and tell ’em to come on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>Mr. and Mrs. Poyser were now at the end of the second field, so
they set Totty on the top of one of the large stones forming the
true Loamshire stile, and awaited the loiterers Totty observing
with complacency, <div class="bookquote">``Dey naughty, naughty boys--me dood.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Totty</b></font>)</div>The fact was that this Sunday walk through the fields was
fraught with great excitement to Marty and Tommy, who saw a
perpetual drama going on in the hedgerows, and could no more
refrain from stopping and peeping than if they had been a couple
of spaniels or terriers. Marty was quite sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Marty</b></font>) saw a yellowhammer on the boughs of the great ash, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Marty</b></font>) was peeping,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Marty</b></font>) missed the sight of a white-throated stoat, which had run across
the path and was described with much fervour by the junior
Tommy. Then there was a little greenfinch, just fledged, fluttering
along the ground, and it seemed quite possible to catch it, till it
managed to flutter under the blackberry bush. Hetty could not be
got to give any heed to these things, so Molly was called on for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
ready sympathy, and peeped with open mouth wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was
told, and said <div class="bookquote">``Lawks!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was expected to wonder.
Molly hastened on with some alarm when Hetty had come back
and called to them that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt was angry; but Marty ran on first,
shouting, <div class="bookquote">``We've found the speckled turkey's nest, Mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marty</b></font>)</div>with
the instinctive confidence that people who bring good news are
never in fault.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser, really forgetting all discipline in this
pleasant surprise, <div class="bookquote">``that's a good lad; why, where is it?''



 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div><p/>253

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Down in ever such a hole, under the hedge. I saw it first,
looking after the greenfinch, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) sat on th' nest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I went away as still as still, and whispered to Molly--didn't
I, Molly?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, now come on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser, <div class="bookquote">``and walk before

must go straight on now. Good boys don't look after the birds of a
Sunday.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But, Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marty</b></font>)</div>said Marty, <div class="bookquote">``you said you'd give half-a-crown to

into my money-box?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marty</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We'll see about that, my lad, if you walk along now, like a good
boy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The father mother</b></font>)</div>The father and mother exchanged a significant glance of
amusement at their eldest-born's acuteness; but on Tommy's
round face there was a cloud.
<div class="bookquote">``Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) said, half-crying, <div class="bookquote">``Marty's got ever so much more
money in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marty</b></font>) box nor I've got in mine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Munny, me want half-a-toun in my bots,''  (<font color='red'><b>Totty</b></font>)</div>said Totty.
<div class="bookquote">``Hush, hush, hush,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser, <div class="bookquote">``did ever anybody hear
such naughty children? Nobody shall ever see their money-boxes
any more, if they don't make haste and go on to church.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>This dreadful threat had the desired effect, and through the two
remaining fields the three pair of small legs trotted on without any
serious interruption, notwithstanding a small pond full of tadpoles,
alias <div class="bookquote">``bullheads,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lads</b></font>)</div>which the lads looked at wistfully.



<p/>254

<p/>morrow was not a cheering sight to Mr. Poyser, who during hay
and corn harvest had often some mental struggles as to the
benefits of a day of rest; but no temptation would have induced
him (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) to carry on any field-work, however early in the morning, on a
Sunday; for had not Michael Holdsworth had a pair of oxen
<div class="bookquote">``sweltered''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael</b></font>)</div>while he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) was ploughing on Good Friday? That was a
demonstration that work on sacred days was a wicked thing; and
with wickedness of any sort Martin Poyser was quite clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
would have nothing to do, since money got by such means would
never prosper.
<div class="bookquote">``It a'most makes your fingers itch to be at the hay now the sun
shines so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) observed, as they passed through the <div class="bookquote">``Big
Meadow.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But it's poor foolishness to think o' saving by going
against your conscience. There's that Jim Wakefield, as they used
to call `Gentleman Wakefield,' used to do the same of a Sunday as
o' week-days, and took no heed to right or wrong, as if there was
nayther God nor devil. An' what's he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) come to? Why, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
myself last market-day a-carrying a basket wi' oranges in 't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser, emphatically, <div class="bookquote">``you make but
a poor trap to catch luck if you go and bait it wi' wickedness. The
money as is got so's like to burn holes i' your pocket. I'd niver wish
us to leave our lads a sixpence but what was got i' the rightful way.
And as for the weather, there's One above makes it, and we must
put up wi't: it's nothing of a plague to what the wenches are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>Notwithstanding the interruption in their walk, the excellent
habit which Mrs. Poyser's clock had of taking time by the forelock
had secured their arrival at the village while it was still a quarter
to two, though almost every one who meant to go to church was
already within the churchyard gates. Those who stayed at home



<p/>255

<p/>were chiefly mothers, like Timothy's Bess, who stood at her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) own
door nursing her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) baby and feeling as women feel in that position--
that nothing else can be expected of them.
It was not entirely to see Thias Bede's funeral that the people
were standing about the churchyard so long before service began;
that was their common practice. The women, indeed, usually
entered the church at once, and the farmers' wives talked in an
undertone to each other, over the tall pews, about their illnesses
and the total failure of doctor's stuff, recommending dandeliontea, and other home-made specifics, as far preferable--about the
servants, and their growing exorbitance as to wages, whereas the
quality of their services declined from year to year, and there was
no girl nowadays to be trusted any further than you could see
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)--about the bad price Mr. Dingall, the Treddleston grocer, was
giving for butter, and the reasonable doubts that might be held as
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) solvency, notwithstanding that Mrs. Dingall was a sensible
woman, and they were all sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had very good kin.
Meantime the men lingered outside, and hardly any of them
except the singers, who had a humming and fragmentary
rehearsal to go through, entered the church until Mr. Irwine was
in the desk. They saw no reason for that premature entrance--
what could they do in church if they were there before service
began?--and they did not conceive that any power in the universe
could take it ill of them if they stayed out and talked a little about
<div class="bookquote">``bis’ness.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chad Cranage/Chad</b></font>)</div>Chad Cranage looks like quite a new acquaintance to-day, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cranage</b></font>) has got his (<font color='blue'><b>Cranage</b></font>) clean Sunday face, which always makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Cranage</b></font>) little
granddaughter cry at him (<font color='blue'><b>Cranage</b></font>) as a stranger. But an experienced eye
would have fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Cranage</b></font>) at once as the village blacksmith, after



<p/>256

<p/>seeing the humble deference with which the big saucy fellow took
off his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hat and stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hair to the farmers; for Chad was
accustomed to say that a working-man must hold a candle to a
personage understood to be as black as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was himself on
weekdays; by which evil-sounding rule of conduct he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) meant what
was, after all, rather virtuous than otherwise, namely, that men
who had horses to be shod must be treated with respect. Chad and
the rougher sort of workmen kept aloof from the grave under the
white thorn, where the burial was going forward; but Sandy Jim,
and several of the farm-labourers, made a group round it, and
stood with their hats off, as fellow-mourners with the mother and
sons. Others held a midway position, sometimes watching the
group at the grave, sometimes listening to the conversation of the
farmers, who stood in a knot near the church door, and were now
joined by Martin Poyser, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) family passed into the church.
On the outside of this knot stood Mr. Casson, the landlord of the
Donnithorne Arms, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) most striking attitude--that is to say,
with the forefinger of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) right hand thrust between the buttons of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) waistcoat, his (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) left hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) breeches pocket, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) head
very much on one side; looking, on the whole, like an actor who
has only a mono-syllabic part entrusted to him (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>), but feels sure that
the audience discern his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) fitness for the leading business; curiously
in contrast with old Jonathan Burge, who held his (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) hands behind
him (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) and leaned forward, coughing asthmatically, with an inward
scorn of all knowingness that could not be turned into cash. The
talk was in rather a lower tone than usual to-day, hushed a little by
the sound of Mr. Irwine's voice reading the final prayers of the
burial-service. They had all had their word of pity for poor Thias,
but now they had got upon the nearer subject of their own



<p/>257

<p/>grievances against Satchell, the Squire's bailiff, who played the
part of steward so far as it was not performed by old Mr.
Donnithorne himself, for that gentleman had the meanness to
receive his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) own rents and make bargains about his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) own timber.
This subject of conversation was an additional reason for not
being loud, since Satchell himself might presently be walking up
the paved road to the church door. And soon they became
suddenly silent; for Mr. Irwine's voice had ceased, and the group
round the white thorn was dispersing itself towards the church.
They all moved aside, and stood with their hats off, while Mr.
Irwine passed. Adam and Seth were coming next, with their
mother between them; for Joshua Rann officiated as head sexton
as well as clerk, and was not yet ready to follow the rector into the
vestry. But there was a pause before the three mourners came on:
Lisbeth had turned round to look again towards the grave! Ah!
There was nothing now but the brown earth under the white
thorn. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) cried less to-day than she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) had done any day since
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) husband's death. Along with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) grief there was mixed an
unusual sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) own importance in having a <div class="bookquote">``burial,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div>and in
Mr. Irwine's reading a special service for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) husband; and
besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) knew the funeral psalm was going to be sung for him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) felt this counter-excitement to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) sorrow still more strongly
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) walked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) sons towards the church door, and saw the
friendly sympathetic nods of their fellow-parishioners.
The mother and sons passed into the church, and one by one
the loiterers followed, though some still lingered without; the sight
of Mr. Donnithorne's carriage, which was winding slowly up the
hill, perhaps helping to make them feel that there was no need for
haste.



<p/>258

<p/>But presently the sound of the bassoon and the key-bugles
burst forth; the evening hymn, which always opened the service,
had begun, and every one must now enter and take his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) place.
I cannot say that the interior of Hayslope Church was
remarkable for anything except for the grey age of its oaken
pews--great square pews mostly, ranged on each side of a narrow
aisle. It was free, indeed, from the modern blemish of galleries.
The choir had two narrow pews to themselves in the middle of the
right-hand row, so that it was a short process for Joshua Rann to
take his (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) place among them as principal bass, and return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>)
desk after the singing was over. The pulpit and desk, grey and old
as the pews, stood on one side of the arch leading into the chancel,
which also had its grey square pews for Mr. Donnithorne's family
and servants. Yet I assure you these grey pews, with the buffwashed walls, gave a very pleasing tone to this shabby interior,
and agreed extremely well with the ruddy faces and bright
waistcoats. And there were liberal touches of crimson toward the
chancel, for the pulpit and Mr. Donnithorne's own pew had
handsome crimson cloth cushions; and, to close the vista, there
was a crimson altar-cloth, embroidered with golden rays by Miss
Lydia's own hand.
But even without the crimson cloth, the effect must have been
warm and cheering when Mr. Irwine was in the desk, looking
benignly round on that simple congregation--on the hardy old
men, with bent knees and shoulders, perhaps, but with vigour left
for much hedge-clipping and thatching; on the tall stalwart frames
and roughly cut bronzed faces of the stone-cutters and carpenters;
on the half-dozen well-to-do farmers, with their apple-cheeked
families; and on the clean old women, mostly farm-labourers'



<p/>259

<p/>wives, with their bit of snow-white cap-border under their black
bonnets, and with their withered arms, bare from the elbow,
folded passively over their chests. For none of the old people held
books--why should they? Not one of them could read. But they
knew a few <div class="bookquote">``good words''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>by heart, and their withered lips now
and then moved silently, following the service without any very
clear comprehension indeed, but with a simple faith in its efficacy
to ward off harm and bring blessing. And now all faces were
visible, for all were standing up--the little children on the seats
peeping over the edge of the grey pews, while good Bishop Ken's
evening hymn was being sung to one of those lively psalm-tunes
which died out with the last generation of rectors and choral
parish clerks. Melodies die out, like the pipe of Pan, with the ears
that love them and listen for them. Adam was not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) usual
place among the singers to-day, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother and
Seth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) noticed with surprise that Bartle Massey was absent
too--all the more agreeable for Mr. Joshua Rann, who gave out his (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>)
bass notes with unusual complacency and threw an extra ray of
severity into the glances he (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) sent over his (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) spectacles at the recusant
Will Maskery.
I beseech you to imagine Mr. Irwine looking round on this
scene, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) ample white surplice that became him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) so well, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) powdered hair thrown back, his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) rich brown complexion, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) finely cut nostril and upper lip; for there was a certain virtue in
that benignant yet keen countenance as there is in all human faces
from which a generous soul beams out. And over all streamed the
delicious June sunshine through the old windows, with their
desultory patches of yellow, red, and blue, that threw pleasant
touches of colour on the opposite wall.



<p/>260

<p/>I think, as Mr. Irwine looked round to-day, his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) eyes rested an
instant longer than usual on the square pew occupied by Martin
Poyser and his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) family. And there was another pair of dark eyes
that found it impossible not to wander thither, and rest on that
round pink-and-white figure. But Hetty was at that moment quite
careless of any glances--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was absorbed in the thought that
Arthur Donnithorne would soon be coming into church, for the
carriage must surely be at the church-gate by this time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had
never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) since she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) parted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) in the wood on
Thursday evening, and oh, how long the time had seemed! Things
had gone on just the same as ever since that evening; the wonders
that had happened then had brought no changes after them; they
were already like a dream. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heard the church door
swinging, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heart beat so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) dared not look up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt was curtsying; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) curtsied herself. That must be old Mr.
Donnithorne--he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) always came first, the wrinkled small old man,
peering round with short-sighted glances at the bowing and
curtsying congregation; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knew Miss Lydia was passing,
and though Hetty liked so much to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) fashionable little
coal-scuttle bonnet, with the wreath of small roses round it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
didn't mind it to-day. But there were no more curtsies--no, he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) was
not come; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt sure there was nothing else passing the pew
door but the house-keeper's black bonnet and the lady's maid's
beautiful straw hat that had once been Miss Lydia's, and then the
powdered heads of the butler and footman. No, he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) was not there;
yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) would look now--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) might be mistaken--for, after all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
had not looked. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) eyelids and glanced timidly at
the cushioned pew in the chancel--there was no one but old Mr.
Donnithorne rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) spectacles with his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) white handkerchief,



<p/>261

<p/>and Miss Lydia opening the large gilt-edged prayer-book. The chill
disappointment was too hard to bear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) felt herself turning pale,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) lips trembling; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was ready to cry. Oh, what should she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) do?
Everybody would know the reason; they would know she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was
crying because Arthur was not there. And Mr. Craig, with the
wonderful hothouse plant in his (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) button-hole, was staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>),
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) knew. It was dreadfully long before the General Confession
began, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) could kneel down. Two great drops would fall
then, but no one saw them except good-natured Molly, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
aunt and uncle knelt with their backs towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). Molly, unable
to imagine any cause for tears in church except faintness, of which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had a vague traditional knowledge, drew out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pocket a
queer little flat blue smelling-bottle, and after much labour in
pulling the cork out, thrust the narrow neck against Hetty's
nostrils. <div class="bookquote">``It donna smell,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) whispered, thinking this was a great
advantage which old salts had over fresh ones: they did you good
without biting your nose. Hetty pushed it away peevishly; but this
little flash of temper did what the salts could not have done--it
roused her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to wipe away the traces of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) tears, and try with all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) might not to shed any more. Hetty had a certain strength in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) vain little nature: she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would have borne anything rather than
be laughed at, or pointed at with any other feeling than
admiration; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would have pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) own nails into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) tender
flesh rather than people should know a secret she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) did not want
them to know.
What fluctuations there were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) busy thoughts and feelings,
while Mr. Irwine was pronouncing the solemn <div class="bookquote">``Absolution''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div>in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
deaf ears, and through all the tones of petition that followed!
Anger lay very close to disappointment, and soon won the victory



<p/>262

<p/>over the conjectures her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) small ingenuity could devise to account
for Arthur's absence on the supposition that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) really wanted to
come, really wanted to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) again. And by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) rose
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knees mechanically, because all the rest were rising, the
colour had returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cheeks even with a heightened glow,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was framing little indignant speeches to herself, saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
hated Arthur for giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) this pain--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would like him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to suffer
too. Yet while this selfish tumult was going on in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) soul, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eyes
were bent down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) prayer-book, and the eyelids with their
dark fringe looked as lovely as ever. Adam Bede thought so, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>)
glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) for a moment on rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) knees.
But Adam's thoughts of Hetty did not deafen him (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) to the service;
they rather blended with all the other deep feelings for which the
church service was a channel to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) this afternoon, as a certain
consciousness of our entire past and our imagined future blends
itself with all our moments of keen sensibility. And to Adam the
church service was the best channel he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could have found for his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
mingled regret, yearning, and resignation; its interchange of
beseeching cries for help with outbursts of faith and praise, its
recurrent responses and the familiar rhythm of its collects,
seemed to speak for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) as no other form of worship could have
done; as, to those early Christians who had worshipped from their
childhood upwards in catacombs, the torch-light and shadows
must have seemed nearer the Divine presence than the heathenish
daylight of the streets. The secret of our emotions never lies in the
bare object, but in its subtle relations to our own past: no wonder
the secret escapes the unsympathising observer, who might as
well put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) spectacles to discern odours.
But there was one reason why even a chance comer would have



<p/>263

<p/>found the service in Hayslope Church more impressive than in
most other village nooks in the kingdom--a reason of which I am
sure you have not the slightest suspicion. It was the reading of our
friend Joshua Rann. Where that good shoemaker got his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) notion of
reading from remained a mystery even to his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) most intimate
acquaintances. I believe, after all, he (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) got it chiefly from Nature,
who had poured some of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) music into this honest conceited soul,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had been known to do into other narrow souls before his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>), at least, a fine bass voice and a musical ear;
but I cannot positively say whether these alone had sufficed to
inspire him (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) with the rich chant in which he (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) delivered the
responses. The way he (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) rolled from a rich deep forte into a
melancholy cadence, subsiding, at the end of the last word, into a
sort of faint resonance, like the lingering vibrations of a fine
violoncello, I can compare to nothing for its strong calm
melancholy but the rush and cadence of the wind among the
autumn boughs. This may seem a strange mode of speaking about
the reading of a parish clerk--a man in rusty spectacles, with
stubbly hair, a large occiput, and a prominent crown. But that is
Nature's way: she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) will allow a gentleman of splendid physiognomy
and poetic aspirations to sing woefully out of tune, and not give
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) the slightest hint of it; and takes care that some narrowbrowed fellow, trolling a ballad in the corner of a pot-house, shall
be as true to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) intervals as a bird.
Joshua himself was less proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>) reading than of his (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>)
singing, and it was always with a sense of heightened importance
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>) passed from the desk to the choir. Still more to-day: it was
a special occasion, for an old man, familiar to all the parish, had
died a sad death--not in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bed, a circumstance the most painful



<p/>264

<p/>to the mind of the peasant--and now the funeral psalm was to be
sung in memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sudden departure. Moreover, Bartle
Massey was not at church, and Joshua's importance in the choir
suffered no eclipse. It was a solemn minor strain they sang. The
old psalm-tunes have many a wail among them, and the words--
Thou sweep'st us off as with a flood;
We vanish hence like dreams--
seemed to have a closer application than usual in the death of poor
Thias. The mother and sons listened, each with peculiar feelings.
Lisbeth had a vague belief that the psalm was doing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) husband
good; it was part of that decent burial which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) would have
thought it a greater wrong to withhold from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) than to have
caused him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) many unhappy days while he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was living. The more
there was said about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) husband, the more there was done for
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), surely the safer he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would be. It was poor Lisbeth's blind way
of feeling that human love and pity are a ground of faith in some
other love. Seth, who was easily touched, shed tears, and tried to
recall, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had done continually since his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) father's death, all that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had heard of the possibility that a single moment of
consciousness at the last might be a moment of pardon and
reconcilement; for was it not written in the very psalm they were
singing that the Divine dealings were not measured and
circumscribed by time? Adam had never been unable to join in a
psalm before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had known plenty of trouble and vexation since
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had been a lad, but this was the first sorrow that had hemmed
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) voice, and strangely enough it was sorrow because the chief
source of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) past trouble and vexation was for ever gone out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)



<p/>265

<p/>reach. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had not been able to press his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father's hand before their
parting, and say, <div class="bookquote">``Father, you know it was all right between us; I
never forgot what I owed you when I was a lad; you forgive me if I
have been too hot and hasty now and then!''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>Adam thought but
little to-day of the hard work and the earnings he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had spent on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
father: his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thoughts ran constantly on what the old man's feelings
had been in moments of humiliation, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had held down his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
head before the rebukes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) son. When our indignation is borne
in submissive silence, we are apt to feel twinges of doubt
afterwards as to our own generosity, if not justice; how much more
when the object of our anger has gone into everlasting silence, and
we have seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) face for the last time in the meekness of death!
<div class="bookquote">``Ah! I was always too hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam said to himself. ``It's a sore
fault in me as I'm so hot and out o' patience with people when they
do wrong, and my heart gets shut up against ’em, so as I can't
bring myself to forgive ’em. I see clear enough there's more pride
nor love in my soul, for I could sooner make a thousand strokes
with th' hammer for my father than bring myself to say a kind
word to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). And there went plenty o' pride and temper to the
strokes, as the devil will be having his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) finger in what we call our
duties as well as our sins. Mayhap the best thing I ever did in my
life was only doing what was easiest for myself. It's allays been
easier for me to work nor to sit still, but the real tough job for me
'ud be to master my own will and temper and go right against my
own pride. It seems to me now, if I was to find Father at home tonight, I should behave different; but there's no knowing--perhaps
nothing 'ud be a lesson to us if it didn't come too late. It's well we
should feel as life's a reckoning we can't make twice over; there's
no real making amends in this world, any more nor you can mend



<p/>266

<p/>a wrong subtraction by doing your addition right.''
This was the key-note to which Adam's thoughts had
perpetually returned since his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father's death, and the solemn wail
of the funeral psalm was only an influence that brought back the
old thoughts with stronger emphasis. So was the sermon, which
Mr. Irwine had chosen with reference to Thias's funeral. It spoke
briefly and simply of the words, ``In the midst of life we are in
death''--how the present moment is all we can call our own for
works of mercy, of righteous dealing, and of family tenderness. All
very old truths--but what we thought the oldest truth becomes the
most startling to us in the week when we have looked on the dead
face of one who has made a part of our own lives. For when men
want to impress us with the effect of a new and wonderfully vivid
light, do they not let it fall on the most familiar objects, that we
may measure its intensity by remembering the former dimness?
Then came the moment of the final blessing, when the forever
sublime words, <div class="bookquote">``The peace of God, which passeth all
understanding,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>seemed to blend with the calm afternoon
sunshine that fell on the bowed heads of the congregation; and
then the quiet rising, the mothers tying on the bonnets of the little
maidens who had slept through the sermon, the fathers collecting
the prayer-books, until all streamed out through the old archway
into the green churchyard and began their neighbourly talk, their
simple civilities, and their invitations to tea; for on a Sunday every
one was ready to receive a guest--it was the day when all must be
in their best clothes and their best humour.
Mr. and Mrs. Poyser paused a minute at the church gate: they
were waiting for Adam to come up, not being contented to go away
without saying a kind word to the widow and her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) sons.



<p/>267

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mrs. Bede,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser, as they walked on
together, <div class="bookquote">``you must keep up your heart; husbands and wives must
be content when they've lived to rear their children and see one
another's hair grey.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser; <div class="bookquote">``they wonna have long to wait for
one another then, anyhow. And ye've got two o' the strapping'st
sons i' th' country; and well you may, for I remember poor Thias
as fine a broad-shouldered fellow as need to be; and as for you,
Mrs. Bede, why you're straighter i' the back nor half the young
women now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Eh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Lisbeth, <div class="bookquote">``it's poor luck for the platter to wear well
when it's broke i' two. The sooner I'm laid under the thorn the
better. I'm no good to nobody now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam never took notice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother's little unjust plaints; but
Seth said, <div class="bookquote">``Nay, Mother, thee mustna say so. Thy sons 'ull never
get another mother.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's true, lad, that's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser; <div class="bookquote">``and it's wrong
on us to give way to grief, Mrs. Bede; for it's like the children
cryin' when the fathers and mothers take things from ’em. There's
One above knows better nor us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser, <div class="bookquote">``an' it's poor work allays settin' the
dead above the livin'. We shall all on us be dead some time, I
reckon--it 'ud be better if folks 'ud make much on us beforehand,
i'stid o' beginnin' when we're gone. It's but little good you'll do awatering the last year's crop.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, Adam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser, feeling that his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) wife's words
were, as usual, rather incisive than soothing, and that it would be
well to change the subject, ``you'll come and see us again now, I
hope. I hanna had a talk with you this long while, and the missis



<p/>268

<p/>here wants you to see what can be done with her (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) best spinningwheel, for it's got broke, and it'll be a nice job to mend it--there'll
want a bit o' turning. You'll come as soon as you can now, will
you?''
Mr. Poyser paused and looked round while he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was speaking, as
if to see where Hetty was; for the children were running on before.
Hetty was not without a companion, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had, besides, more
pink and white about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) than ever, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) held in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hand the
wonderful pink-and-white hot-house plant, with a very long
name--a Scotch name, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) supposed, since people said Mr. Craig
the gardener was Scotch. Adam took the opportunity of looking
round too; and I am sure you will not require of him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) should
feel any vexation in observing a pouting expression on Hetty's face
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) listened to the gardener's small talk. Yet in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) secret heart
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was glad to have him (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) side, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would perhaps learn
from him (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) how it was Arthur had not come to church. Not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
cared to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) the question, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hoped the information
would be given spontaneously; for Mr. Craig, like a superior man,
was very fond of giving information.
Mr. Craig was never aware that his (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) conversation and advances
were received coldly, for to shift one's point of view beyond certain
limits is impossible to the most liberal and expansive mind; we are
none of us aware of the impression we produce on Brazilian
monkeys of feeble understanding--it is possible they see hardly
anything in us. Moreover, Mr. Craig was a man of sober passions,
and was already in his (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) tenth year of hesitation as to the relative
advantages of matrimony and bachelorhood. It is true that, now
and then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) had been a little heated by an extra glass of
grog, he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) had been heard to say of Hetty that the ``lass was well



<p/>269

<p/>enough,'' and that ``a man might do worse''; but on convivial
occasions men are apt to express themselves strongly.
Martin Poyser held Mr. Craig in honour, as a man who ``knew
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) business'' and who had great lights concerning soils and
compost; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was less of a favourite with Mrs. Poyser, who had
more than once said in confidence to her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) husband, ``You're mighty
fond o' Craig, but for my part, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>)'s welly like a cock as
thinks the sun's rose o' purpose to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) crow.'' For the rest,
Mr. Craig was an estimable gardener, and was not without reasons
for having a high opinion of himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) had also high shoulders
and high cheek-bones and hung his (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) head forward a little, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>)
walked along with his (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) breeches pockets. I think it was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) pedigree only that had the advantage of being Scotch, and not
his (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) ``bringing up''; for except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) had a stronger burr in his (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>)
accent, his (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) speech differed little from that of the Loamshire people
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>). But a gardener is Scotch, as a French teacher is
Parisian.
``Well, Mr. Poyser,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) said, before the good slow farmer had
time to speak, ``ye'll not be carrying your hay to-morrow, I'm
thinking. The glass sticks at `change,' and ye may rely upo' my
word as we'll ha' more downfall afore twenty-four hours is past. Ye
see that darkish-blue cloud there upo' the 'rizon--ye know what I
mean by the 'rizon, where the land and sky seems to meet?''
``Aye, aye, I see the cloud,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mr. Poyser, ``'rizon or no 'rizon.
It's right o’er Mike Holdsworth's fallow, and a foul fallow it is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>``Well, you mark my words, as that cloud 'ull spread o’er the sky
pretty nigh as quick as you'd spread a tarpaulin over one o' your
hay-ricks. It's a great thing to ha' studied the look o' the clouds.
Lord bless you! Th' met'orological almanecks can learn me



<p/>270

<p/>nothing, but there's a pretty sight o' things I could let them up to, if
they'd just come to me. And how are you, Mrs. Poyser?--thinking
o' getherin' the red currants soon, I reckon. You'd a deal better
gether ’em afore they're o’erripe, wi' such weather as we've got to
look forward to. How do ye do, Mistress Bede?'' Mr. Craig
continued, without a pause, nodding by the way to Adam and
Seth. ``I hope y' enjoyed them spinach and gooseberries as I sent
Chester with th' other day. If ye want vegetables while ye're in
trouble, ye know where to come to. It's well known I'm not giving
other folks' things away, for when I've supplied the house, the
garden s my own spekilation, and it isna every man th' old squire
could get as 'ud be equil to the undertaking, let alone asking
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>)'d be willing I've got to run my calkilation fine, I can
tell you, to make sure o' getting back the money as I pay the
squire. I should like to see some o' them fellows as make the
almanecks looking as far before their noses as I've got to do every
year as comes.''
``They look pretty fur, though,'' said Mr. Poyser, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
head on one side and speaking in rather a subdued reverential
tone. ``Why, what could come truer nor that pictur o' the cock wi'
the big spurs, as has got its head knocked down wi' th' anchor, an'
th' firin', an' the ships behind? Why, that pictur was made afore
Christmas, and yit it's come as true as th' Bible. Why, th' cock's
France, an' th' anchor's Nelson--an' they told us that
beforehand.''
``Pee--ee-eh!'' said Mr. Craig. ``A man doesna want to see fur to
know as th' English 'ull beat the French. Why, I know upo' good
authority as it's a big Frenchman as reaches five foot high, an'
they live upo' spoon-meat mostly. I knew a man as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father had a



<p/>271

<p/>particular knowledge o' the French. I should like to know what
them grasshoppers are to do against such fine fellows as our
young Captain Arthur. Why, it 'ud astonish a Frenchman only to
look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) arm's thicker nor a Frenchman's body, I'll be
bound, for they pinch theirsells in wi' stays; and it's easy enough,
for they've got nothing i' their insides.''
``Where IS the captain, as he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) wasna at church to-day?'' said
Adam. ``I was talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) o' Friday, and he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) said nothing about
his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) going away.''
``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'s only gone to Eagledale for a bit o' fishing; I reckon
he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'ll be back again afore many days are o’er, for he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'s to be at all th'
arranging and preparing o' things for the comin' o' age o' the 30th
o' July. But he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'s fond o' getting away for a bit, now and then. Him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)
and th' old squire fit one another like frost and flowers.''
Mr. Craig smiled and winked slowly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) made this last
observation, but the subject was not developed farther, for now
they had reached the turning in the road where Adam and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
companions must say ``good-bye.'' The gardener, too, would have
had to turn off in the same direction if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had not accepted Mr.
Poyser's invitation to tea. Mrs. Poyser duly seconded the
invitation, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) would have held it a deep disgrace not to make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) neighbours welcome to her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) house: personal likes and dislikes
must not interfere with that sacred custom. Moreover, Mr. Craig
had always been full of civilities to the family at the Hall Farm,
and Mrs. Poyser was scrupulous in declaring that she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) had
<div class="bookquote">``nothing to say again' him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>), on'y it was a pity he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) couldna be
hatched o’er again, an' hatched different.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>So Adam and Seth, with their mother between them, wound
their way down to the valley and up again to the old house, where



<p/>272

<p/>a saddened memory had taken the place of a long, long anxiety--
where Adam would never have to ask again as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) entered,
<div class="bookquote">``Where's Father?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And the other family party, with Mr. Craig for company, went
back to the pleasant bright house-place at the Hall Farm--all with
quiet minds, except Hetty, who knew now where Arthur was gone,
but was only the more puzzled and uneasy. For it appeared that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) absence was quite voluntary; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) need not have gone--he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
would not have gone if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had wanted to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had a
sickening sense that no lot could ever be pleasant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) again if
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) Thursday night's vision was not to be fulfilled; and in this
moment of chill, bare, wintry disappointment and doubt, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
looked towards the possibility of being with Arthur again, of
meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) loving glance, and hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) soft words with that
eager yearning which one may call the <div class="bookquote">``growing pain''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>of passion.




<p/>273

<p/>Chapter XIX
Adam on a Working Day

<p/>N

<p/>otwithstanding Mr. Craig's prophecy, the dark-blue cloud
dispersed itself without having produced the threatened
consequences. <div class="bookquote">``The weather'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) observed the next
morning--<div class="bookquote">``the weather, you see, 's a ticklish thing, an' a fool 'ull
hit on 't sometimes when a wise man misses; that's why the
almanecks get so much credit. It's one o' them chancy things as
fools thrive on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This unreasonable behaviour of the weather, however, could
displease no one else in Hayslope besides Mr. Craig. All hands
were to be out in the meadows this morning as soon as the dew
had risen; the wives and daughters did double work in every
farmhouse, that the maids might give their help in tossing the hay;
and when Adam was marching along the lanes, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) basket of
tools over his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) shoulder, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) caught the sound of jocose talk and
ringing laughter from behind the hedges. The jocose talk of haymakers is best at a distance; like those clumsy bells round the
cows' necks, it has rather a coarse sound when it comes close, and
may even grate on your ears painfully; but heard from far off, it
mingles very prettily with the other joyous sounds of nature.
Men's muscles move better when their souls are making merry
music, though their merriment is of a poor blundering sort, not at
all like the merriment of birds.
And perhaps there is no time in a summer's day more cheering
than when the warmth of the sun is just beginning to triumph over



<p/>274

<p/>the freshness of the morning--when there is just a lingering hint
of early coolness to keep off languor under the delicious influence
of warmth. The reason Adam was walking along the lanes at this
time was because his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) work for the rest of the day lay at a countryhouse about three miles off, which was being put in repair for the
son of a neighbouring squire; and he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) had been busy since early
morning with the packing of panels, doors, and chimney-pieces, in
a waggon which was now gone on before him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>), while Jonathan
Burge himself had ridden to the spot on horseback, to await its
arrival and direct the workmen.
This little walk was a rest to Adam, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was unconsciously
under the charm of the moment. It was summer morning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
heart, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) saw Hetty in the sunshine--a sunshine without
glare, with slanting rays that tremble between the delicate
shadows of the leaves. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought, yesterday when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) as they came out of church, that there was a touch of
melancholy kindness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) face, such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had not seen before,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) took it as a sign that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had some sympathy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
family trouble. Poor fellow! That touch of melancholy came from
quite another source, but how was he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to know? We look at the one
little woman's face we love as we look at the face of our mother
earth, and see all sorts of answers to our own yearnings. It was
impossible for Adam not to feel that what had happened in the last
week had brought the prospect of marriage nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>).
Hitherto he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had felt keenly the danger that some other man might
step in and get possession of Hetty's heart and hand, while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
himself was still in a position that made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shrink from asking
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to accept him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Even if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had had a strong hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was
fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hope was far from being strong--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had



<p/>275

<p/>been too heavily burdened with other claims to provide a home for
himself and Hetty--a home such as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could expect her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to be
content with after the comfort and plenty of the Farm. Like all
strong natures, Adam had confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) ability to achieve
something in the future; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) felt sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) should some day, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
lived, be able to maintain a family and make a good broad path for
himself; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had too cool a head not to estimate to the full the
obstacles that were to be overcome. And the time would be so
long! And there was Hetty, like a bright-cheeked apple hanging
over the orchard wall, within sight of everybody, and everybody
must long for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)! To be sure, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) very much, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
would be content to wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>): but did she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) love him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)? His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hopes
had never risen so high that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had dared to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was clearsighted enough to be aware that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) uncle and aunt would have
looked kindly on his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) suit, and indeed, without this encouragement
he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) would never have persevered in going to the Farm; but it was
impossible to come to any but fluctuating conclusions about
Hetty's feelings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was like a kitten, and had the same
distractingly pretty looks, that meant nothing, for everybody that
came near her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>).
But now he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) could not help saying to himself that the heaviest
part of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) burden was removed, and that even before the end of
another year his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) circumstances might be brought into a shape that
would allow him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to think of marrying. It would always be a hard
struggle with his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) mother, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) knew: she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would be jealous of any
wife he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) might choose, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had set her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mind especially against
Hetty--perhaps for no other reason than that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) suspected Hetty
to be the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had chosen. It would never do, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) feared, for
his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) mother to live in the same house with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was



<p/>276

<p/>married; and yet how hard she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would think it if he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to
leave him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)! Yes, there was a great deal of pain to be gone through
with his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) mother, but it was a case in which he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) must make her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) feel
that his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) will was strong--it would be better for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in the end. For
himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) would have liked that they should all live together till
Seth was married, and they might have built a bit themselves to
the old house, and made more room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) did not like <div class="bookquote">``to part wi'
th' lad'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>: they had hardly every been separated for more than a day
since they were born.
But Adam had no sooner caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) imagination leaping
forward in this way--making arrangements for an uncertain
future--than he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) checked himself. <div class="bookquote">``A pretty building I'm making,
without either bricks or timber. I'm up i' the garret a'ready, and
haven't so much as dug the foundation.''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Whenever Adam was
strongly convinced of any proposition, it took the form of a
principle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mind: it was knowledge to be acted on, as much as
the knowledge that damp will cause rust. Perhaps here lay the
secret of the hardness he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had accused himself of: he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had too little
fellow-feeling with the weakness that errs in spite of foreseen
consequences. Without this fellow-feeling, how are we to get
enough patience and charity towards our stumbling, falling
companions in the long and changeful journey? And there is but
one way in which a strong determined soul can learn it--by
getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) heart-strings bound round the weak and erring, so that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) must share not only the outward consequence of their error,
but their inward suffering. That is a long and hard lesson, and
Adam had at present only learned the alphabet of it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father's
sudden death, which, by annihilating in an instant all that had
stimulated his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) indignation, had sent a sudden rush of thought and



<p/>277

<p/>memory over what had claimed his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) pity and tenderness.
But it was Adam's strength, not its correlative hardness, that
influenced his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) meditations this morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had long made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
mind that it would be wrong as well as foolish for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to marry a
blooming young girl, so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had no other prospect than that
of growing poverty with a growing family. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) savings had
been so constantly drawn upon -LRB-besides the terrible sweep of
paying for Seth's substitute in the militia-RRB- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had not enough
money beforehand to furnish even a small cottage, and keep
something in reserve against a rainy day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had good hope that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) should be <div class="bookquote">``firmer on his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) legs''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>by and by; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) could not be
satisfied with a vague confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) arm and brain; he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) must
have definite plans, and set about them at once. The partnership
with Jonathan Burge was not to be thought of at present--there
were things implicitly tacked to it that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) could not accept; but
Adam thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) and Seth might carry on a little business for
themselves in addition to their journeyman's work, by buying a
small stock of superior wood and making articles of household
furniture, for which Adam had no end of contrivances. Seth might
gain more by working at separate jobs under Adam's direction
than by his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) journeyman's work, and Adam, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) over-hours,
could do all the <div class="bookquote">``nice''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>work that required peculiar skill. The
money gained in this way, with the good wages he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) received as
foreman, would soon enable them to get beforehand with the
world, so sparingly as they would all live now. No sooner had this
little plan shaped itself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mind than he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) began to be busy with
exact calculations about the wood to be bought and the particular
article of furniture that should be undertaken first--a kitchen
cupboard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) own contrivance, with such an ingenious



<p/>278

<p/>arrangement of sliding-doors and bolts, such convenient nooks for
stowing household provender, and such a symmetrical result to
the eye, that every good housewife would be in raptures with it,
and fall through all the gradations of melancholy longing till her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>)
husband promised to buy it for her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>). Adam pictured to himself Mrs.
Poyser examining it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) keen eye and trying in vain to find
out a deficiency; and, of course, close to Mrs. Poyser stood Hetty,
and Adam was again beguiled from calculations and contrivances
into dreams and hopes. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) this
evening--it was so long since he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had been at the Hall Farm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
would have liked to go to the night-school, to see why Bartle
Massey had not been at church yesterday, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) feared his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) old
friend was ill; but, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) could manage both visits, this last
must be put off till to-morrow--the desire to be near Hetty and to
speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) again was too strong.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) mind to this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) was coming very near to the
end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) walk, within the sound of the hammers at work on the
refitting of the old house. The sound of tools to a clever workman
who loves his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) work is like the tentative sounds of the orchestra to
the violinist who has to bear his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) part in the overture: the strong
fibres begin their accustomed thrill, and what was a moment
before joy, vexation, or ambition, begins its change into energy. All
passion becomes strength when it has an outlet from the narrow
limits of our personal lot in the labour of our right arm, the
cunning of our right hand, or the still, creative activity of our
thought. Look at Adam through the rest of the day, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) stands on
the scaffolding with the two-feet ruler in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hand, whistling low
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) considers how a difficulty about a floor-joist or a windowframe is to be overcome; or as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) pushes one of the younger



<p/>279

<p/>workmen aside and takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) place in upheaving a weight of
timber, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Let alone, lad! Thee'st got too much gristle i' thy
bones yet'' (<font color='red'><b>the workmen</b></font>)</div>; or as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) fixes his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) keen black eyes on the motions of a
workman on the other side of the room and warns him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
distances are not right. Look at this broad-shouldered man with
the bare muscular arms, and the thick, firm, black hair tossed
about like trodden meadow-grass whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) takes off his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) paper
cap, and with the strong barytone voice bursting every now and
then into loud and solemn psalm-tunes, as if seeking an outlet for
superfluous strength, yet presently checking himself, apparently
crossed by some thought which jars with the singing. Perhaps, if
you had not been already in the secret, you might not have
guessed what sad memories what warm affection, what tender
fluttering hopes, had their home in this athletic body with the
broken finger-nails--in this rough man, who knew no better lyrics
than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could find in the Old and New Version and an occasional
hymn; who knew the smallest possible amount of profane history;
and for whom the motion and shape of the earth, the course of the
sun, and the changes of the seasons lay in the region of mystery
just made visible by fragmentary knowledge. It had cost Adam a
great deal of trouble and work in over-hours to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
knew over and above the secrets of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) handicraft, and that
acquaintance with mechanics and figures, and the nature of the
materials he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) worked with, which was made easy to him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) by inborn
inherited faculty--to get the mastery of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) pen, and write a plain
hand, to spell without any other mistakes than must in fairness be
attributed to the unreasonable character of orthography rather
than to any deficiency in the speller, and, moreover, to learn his (<font color='blue'><b>speller</b></font>)
musical notes and part-singing. Besides all this, he (<font color='blue'><b>speller</b></font>) had read his (<font color='blue'><b>speller</b></font>)



<p/>280

<p/>Bible, including the apocryphal books; Poor Richard's Almanac,
Taylor's Holy Living and Dying, The Pilgrim's Progress, with
Bunyan's Life and Holy War, a great deal of Bailey's Dictionary,
Valentine and Orson, and part of a History of Babylon, which Bartle
Massey had lent him (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) might have had many more books from
Bartle Massey, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) had no time for reading <div class="bookquote">``the commin print,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as Lisbeth called it, so busy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) was with figures in all the leisure
moments which he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) did not fill up with extra carpentry.
Adam, you perceive, was by no means a marvellous man, nor,
properly speaking, a genius, yet I will not pretend that his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) was an
ordinary character among workmen; and it would not be at all a
safe conclusion that the next best man you may happen to see with
a basket of tools over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder and a paper cap on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head has
the strong conscience and the strong sense, the blended
susceptibility and self-command, of our friend Adam. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was not
an average man. Yet such men as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) are reared here and there in
every generation of our peasant artisans--with an inheritance of
affections nurtured by a simple family life of common need and
common industry, and an inheritance of faculties trained in skilful
courageous labour: they make their way upwards, rarely as
geniuses, most commonly as painstaking honest men, with the
skill and conscience to do well the tasks that lie before them. Their
lives have no discernible echo beyond the neighbourhood where
they dwelt, but you are almost sure to find there some good piece
of road, some building, some application of mineral produce, some
improvement in farming practice, some reform of parish abuses,
with which their names are associated by one or two generations
after them. Their employers were the richer for them, the work of
their hands has worn well, and the work of their brains has guided



<p/>281

<p/>well the hands of other men. They went about in their youth in
flannel or paper caps, in coats black with coal-dust or streaked
with lime and red paint; in old age their white hairs are seen in a
place of honour at church and at market, and they tell their welldressed sons and daughters, seated round the bright hearth on
winter evenings, how pleased they were when they first earned
their twopence a-day. Others there are who die poor and never put
off the workman's coal on weekdays. They have not had the art of
getting rich, but they are men of trust, and when they die before
the work is all out of them, it is as if some main screw had got
loose in a machine; the master who employed them says, <div class="bookquote">``Where
shall I find their like?''

<p/>Chapter XX
Adam Visits the Hall Farm

<p/>A

<p/>dam came back from his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) work in the empty waggon--that
was why he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) clothes--and was ready to
set out to the Hall Farm when it still wanted a quarter to

<p/>seven.
<div class="bookquote">``What's thee got thy Sunday cloose on for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Lisbeth
complainingly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) came downstairs. <div class="bookquote">``Thee artna goin' to th'
school i' thy best coat?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, quietly. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to the Hall Farm,
but mayhap I may go to the school after, so thee mustna wonder if
I'm a bit late. Seth 'ull be at home in half an hour--he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)'s only gone
to the village; so thee wutna mind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Eh, an' what's thee got thy best cloose on for to go to th' Hall
Farm? The Poyser folks see'd thee in ’em yesterday, I warrand.
What dost mean by turnin' worki' day into Sunday a-that’n? It's
poor keepin' company wi' folks as donna like to see thee i' thy
workin' jacket.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, mother, I can't stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hat
and going out.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had no sooner gone a few paces beyond the door than
Lisbeth became uneasy at the thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) had vexed him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). Of
course, the secret of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) objection to the best clothes was her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>)
suspicion that they were put on for Hetty's sake; but deeper than
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) peevishness lay the need that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) son should love her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>)
hurried after him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), and laid hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) arm before he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had got half-




<p/>283

<p/>way down to the brook, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Nay, my lad, thee wutna go
away angered wi' thy mother, an' her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) got nought to do but to sit by
hersen an' think on thee?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay, Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, gravely, and standing still
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) arm on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) shoulder, <div class="bookquote">``I'm not angered. But I
wish, for thy own sake, thee'dst be more contented to let me do
what I've made up my mind to do. I'll never be no other than a
good son to thee as long as we live. But a man has other feelings
besides what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) owes to's father and mother, and thee oughtna to
want to rule over me body and soul. And thee must make up thy
mind as I'll not give way to thee where I've a right to do what I
like. So let us have no more words about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Eh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Lisbeth, not willing to show that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) felt the real
bearing of Adam's words, <div class="bookquote">``and' who likes to see thee i' thy best
cloose better nor thy mother? An' when thee 'st got thy face
washed as clean as the smooth white pibble, an' thy hair combed
so nice, and thy eyes a-sparklin'--what else is there as thy old
mother should like to look at half so well? An' thee sha't put on thy
Sunday cloose when thee lik'st for me--I'll ne’er plague thee no
moor about’n.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, well; good-bye, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) and
hurrying away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) saw there was no other means of putting an
end to the dialogue. Lisbeth stood still on the spot, shading her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>)
eyes and looking after him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was quite out of sight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) felt to
the full all the meaning that had lain in Adam's words, and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>)
lost sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) and turned back slowly into the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) said
aloud to herself--for it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) way to speak her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) thoughts aloud in
the long days when her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) husband and sons were at their work--
``Eh, he (<font color='blue'><b>thy</b></font>)'ll be tellin' me as he (<font color='blue'><b>thy</b></font>)'s goin' to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) home one o' these



<p/>284

<p/>days; an' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'ll be missis o’er me, and I mun look on, belike, while
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) uses the blue-edged platters, and breaks ’em, mayhap, though
there's ne’er been one broke sin' my old man an' me bought ’em at
the fair twenty 'ear come next Whis-suntide. Eh!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) went on, still
louder, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) caught up her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) knitting from the table, ``but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'ll
ne’er knit the lad's stockin's, nor foot ’em nayther, while I live; an'
when I'm gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'ll bethink him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) as nobody 'ull ne’er fit's leg an'
foot as his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) old mother did. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'ll know nothin' o' narrowin' an'
heelin', I warrand, an' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'ll make a long toe as he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) canna get's boot
on. That's what comes o' marr'in' young wenches. I war gone
thirty, an' th' feyther too, afore we war married; an' young enough
too. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'ll be a poor dratchell by then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s thirty, a-marr'in' athat’n, afore her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) teeth's all come.''
Adam walked so fast that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was at the yard-gate before seven.
Martin Poyser and the grandfather were not yet come in from the
meadow: every one was in the meadow, even to the black-and-tan
terrier--no one kept watch in the yard but the bull-dog; and when
Adam reached the house-door, which stood wide open, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) saw
there was no one in the bright clean house-place. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) guessed
where Mrs. Poyser and some one else would be, quite within
hearing; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) knocked on the door and said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) strong voice,
``Mrs. Poyser within?''
``Come in, Mr. Bede, come in,'' Mrs. Poyser called out from the
dairy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) always gave Adam this title when she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) received him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) own house. ``You may come into the dairy if you will, for I
canna justly leave the cheese.''
Adam walked into the dairy, where Mrs. Poyser and Nancy
were crushing the first evening cheese.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, you might think you war come to a dead-house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said



<p/>285

<p/>Mrs. Poyser, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) stood in the open doorway; <div class="bookquote">``they're all i' the
meadow; but Martin's sure to be in afore long, for they're leaving
the hay cocked to-night, ready for carrying first thing to-morrow.
I've been forced t' have Nancy in, upo' 'count as Hetty must gether
the red currants to-night; the fruit allays ripens so contrairy, just
when every hand's wanted. An' there's no trustin' the children to
gether it, for they put more into their own mouths nor into the
basket; you might as well set the wasps to gether the fruit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Adam longed to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would go into the garden till Mr. Poyser
came in, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was not quite courageous enough, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I
could be looking at your spinning-wheel, then, and see what wants
doing to it. Perhaps it stands in the house, where I can find it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I've put it away in the right-hand parlour; but let it be till I
can fetch it and show it you. I'd be glad now if you'd go into the
garden and tell Hetty to send Totty in. The child 'ull run in if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s
told, an' I know Hetty's lettin' her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eat too many currants. I'll be
much obliged to you, Mr. Bede, if you'll go and send her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) in; an'
there's the York and Lankester roses beautiful in the garden
now--you'll like to see ’em. But you'd like a drink o' whey first,
p'r'aps; I know you're fond o' whey, as most folks is when they
hanna got to crush it out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Mrs. Poyser,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam; <div class="bookquote">``a drink o' whey's allays
a treat to me. I'd rather have it than beer any day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser, reaching a small white basin that
stood on the shelf, and dipping it into the whey-tub, ``the smell o'
bread's sweet t' everybody but the baker. The Miss Irwines allays
say, `Oh, Mrs. Poyser, I envy you your dairy; and I envy you your
chickens; and what a beautiful thing a farm-house is, to be sure!'
An' I say, `Yes; a farm-house is a fine thing for them as look on, an'



<p/>286

<p/>don't know the liftin', an' the stannin', an' the worritin' o' th' inside
as belongs to 't.'''
<div class="bookquote">``Why, Mrs. Poyser, you wouldn't like to live anywhere else but
in a farm-house, so well as you manage it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, taking the
basin; <div class="bookquote">``and there can be nothing to look at pleasanter nor a fine
milch cow, standing up to 'ts knees in pasture, and the new milk
frothing in the pail, and the fresh butter ready for market, and the
calves, and the poultry. Here's to your health, and may you allays
have strength to look after your own dairy, and set a pattern t' all
the farmers' wives in the country.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Poyser was not to be caught in the weakness of smiling at
a compliment, but a quiet complacency over-spread her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) face like a
stealing sunbeam, and gave a milder glance than usual to her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) bluegrey eyes, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) looked at Adam drinking the whey. Ah! I think I
taste that whey now--with a flavour so delicate that one can
hardly distinguish it from an odour, and with that soft gliding
warmth that fills one's imagination with a still, happy dreaminess.
And the light music of the dropping whey is in my ears, mingling
with the twittering of a bird outside the wire network window--
the window overlooking the garden, and shaded by tall gueldre
roses.
<div class="bookquote">``Have a little more, Mr. Bede?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser, as Adam set
down the basin.
<div class="bookquote">``No, thank you; I'll go into the garden now, and send in the
little lass.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye, do; and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) mother in the dairy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam walked round by the rick-yard, at present empty of ricks,
to the little wooden gate leading into the garden--once the welltended kitchen-garden of a manor-house; now, but for the



<p/>287

<p/>handsome brick wall with stone coping that ran along one side of
it, a true farmhouse garden, with hardy perennial flowers,
unpruned fruit-trees, and kitchen vegetables growing together in
careless, half-neglected abundance. In that leafy, flowery, bushy
time, to look for any one in this garden was like playing at <div class="bookquote">``hideand-seek.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There were the tall hollyhocks beginning to flower and
dazzle the eye with their pink, white, and yellow; there were the
syringas and gueldre roses, all large and disorderly for want of
trimming; there were leafy walls of scarlet beans and late peas;
there was a row of bushy filberts in one direction, and in another a
huge apple-tree making a barren circle under its low-spreading
boughs. But what signified a barren patch or two? The garden was
so large. There was always a superfluity of broad beans--it took
nine or ten of Adam's strides to get to the end of the uncut grass
walk that ran by the side of them; and as for other vegetables,
there was so much more room than was necessary for them that in
the rotation of crops a large flourishing bed of groundsel was of
yearly occurrence on one spot or other. The very rose-trees at
which Adam stopped to pluck one looked as if they grew wild; they
were all huddled together in bushy masses, now flaunting with
wide-open petals, almost all of them of the streaked pink-andwhite kind, which doubtless dated from the union of the houses of
York and Lancaster. Adam was wise enough to choose a compact
Provence rose that peeped out half-smothered by its flaunting
scentless neighbours, and held it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hand--he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
should be more at ease holding something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hand--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
walked on to the far end of the garden, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) remembered
there was the largest row of currant-trees, not far off from the
great yew-tree arbour.



<p/>288

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had not gone many steps beyond the roses, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
heard the shaking of a bough, and a boy's voice saying, <div class="bookquote">``Now,
then, Totty, hold out your pinny--there's a duck.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a boy</b></font>)</div>The voice came from the boughs of a tall cherry-tree, where
Adam had no difficulty in discerning a small blue-pinafored figure
perched in a commodious position where the fruit was thickest.
Doubtless Totty was below, behind the screen of peas. Yes--with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) bonnet hanging down her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) back, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) fat face, dreadfully
smeared with red juice, turned up towards the cherry-tree, while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) little round hole of a mouth and her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) red-stained
pinafore to receive the promised downfall. I am sorry to say, more
than half the cherries that fell were hard and yellow instead of
juicy and red; but Totty spent no time in useless regrets, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
was already sucking the third juiciest when Adam said, <div class="bookquote">``There
now, Totty, you've got your cherries. Run into the house with ’em
to Mother--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) wants you--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s in the dairy. Run in this
minute--there's a good little girl.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) strong arms and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) spoke, a
ceremony which Totty regarded as a tiresome interruption to
cherry-eating; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) set her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) down she (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) trotted off quite
silently towards the house, sucking her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) cherries as she (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) went along.
<div class="bookquote">``Tommy, my lad, take care you're not shot for a little thieving
bird,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) walked on towards the currant-trees.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could see there was a large basket at the end of the row:
Hetty would not be far off, and Adam already felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) were
looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). Yet when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) turned the corner she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was standing
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) back towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), and stooping to gather the lowhanging fruit. Strange that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had not heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) coming!
Perhaps it was because she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was making the leaves rustle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)



<p/>289

<p/>started when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) became conscious that some one was near--
started so violently that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) dropped the basin with the currants in
it, and then, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) saw it was Adam, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) turned from pale to
deep red. That blush made his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) heart beat with a new happiness.
Hetty had never blushed at seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) before.
<div class="bookquote">``I frightened you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, with a delicious sense that it didn't
signify what he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, since Hetty seemed to feel as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) did;
<div class="bookquote">``let me pick the currants up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That was soon done, for they had only fallen in a tangled mass
on the grass-plot, and Adam, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) rose and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) the basin
again, looked straight into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eyes with the subdued tenderness
that belongs to the first moments of hopeful love.
Hetty did not turn away her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eyes; her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) blush had subsided, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) glance with a quiet sadness, which contented Adam
because it was so unlike anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had seen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) before.
<div class="bookquote">``There's not many more currants to get,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I shall soon
ha' done now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll help you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) fetched the large basket,
which was nearly full of currants, and set it close to them.
Not a word more was spoken as they gathered the currants.
Adam's heart was too full to speak, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought Hetty knew all
that was in it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was not indifferent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) presence after all; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
had blushed when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), and then there was that touch of
sadness about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) which must surely mean love, since it was the
opposite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) usual manner, which had often impressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) as
indifference. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) continually as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) bent
over the fruit, while the level evening sunbeams stole through the
thick apple-tree boughs, and rested on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) round cheek and neck
as if they too were in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). It was to Adam the time that a



<p/>290

<p/>man can least forget in after-life, the time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) believes that
the first woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) has ever loved betrays by a slight something--a
word, a tone, a glance, the quivering of a lip or an eyelid--that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
is at least beginning to love him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) in return. The sign is so slight, it is
scarcely perceptible to the ear or eye--he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) could describe it to no
one--it is a mere feather-touch, yet it seems to have changed his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>)
whole being, to have merged an uneasy yearning into a delicious
unconsciousness of everything but the present moment. So much
of our early gladness vanishes utterly from our memory: we can
never recall the joy with which we laid our heads on our mother's
bosom or rode on our father's back in childhood. Doubtless that
joy is wrought up into our nature, as the sunlight of long-past
mornings is wrought up in the soft mellowness of the apricot, but
it is gone for ever from our imagination, and we can only believe in
the joy of childhood. But the first glad moment in our first love is a
vision which returns to us to the last, and brings with it a thrill of
feeling intense and special as the recurrent sensation of a sweet
odour breathed in a far-off hour of happiness. It is a memory that
gives a more exquisite touch to tenderness, that feeds the madness
of jealousy and adds the last keenness to the agony of despair.
Hetty bending over the red bunches, the level rays piercing the
screen of apple-tree boughs, the length of bushy garden beyond,
his (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) own emotion as he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was
thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>), and that there was no need for them to talk--
Adam remembered it all to the last moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) life.
And Hetty? You know quite well that Adam was mistaken
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). Like many other men, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought the signs of love for
another were signs of love towards himself. When Adam was
approaching unseen by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was absorbed as usual in thinking



<p/>291

<p/>and wondering about Arthur's possible return. The sound of any
man's footstep would have affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) just in the same way--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
would have felt it might be Arthur before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had time to see, and
the blood that forsook her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cheek in the agitation of that
momentary feeling would have rushed back again at the sight of
any one else just as much as at the sight of Adam. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was not
wrong in thinking that a change had come over Hetty: the
anxieties and fears of a first passion, with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was
trembling, had become stronger than vanity, had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) for the
first time that sense of helpless dependence on another's feeling
which awakens the clinging deprecating womanhood even in the
shallowest girl that can ever experience it, and creates in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a
sensibility to kindness which found her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) quite hard before. For the
first time Hetty felt that there was something soothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) in
Adam's timid yet manly tenderness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) wanted to be treated
lovingly--oh, it was very hard to bear this blank of absence,
silence, apparent indifference, after those moments of glowing
love! She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was not afraid that Adam would tease her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) with lovemaking and flattering speeches like her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) other admirers; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had
always been so reserved to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could enjoy without any fear
the sense that this strong brave man loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and was near her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>).
It never entered into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mind that Adam was pitiable too--that
Adam too must suffer one day.
Hetty, we know, was not the first woman that had behaved
more gently to the man who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) in vain because she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had
herself begun to love another. It was a very old story, but Adam
knew nothing about it, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) drank in the sweet delusion.
<div class="bookquote">``That'll do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>said Hetty, after a little while. <div class="bookquote">``Aunt wants me to
leave some on the trees. I'll take ’em in now.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>292

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very well I came to carry the basket,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam <div class="bookquote">``for it 'ud
ha' been too heavy for your little arms.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No; I could ha' carried it with both hands.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I daresay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``and been as long getting
into the house as a little ant carrying a caterpillar. Have you ever
seen those tiny fellows carrying things four times as big as
themselves?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>said Hetty, indifferently, not caring to know the
difficulties of ant life.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, I used to watch ’em often when I was a lad. But now, you
see, I can carry the basket with one arm, as if it was an empty
nutshell, and give you th' other arm to lean on. Won't you? Such
big arms as mine were made for little arms like yours to lean on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>Hetty smiled faintly and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) arm within his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). Adam looked
down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), but her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eyes were turned dreamily towards another
corner of the garden.
<div class="bookquote">``Have you ever been to Eagledale?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said, as they walked
slowly along.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, pleased to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) ask a question about
himself. <div class="bookquote">``Ten years ago, when I was a lad, I went with father to see
about some work there. It's a wonderful sight--rocks and caves
such as you never saw in your life. I never had a right notion o'
rocks till I went there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How long did it take to get there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Why, it took us the best part o' two days' walking. But it's
nothing of a day's journey for anybody as has got a first-rate nag.
The captain 'ud get there in nine or ten hours, I'll be bound, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'s
such a rider. And I shouldn't wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'s back again to-morrow;
he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'s too active to rest long in that lonely place, all by himself, for



<p/>293

<p/>there's nothing but a bit of a inn i' that part where he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'s gone to
fish. I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'d got th' estate in his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) hands; that 'ud be the right
thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>), for it 'ud give him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) plenty to do, and he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'d do 't well
too, for all he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'s so young; he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'s got better notions o' things than
many a man twice his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) age. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) spoke very handsome to me th'
other day about lending me money to set up i' business; and if
things came round that way, I'd rather be beholding to him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) nor to
any man i' the world.''
Poor Adam was led on to speak about Arthur because he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
thought Hetty would be pleased to know that the young squire was
so ready to befriend him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>); the fact entered into his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) future
prospects, which he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) would like to seem promising in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eyes. And
it was true that Hetty listened with an interest which brought a
new light into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eyes and a half-smile upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) lips.
``How pretty the roses are now!'' Adam continued, pausing to
look at them. ``See! I stole the prettiest, but I didna mean to keep it
myself. I think these as are all pink, and have got a finer sort o'
green leaves, are prettier than the striped uns, don't you?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) set down the basket and took the rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) button-hole.
``It smells very sweet,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``those striped uns have no
smell. Stick it in your frock, and then you can put it in water after.
It 'ud be a pity to let it fade.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hetty took the rose, smiling as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) did so at the pleasant
thought that Arthur could so soon get back if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) liked. There was a
flash of hope and happiness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mind, and with a sudden
impulse of gaiety she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) did what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had very often done before--
stuck the rose in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hair a little above the left ear. The tender
admiration in Adam's face was slightly shadowed by reluctant
disapproval. Hetty's love of finery was just the thing that would



<p/>294

<p/>most provoke his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) himself disliked it as much as it
was possible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to dislike anything that belonged to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that's like the ladies in the pictures at the Chase;
they've mostly got flowers or feathers or gold things i' their hair,
but somehow I don't like to see ’em they allays put me i' mind o'
the painted women outside the shows at Treddles'on Fair. What
can a woman have to set her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) off better than her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own hair, when it
curls so, like yours? If a woman's young and pretty, I think you
can see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) good looks all the better for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) being plain dressed.
Why, Dinah Morris looks very nice, for all she (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) wears such a plain
cap and gown. It seems to me as a woman's face doesna want
flowers; it's almost like a flower itself. I'm sure yours is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>said Hetty, with a little playful pout, taking the
rose out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hair. <div class="bookquote">``I'll put one o' Dinah's caps on when we go in,
and you'll see if I look better in it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) left one behind, so I can
take the pattern.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay, I don't want you to wear a Methodist cap like
Dinah's. I daresay it's a very ugly cap, and I used to think when I
saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) here as it was nonsense for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) to dress different t' other
people; but I never rightly noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) till she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) came to see mother
last week, and then I thought the cap seemed to fit her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) face
somehow as th' acorn-cup fits th' acorn, and I shouldn't like to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) so well without it. But you've got another sort o' face; I'd have
you just as you are now, without anything t' interfere with your
own looks. It's like when a man's singing a good tune--you don't
want t' hear bells tinkling and interfering wi' the sound.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) arm and put it within his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) again, looking down on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) fondly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) should think he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had lectured her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>),
imagining, as we are apt to do, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had perceived all the



<p/>295

<p/>thoughts he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had only half-expressed. And the thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) dreaded
most was lest any cloud should come over this evening's
happiness. For the world he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would not have spoken of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) love to
Hetty yet, till this commencing kindness towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) should have
grown into unmistakable love. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) imagination he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) saw long
years of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) future life stretching before him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), blest with the right to
call Hetty his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) own: he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could be content with very little at present.
So he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) took up the basket of currants once more, and they went on
towards the house.
The scene had quite changed in the half-hour that Adam had
been in the garden. The yard was full of life now: Marty was
letting the screaming geese through the gate, and wickedly
provoking the gander by hissing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Marty</b></font>); the granary-door was
groaning on its hinges as Alick shut it, after dealing out the corn;
the horses were being led out to watering, amidst much barking of
all the three dogs and many <div class="bookquote">``whups''  (<font color='red'><b>Alick</b></font>)</div>from Tim the ploughman, as
if the heavy animals who held down their meek, intelligent heads,
and lifted their shaggy feet so deliberately, were likely to rush
wildly in every direction but the right. Everybody was come back
from the meadow; and when Hetty and Adam entered the houseplace, Mr. Poyser was seated in the three-cornered chair, and the
grandfather in the large arm-chair opposite, looking on with
pleasant expectation while the supper was being laid on the oak
table. Mrs. Poyser had laid the cloth herself--a cloth made of
homespun linen, with a shining checkered pattern on it, and of an
agreeable whitey-brown hue, such as all sensible housewives like
to see--none of your bleached <div class="bookquote">``shop-rag''  (<font color='red'><b>all housewives</b></font>)</div>that would wear into
holes in no time, but good homespun that would last for two
generations. The cold veal, the fresh lettuces, and the stuffed chine



<p/>296

<p/>might well look tempting to hungry men who had dined at halfpast twelve o’clock. On the large deal table against the wall there
were bright pewter plates and spoons and cans, ready for Alick
and his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) companions; for the master and servants ate their supper
not far off each other; which was all the pleasanter, because if a
remark about to-morrow morning's work occurred to Mr. Poyser,
Alick was at hand to hear it.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, Adam, I'm glad to see ye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser. <div class="bookquote">``What! ye've
been helping Hetty to gether the curran's, eh? Come, sit ye down,
sit ye down. Why, it's pretty near a three-week since y' had your
supper with us; and the missis has got one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) rare stuffed
chines. I'm glad ye're come.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hetty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) looked into the basket of
currants to see if the fruit was fine, <div class="bookquote">``run upstairs and send Molly
down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s putting Totty to bed, and I want her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to draw th' ale,
for Nancy's busy yet i' the dairy. You can see to the child. But
whativer did you let her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) run away from you along wi' Tommy for,
and stuff herself wi' fruit as she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) can't eat a bit o' good victual?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>This was said in a lower tone than usual, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) husband
was talking to Adam; for Mrs. Poyser was strict in adherence to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) own rules of propriety, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) considered that a young girl
was not to be treated sharply in the presence of a respectable man
who was courting her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>). That would not be fair-play: every woman
was young in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turn, and had her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chances of matrimony, which
it was a point of honour for other women not to spoil--just as one
market-woman who has sold her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own eggs must not try to balk
another of a customer.
Hetty made haste to run away upstairs, not easily finding an
answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt's question, and Mrs. Poyser went out to see



<p/>297

<p/>after Marty and Tommy and bring them in to supper.
Soon they were all seated--the two rosy lads, one on each side,
by the pale mother, a place being left for Hetty between Adam and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) uncle. Alick too was come in, and was seated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) far corner,
eating cold broad beans out of a large dish with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) pocket-knife,
and finding a flavour in them which he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would not have exchanged
for the finest pineapple.
<div class="bookquote">``What a time that gell is drawing th' ale, to be sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Poyser, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was dispensing her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) slices of stuffed chine. <div class="bookquote">``I
think she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) sets the jug under and forgets to turn the tap, as there's
nothing you can't believe o' them wenches: they'll set the empty
kettle o' the fire, and then come an hour after to see if the water
boils.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)'s drawin' for the men too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser. <div class="bookquote">``Thee
shouldst ha' told her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) to bring our jug up first.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Told her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I might spend all the wind i'
my body, an' take the bellows too, if I was to tell them gells
everything as their own sharpness wonna tell ’em. Mr. Bede, will
you take some vinegar with your lettuce? Aye you're i' the right
not. It spoils the flavour o' the chine, to my thinking. It's poor
eating where the flavour o' the meat lies i' the cruets. There's folks
as make bad butter and trusten to the salt t' hide it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Poyser's attention was here diverted by the appearance of
Molly, carrying a large jug, two small mugs, and four drinkingcans, all full of ale or small beer--an interesting example of the
prehensile power possessed by the human hand. Poor Molly's
mouth was rather wider open than usual, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) walked along with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes fixed on the double cluster of vessels in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hands, quite
innocent of the expression in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mistress's eye.



<p/>298

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly, I niver knew your equils--to think o' your poor mother
as is a widow, an' I took you wi' as good as no character, an' the
times an' times I've told you ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Molly</b></font>)</div>Molly had not seen the lightning, and the thunder shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
nerves the more for the want of that preparation. With a vague
alarmed sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) must somehow comport herself differently,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hastened her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) step a little towards the far deal table, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
might set down her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) cans--caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) foot in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) apron, which had
become untied, and fell with a crash and a splash into a pool of
beer; whereupon a tittering explosion from Marty and Tommy,
and a serious <div class="bookquote">``Ello!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tommy</b></font>)</div>from Mr. Poyser, who saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) draught of ale
unpleasantly deferred.
<div class="bookquote">``There you go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>resumed Mrs. Poyser, in a cutting tone, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
rose and went towards the cupboard while Molly began dolefully
to pick up the fragments of pottery. <div class="bookquote">``It's what I told you 'ud come,
over and over again; and there's your month's wage gone, and
more, to pay for that jug as I've had i' the house this ten year, and
nothing ever happened to 't before; but the crockery you've broke
sin' here in th' house you've been 'ud make a parson swear--God
forgi' me for saying so--an' if it had been boiling wort out o' the
copper, it 'ud ha' been the same, and you'd ha' been scalded and
very like lamed for life, as there's no knowing but what you will be
some day if you go on; for anybody 'ud think you'd got the St.
Vitus's Dance, to see the things you've throwed down. It's a pity
but what the bits was stacked up for you to see, though it's neither
seeing nor hearing as 'ull make much odds to you--anybody 'ud
think you war case-hardened.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Molly</b></font>)</div>Poor Molly's tears were dropping fast by this time, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
desperation at the lively movement of the beer-stream towards



<p/>299

<p/>Alick's legs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was converting her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) apron into a mop, while Mrs.
Poyser, opening the cupboard, turned a blighting eye upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``you'll do no good wi' crying an' making
more wet to wipe up. It's all your own wilfulness, as I tell you, for
there's nobody no call to break anything if they'll only go the right
way to work. But wooden folks had need ha' wooden things t'
handle. And here must I take the brown-and-white jug, as it's
niver been used three times this year, and go down i' the cellar
myself, and belike catch my death, and be laid up wi' inflammation
...''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Poyser had turned round from the cupboard with the
brown-and-white jug in her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) hand, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) caught sight of
something at the other end of the kitchen; perhaps it was because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was already trembling and nervous that the apparition had so
strong an effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>); perhaps jug-breaking, like other crimes,
has a contagious influence. However it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) stared and started
like a ghost-seer, and the precious brown-and-white jug fell to the
ground, parting for ever with its spout and handle.
<div class="bookquote">``Did ever anybody see the like?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) said, with a suddenly
lowered tone, after a moment's bewildered glance round the room.
<div class="bookquote">``The jugs are bewitched, I think. It's them nasty glazed handles--
they slip o’er the finger like a snail.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, thee 'st let thy own whip fly i' thy face,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
husband, who had now joined in the laugh of the young ones.
<div class="bookquote">``It's all very fine to look on and grin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mrs. Poyser;
``but there's times when the crockery seems alive an' flies out o'
your hand like a bird. It's like the glass, sometimes, 'ull crack as it
stands. What is to be broke will be broke, for I never dropped a
thing i' my life for want o' holding it, else I should never ha' kept



<p/>300

<p/>the crockery all these 'ears as I bought at my own wedding. And
Hetty, are you mad? Whativer do you mean by coming down i'
that way, and making one think as there's a ghost a-walking i' th'
house?''
A new outbreak of laughter, while Mrs. Poyser was speaking,
was caused, less by her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) sudden conversion to a fatalistic view of
jug-breaking than by that strange appearance of Hetty, which had
startled her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt. The little minx had found a black gown of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
aunt's, and pinned it close round her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) neck to look like Dinah's, had
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hair as flat as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) could, and had tied on one of Dinah's
high-crowned borderless net caps. The thought of Dinah's pale
grave face and mild grey eyes, which the sight of the gown and cap
brought with it, made it a laughable surprise enough to see them
replaced by Hetty's round rosy cheeks and coquettish dark eyes.
The boys got off their chairs and jumped round her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), clapping their
hands, and even Alick gave a low ventral laugh as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) looked up
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) beans. Under cover of the noise, Mrs. Poyser went into
the back kitchen to send Nancy into the cellar with the great
pewter measure, which had some chance of being free from
bewitchment.
``Why, Hetty, lass, are ye turned Methodist?'' said Mr. Poyser,
with that comfortable slow enjoyment of a laugh which one only
sees in stout people. ``You must pull your face a deal longer before
you'll do for one; mustna she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), Adam? How come you put them
things on, eh?''
``Adam said he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) liked Dinah's cap and gown better nor my
clothes,'' said Hetty, sitting down demurely. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) says folks looks
better in ugly clothes.''
``Nay, nay,'' said Adam, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) admiringly; ``I only said



<p/>301

<p/>they seemed to suit Dinah. But if I'd said you'd look pretty in ’em,
I should ha' said nothing but what was true.''
``Why, thee thought'st Hetty war a ghost, didstna?'' said Mr.
Poyser to his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) wife, who now came back and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) seat again.
``Thee look'dst as scared as scared.''
``It little sinnifies how I looked,'' said Mrs. Poyser; <div class="bookquote">``looks 'ull
mend no jugs, nor laughing neither, as I see. Mr. Bede, I'm sorry
you've to wait so long for your ale, but it's coming in a minute.
Make yourself at home wi' th' cold potatoes: I know you like ’em.
Tommy, I'll send you to bed this minute, if you don't give over
laughing. What is there to laugh at, I should like to know? I'd
sooner cry nor laugh at the sight o' that poor thing's cap; and
there's them as 'ud be better if they could make theirselves like
her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) i' more ways nor putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) cap. It little becomes anybody
i' this house to make fun o' my sister's child, an' her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) just gone
away from us, as it went to my heart to part wi' her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). An' I know
one thing, as if trouble was to come, an' I was to be laid up i' my
bed, an' the children was to die--as there's no knowing but what
they will--an' the murrain was to come among the cattle again, an'
everything went to rack an' ruin, I say we might be glad to get
sight o' Dinah's cap again, wi' her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) own face under it, border or no
border. For she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s one o' them things as looks the brightest on a
rainy day, and loves you the best when you're most i' need on 't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Poyser, you perceive, was aware that nothing would be so
likely to expel the comic as the terrible. Tommy, who was of a
susceptible disposition, and very fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) mother, and who had,
besides, eaten so many cherries as to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) feelings less under
command than usual, was so affected by the dreadful picture she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
had made of the possible future that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) began to cry; and the



<p/>302

<p/>good-natured father, indulgent to all weaknesses but those of
negligent farmers, said to Hetty, <div class="bookquote">``You'd better take the things off
again, my lass; it hurts your aunt to see ’em.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>Hetty went upstairs again, and the arrival of the ale made an
agreeable diversion; for Adam had to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) opinion of the new
tap, which could not be otherwise than complimentary to Mrs.
Poyser; and then followed a discussion on the secrets of good
brewing, the folly of stinginess in <div class="bookquote">``hopping,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>and the doubtful
economy of a farmer's making his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) own malt. Mrs. Poyser had so
many opportunities of expressing herself with weight on these
subjects that by the time supper was ended, the ale-jug refilled,
and Mr. Poyser's pipe alight she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was once more in high good
humour, and ready, at Adam's request, to fetch the broken
spinning-wheel for his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) inspection.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, looking at it carefully, <div class="bookquote">``here's a nice bit o'
turning wanted. It's a pretty wheel. I must have it up at the
turning-shop in the village and do it there, for I've no convenience
for turning at home. If you'll send it to Mr. Burge's shop i' the
morning, I'll get it done for you by Wednesday. I've been turning it
over in my mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) continued, looking at Mr. Poyser, <div class="bookquote">``to make a
bit more convenience at home for nice jobs o' cabinet-making. I've
always done a deal at such little things in odd hours, and they're
profitable, for there's more workmanship nor material in ’em. I
look for me and Seth to get a little business for ourselves i' that
way, for I know a man at Rosseter as 'ull take as many things as
we should make, besides what we could get orders for round
about.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>Mr. Poyser entered with interest into a project which seemed a
step towards Adam's becoming a <div class="bookquote">``master-man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>and Mrs. Poyser



<p/>303

<p/>gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) approbation to the scheme of the movable kitchen
cupboard, which was to be capable of containing grocery, pickles,
crockery, and house-linen in the utmost compactness without
confusion. Hetty, once more in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) own dress, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
neckerchief pushed a little backwards on this warm evening, was
seated picking currants near the window, where Adam could see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) quite well. And so the time passed pleasantly till Adam got up
to go. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was pressed to come again soon, but not to stay longer,
for at this busy time sensible people would not run the risk of
being sleepy at five o’clock in the morning.
<div class="bookquote">``I shall take a step farther,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, <div class="bookquote">``and go on to see
Mester Massey, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) wasn't at church yesterday, and I've not
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) for a week past. I've never hardly known him (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) to miss
church before.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser, <div class="bookquote">``we've heared nothing about him (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>), for
it's the boys' hollodays now, so we can give you no account.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you'll niver think o' going there at this hour o' the night?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser, folding up her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) knitting.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mester Massey sits up late,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam. <div class="bookquote">``An' the nightschool's not over yet. Some o' the men don't come till late--they've
got so far to walk. And Bartle himself's never in bed till it's gone
eleven.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wouldna have him (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) to live wi' me, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser, <div class="bookquote">``adropping candle-grease about, as you're like to tumble down o' the
floor the first thing i' the morning.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye, eleven o’clock's late--it's late,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin Poyser/Martin</b></font>)</div>said old Martin. <div class="bookquote">``I ne’er
sot up so i' my life, not to say as it warna a marr'in', or a
christenin', or a wake, or th' harvest supper. Eleven o’clock's late.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, I sit up till after twelve often,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, laughing, ``but



<p/>304

<p/>it isn't t' eat and drink extry, it's to work extry. Good-night, Mrs.
Poyser; good-night, Hetty.''
Hetty could only smile and not shake hands, for hers were dyed
and damp with currant-juice; but all the rest gave a hearty shake
to the large palm that was held out to them, and said, ``Come
again, come again!''
``Aye, think o' that now,'' said Mr. Poyser, when Adam was out
of on the causeway. <div class="bookquote">``Sitting up till past twelve to do extry work!
Ye'll not find many men o' six-an' twenty as 'ull do to put i' the
shafts wi' him (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). If you can catch Adam for a husband, Hetty, you'll
ride i' your own spring-cart some day, I'll be your warrant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hetty was moving across the kitchen with the currants, so her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
uncle did not see the little toss of the head with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
answered him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>). To ride in a spring-cart seemed a very miserable lot
indeed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) now.




<p/>305

<p/>Chapter XXI
The Night-School and the Schoolmaster

<p/>B

<p/>artle Massey's was one of a few scattered houses on the
edge of a common, which was divided by the road to
Treddleston. Adam reached it in a quarter of an hour
after leaving the Hall Farm; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hand on the
door-latch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could see, through the curtainless window, that
there were eight or nine heads bending over the desks, lighted by
thin dips.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) entered, a reading lesson was going forward and
Bartle Massey merely nodded, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) place where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) pleased. He (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) had not come for the sake of a lesson to-night, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) mind was too full of personal matters, too full of the last two
hours he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) had passed in Hetty's presence, for him (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) to amuse himself
with a book till school was over; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) sat down in a corner and
looked on with an absent mind. It was a sort of scene which Adam
had beheld almost weekly for years; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) knew by heart every
arabesque flourish in the framed specimen of Bartle Massey's
handwriting which hung over the schoolmaster's head, by way of
keeping a lofty ideal before the minds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) pupils; he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) knew the
backs of all the books on the shelf running along the whitewashed
wall above the pegs for the slates; he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) knew exactly how many
grains were gone out of the ear of Indian corn that hung from one
of the rafters; he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) had long ago exhausted the resources of his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>)
imagination in trying to think how the bunch of leathery seaweed
had looked and grown in its native element; and from the place



<p/>306

<p/>where he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) sat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) could make nothing of the old map of England
that hung against the opposite wall, for age had turned it of a fine
yellow brown, something like that of a well-seasoned meerschaum.
The drama that was going on was almost as familiar as the scene,
nevertheless habit had not made him (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) indifferent to it, and even in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) present self-absorbed mood, Adam felt a momentary stirring of
the old fellow-feeling, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) looked at the rough men painfully
holding pen or pencil with their cramped hands, or humbly
labouring through their reading lesson.
The reading class now seated on the form in front of the
schoolmaster's desk consisted of the three most backward pupils.
Adam would have known it only by seeing Bartle Massey's face as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) looked over his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) spectacles, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) had shifted to the ridge of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) nose, not requiring them for present purposes. The face wore
its mildest expression: the grizzled bushy eyebrows had taken
their more acute angle of compassionate kindness, and the mouth,
habitually compressed with a pout of the lower lip, was relaxed so
as to be ready to speak a helpful word or syllable in a moment.
This gentle expression was the more interesting because the
schoolmaster's nose, an irregular aquiline twisted a little on one
side, had rather a formidable character; and his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) brow, moreover,
had that peculiar tension which always impresses one as a sign of
a keen impatient temperament: the blue veins stood out like cords
under the transparent yellow skin, and this intimidating brow was
softened by no tendency to baldness, for the grey bristly hair, cut
down to about an inch in length, stood round it in as close ranks as
ever.
<div class="bookquote">``Nay, Bill, nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div>Bartle was saying in a kind tone, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) nodded
to Adam, ``begin that again, and then perhaps, it'll come to you



<p/>307

<p/>what d, r, y spells. It's the same lesson you read last week, you
know.''
``Bill'' was a sturdy fellow, aged four-and-twenty, an excellent
stone-sawyer, who could get as good wages as any man in the
trade of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) years; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found a reading lesson in words of one
syllable a harder matter to deal with than the hardest stone he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
ever had to saw. The letters, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) complained, were so ``uncommon
alike, there was no tellin' ’em one from another,'' the sawyer's
business not being concerned with minute differences such as
exist between a letter with its tail turned up and a letter with its
tail turned down. But Bill had a firm determination that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) would
learn to read, founded chiefly on two reasons: first, that Tom
Hazelow, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cousin, could read anything <div class="bookquote">``right off,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>whether it
was print or writing, and Tom had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a letter from twenty
miles off, saying how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was prospering in the world and had got
an overlooker's place; secondly, that Sam Phillips, who sawed with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>), had learned to read when he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) was turned twenty, and what
could be done by a little fellow like Sam Phillips, Bill considered,
could be done by himself, seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) could pound Sam into
wet clay if circumstances required it. So here he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) was, pointing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)
big finger towards three words at once, and turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) head on
one side that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) might keep better hold with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) eye of the one
word which was to be discriminated out of the group. The amount
of knowledge Bartle Massey must possess was something so dim
and vast that Bill's imagination recoiled before it: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) would hardly
have ventured to deny that the schoolmaster might have
something to do in bringing about the regular return of daylight
and the changes in the weather.
The man seated next to Bill was of a very different type: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) was



<p/>308

<p/>a Methodist brickmaker who, after spending thirty years of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) life
in perfect satisfaction with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) ignorance, had lately <div class="bookquote">``got religion,''
 (<font color='red'><b>a brickmaker</b></font>)</div>and along with it the desire to read the Bible. But with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>), too,
learning was a heavy business, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) way out to-night he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) had
offered as usual a special prayer for help, seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) had
undertaken this hard task with a single eye to the nourishment of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) soul--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) might have a greater abundance of texts and
hymns wherewith to banish evil memories and the temptations of
old habit--or, in brief language, the devil. For the brickmaker had
been a notorious poacher, and was suspected, though there was no
good evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>poacher</b></font>), of being the man who had shot a
neighbouring gamekeeper in the leg. However that might be, it is
certain that shortly after the accident referred to, which was
coincident with the arrival of an awakening Methodist preacher at
Treddleston, a great change had been observed in the brickmaker;
and though he (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) was still known in the neighbourhood by his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) old
sobriquet of <div class="bookquote">``Brimstone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>there was nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) held in so much
horror as any further transactions with that evil-smelling element.
He (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) was a broad-chested fellow. with a fervid temperament, which
helped him (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) better in imbibing religious ideas than in the dry
process of acquiring the mere human knowledge of the alphabet.
Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) had been already a little shaken in his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) resolution by a
brother Methodist, who assured him (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) that the letter was a mere
obstruction to the Spirit, and expressed a fear that Brimstone was
too eager for the knowledge that puffeth up.
The third beginner was a much more promising pupil. He (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) was a
tall but thin and wiry man, nearly as old as Brimstone, with a very
pale face and hands stained a deep blue. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a dyer, who in the
course of dipping homespun wool and old women's petticoats had



<p/>309

<p/>got fired with the ambition to learn a great deal more about the
strange secrets of colour. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had already a high reputation in the
district for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dyes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was bent on discovering some method
by which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could reduce the expense of crimsons and scarlets.
The druggist at Treddleston had given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a notion that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might
save himself a great deal of labour and expense if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could learn to
read, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had begun to give his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spare hours to the nightschool, resolving that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``little chap''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>should lose no time in
coming to Mr. Massey's day-school as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was old enough.
It was touching to see these three big men, with the marks of
their hard labour about them, anxiously bending over the worn
books and painfully making out, <div class="bookquote">``The grass is green,''  (<font color='red'><b>these men</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The sticks
are dry,''  (<font color='red'><b>these men</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The corn is ripe'' (<font color='red'><b>these men</b></font>)</div>--a very hard lesson to pass to after
columns of single words all alike except in the first letter. It was
almost as if three rough animals were making humble efforts to
learn how they might become human. And it touched the
tenderest fibre in Bartle Massey's nature, for such full-grown
children as these were the only pupils for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) had no severe
epithets and no impatient tones. He (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) was not gifted with an
imperturbable temper, and on music-nights it was apparent that
patience could never be an easy virtue to him (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>); but this evening, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) glances over his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) spectacles at Bill Downes, the sawyer, who is
turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) head on one side with a desperate sense of blankness
before the letters d, r, y, his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) eyes shed their mildest and most
encouraging light.
After the reading class, two youths between sixteen and
nineteen came up with the imaginary bills of parcels, which they
had been writing out on their slates and were now required to
calculate <div class="bookquote">``off-hand'' (<font color='red'><b>youths</b></font>)</div>--a test which they stood with such imperfect



<p/>310

<p/>success that Bartle Massey, whose eyes had been glaring at them
ominously through his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) spectacles for some minutes, at length
burst out in a bitter, high-pitched tone, pausing between every
sentence to rap the floor with a knobbed stick which rested
between his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) legs.
``Now, you see, you don't do this thing a bit better than you did
a fortnight ago, and I'll tell you what's the reason. You want to
learn accounts--that's well and good. But you think all you need
do to learn accounts is to come to me and do sums for an hour or
so, two or three times a-week; and no sooner do you get your caps
on and turn out of doors again than you sweep the whole thing
clean out of your mind. You go whistling about, and take no more
care what you're thinking of than if your heads were gutters for
any rubbish to swill through that happened to be in the way; and if
you get a good notion in ’em, it's pretty soon washed out again.
You think knowledge is to be got cheap--you'll come and pay
Bartle Massey sixpence a-week, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>)'ll make you clever at
figures without your taking any trouble. But knowledge isn't to be
got with paying sixpence, let me tell you. If you're to know figures,
you must turn ’em over in your heads and keep your thoughts
fixed on ’em. There's nothing you can't turn into a sum, for there's
nothing but what's got number in it--even a fool. You may say to
yourselves, `I'm one fool, and Jack's another; if my fool's head
weighed four pound, and Jack's three pound three ounces and
three quarters, how many pennyweights heavier would my head
be than Jack's?' A man that had got his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart in learning figures
would make sums for himself and work ’em in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
sat at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoemaking, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d count his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stitches by fives, and then
put a price on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stitches, say half a farthing, and then see how



<p/>311

<p/>much money he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could get in an hour; and then ask himself how
much money he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d get in a day at that rate; and then how much ten
workmen would get working three, or twenty, or a hundred years
at that rate--and all the while his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needle would be going just as
fast as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head empty for the devil to dance in. But the
long and the short of it is--I'll have nobody in my night-school that
doesn't strive to learn what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comes to learn, as hard as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
striving to get out of a dark hole into broad daylight. I'll send no
man away because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s stupid: if Billy Taft, the idiot, wanted to
learn anything, I'd not refuse to teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Taft</b></font>). But I'll not throw away
good knowledge on people who think they can get it by the
sixpenn'orth, and carry it away with ’em as they would an ounce of
snuff. So never come to me again, if you can't show that you've
been working with your own heads, instead of thinking that you
can pay for mine to work for you. That's the last word I've got to
say to you.''
With this final sentence, Bartle Massey gave a sharper rap than
ever with his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) knobbed stick, and the discomfited lads got up to go
with a sulky look. The other pupils had happily only their writingbooks to show, in various stages of progress from pot-hooks to
round text; and mere pen-strokes, however perverse, were less
exasperating to Bartle than false arithmetic. He (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) was a little more
severe than usual on Jacob Storey's Z's, of which poor Jacob had
written a pageful, all with their tops turned the wrong way, with a
puzzled sense that they were not right ``somehow.'' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)
observed in apology, that it was a letter you never wanted hardly,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) thought it had only been there <div class="bookquote">``to finish off th' alphabet,
like, though ampus-and -LRB-&-RRB- would ha' done as well, for what he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
could see.''



 (<font color='red'><b>the pupils</b></font>)</div><p/>312

<p/>At last the pupils had all taken their hats and said their <div class="bookquote">``Goodnights,''  (<font color='red'><b>the pupils</b></font>)</div>and Adam, knowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) old master's habits, rose and said,
<div class="bookquote">``Shall I put the candles out, Mr. Massey?''
 (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my boy, yes, all but this, which I'll carry into the house;
and just lock the outer door, now you're near it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div>said Bartle,
getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) stick in the fitting angle to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) in descending from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) stool. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) was no sooner on the ground than it became obvious
why the stick was necessary--the left leg was much shorter than
the right. But the school-master was so active with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) lameness
that it was hardly thought of as a misfortune; and if you had seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) make his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) way along the schoolroom floor, and up the step into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) kitchen, you would perhaps have understood why the naughty
boys sometimes felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) pace might be indefinitely quickened
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) stick might overtake them even in their
swiftest run.
The moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) appeared at the kitchen door with the candle in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) hand, a faint whimpering began in the chimney-corner, and a
brown-and-tan-coloured bitch, of that wise-looking breed with
short legs and long body, known to an unmechanical generation as
turn-spits, came creeping along the floor, wagging her (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>) tail, and
hesitating at every other step, as if her (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>) affections were painfully
divided between the hamper in the chimney-corner and the
master, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>) could not leave without a greeting.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, Vixen, well then, how are the babbies?''  (<font color='red'><b>the schoolmaster</b></font>)</div>said the
schoolmaster, making haste towards the chimney-corner and
holding the candle over the low hamper, where two extremely
blind puppies lifted up their heads towards the light from a nest of
flannel and wool. Vixen could not even see her (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>) master look at
them without painful excitement: she (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>) got into the hamper and got



<p/>313

<p/>out again the next moment, and behaved with true feminine folly,
though looking all the while as wise as a dwarf with a large oldfashioned head and body on the most abbreviated legs.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, you've got a family, I see, Mr. Massey?''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam,
smiling, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) came into the kitchen. <div class="bookquote">``How's that? I thought it was
against the law here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Law? What's the use o' law when a man's once such a fool as
to let a woman into his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) house?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div>said Bartle, turning away from the
hamper with some bitterness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) always called Vixen a woman,
and seemed to have lost all consciousness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) was using a
figure of speech. <div class="bookquote">``If I'd known Vixen was a woman, I'd never have
held the boys from drowning her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); but when I'd got her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) into my
hand, I was forced to take to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). And now you see what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s
brought me to--the sly, hypocritical wench'' (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div>--Bartle spoke these
last words in a rasping tone of reproach, and looked at Vixen, who
poked down her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head and turned up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) with a
keen sense of opprobrium--<div class="bookquote">``and contrived to be brought to bed
on a Sunday at church-time. I've wished again and again I'd been
a bloody minded man, that I could have strangled the mother and
the brats with one cord.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad it was no worse a cause kept you from church,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said
Adam. <div class="bookquote">``I was afraid you must be ill for the first time i' your life.
And I was particularly sorry not to have you at church yesterday.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my boy, I know why, I know why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Bartle kindly,
going up to Adam and raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hand up to the shoulder that was
almost on a level with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) own head. ``You've had a rough bit o'
road to get over since I saw you--a rough bit o' road. But I'm in
hopes there are better times coming for you. I've got some news to
tell you. But I must get my supper first, for I'm hungry, I'm



<p/>314

<p/>hungry. Sit down, sit down.''
Bartle went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) little pantry, and brought out an excellent
home-baked loaf; for it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) one extravagance in these dear
times to eat bread once a-day instead of oat-cake; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) justified
it by observing, that what a schoolmaster wanted was brains, and
oat-cake ran too much to bone instead of brains. Then came a
piece of cheese and a quart jug with a crown of foam upon it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>)
placed them all on the round deal table which stood against his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>)
large arm-chair in the chimney-corner, with Vixen's hamper on
one side of it and a window-shelf with a few books piled up in it on
the other. The table was as clean as if Vixen had been an excellent
housewife in a checkered apron; so was the quarry floor; and the
old carved oaken press, table, and chairs, which in these days
would be bought at a high price in aristocratic houses, though, in
that period of spider-legs and inlaid cupids, Bartle had got them
for an old song, where as free from dust as things could be at the
end of a summer's day.
``Now, then, my boy, draw up, draw up. We'll not talk about
business till we've had our supper. No man can be wise on an
empty stomach. But,'' said Bartle, rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) chair again, ``I
must give Vixen her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) supper too, confound her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)! Though she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll do
nothing with it but nourish those unnecessary babbies. That's the
way with these women--they've got no head-pieces to nourish,
and so their food all runs either to fat or to brats.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) brought out of the pantry a dish of scraps, which Vixen at
once fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) eyes on, and jumped out of her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) hamper to lick up
with the utmost dispatch.
``I've had my supper, Mr. Massey,'' said Adam, ``so I'll look on
while you eat yours. I've been at the Hall Farm, and they always



<p/>315

<p/>have their supper betimes, you know: they don't keep your late
hours.''
``I know little about their hours,'' said Bartle dryly, cutting his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>)
bread and not shrinking from the crust. ``It's a house I seldom go
into, though I'm fond of the boys, and Martin Poyser's a good
fellow. There's too many women in the house for me: I hate the
sound of women's voices; they're always either a-buzz or asqueak--always either a-buzz or a-squeak. Mrs. Poyser keeps at
the top o' the talk like a fife; and as for the young lasses, I'd as
soon look at water-grubs. I know what they'll turn to--stinging
gnats, stinging gnats. Here, take some ale, my boy: it's been drawn
for you--it's been drawn for you.''
``Nay, Mr. Massey,'' said Adam, who took his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) old friend's whim
more seriously than usual to-night, ``don't be so hard on the
creaturs God has made to be companions for us. A working-man
'ud be badly off without a wife to see to th' house and the victual,
and make things clean and comfortable.''
<div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! It's the silliest lie a sensible man like you ever
believed, to say a woman makes a house comfortable. It's a story
got up because the women are there and something must be found
for ’em to do. I tell you there isn't a thing under the sun that needs
to be done at all, but what a man can do better than a woman,
unless it's bearing children, and they do that in a poor make-shift
way; it had better ha' been left to the men--it had better ha' been
left to the men. I tell you, a woman 'ull bake you a pie every week
of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life and never come to see that the hotter th' oven the
shorter the time. I tell you, a woman 'ull make your porridge every
day for twenty years and never think of measuring the proportion
between the meal and the milk--a little more or less, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll think,



<p/>316

<p/>doesn't signify. The porridge will be awk'ard now and then: if it's
wrong, it's summat in the meal, or it's summat in the milk, or it's
summat in the water. Look at me! I make my own bread, and
there's no difference between one batch and another from year's
end to year's end; but if I'd got any other woman besides Vixen in
the house, I must pray to the Lord every baking to give me
patience if the bread turned out heavy. And as for cleanliness, my
house is cleaner than any other house on the Common, though the
half of ’em swarm with women. Will Baker's lad comes to help me
in a morning, and we get as much cleaning done in one hour,
without any fuss, as a woman 'ud get done in three, and all the
while be sending buckets o' water after your ankles, and let the
fender and the fire-irons stand in the middle o' the floor half the
day for you to break your shins against ’em. Don't tell me about
God having made such creatures to be companions for us! I don't
say but He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) might make Eve to be a companion to Adam in
Paradise--there was no cooking to be spoilt there, and no other
woman to cackle with and make mischief, though you see what
mischief she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d an opportunity. But it's an
impious, unscriptural opinion to say a woman's a blessing to a
man now; you might as well say adders and wasps, and foxes and
wild beasts are a blessing, when they're only the evils that belong
to this state o' probation, which it's lawful for a man to keep as
clear of as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can in this life, hoping to get quit of ’em for ever in
another--hoping to get quit of ’em for ever in another.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Bartle had become so excited and angry in the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>)
invective that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) had forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) supper, and only used the knife
for the purpose of rapping the table with the haft. But towards the
close, the raps became so sharp and frequent, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) voice so



<p/>317

<p/>quarrelsome, that Vixen felt it incumbent on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) to jump out of the
hamper and bark vaguely.
<div class="bookquote">``Quiet, Vixen!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div>snarled Bartle, turning round upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``You're like the rest o' the women--always putting in your word
before you know why.''
 (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>Vixen returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) hamper again in humiliation, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>)
master continued his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) supper in a silence which Adam did not
choose to interrupt; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) knew the old man would be in a better
humour when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) supper and lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pipe. Adam
was used to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) talk in this way, but had never learned so
much of Bartle's past life as to know whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) view of married
comfort was founded on experience. On that point Bartle was
mute, and it was even a secret where he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) had lived previous to the
twenty years in which happily for the peasants and artisans of this
neighbourhood he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) had been settled among them as their only
schoolmaster. If anything like a question was ventured on this
subject, Bartle always replied, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I've seen many places--I've
been a deal in the south,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div>and the Loamshire men would as soon

in <div class="bookquote">``the south.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Loamshire men</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now then, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div>said Bartle, at last, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) had poured
out his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) second mug of ale and lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) pipe, <div class="bookquote">``now then, we'll
have a little talk. But tell me first, have you heard any particular
news to-day?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, <div class="bookquote">``not as I remember.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, they'll keep it close, they'll keep it close, I daresay. But I
found it out by chance; and it's news that may concern you, Adam,
else I'm a man that don't know a superficial square foot from a
solid.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div><p/>318

<p/>Here Bartle gave a series of fierce and rapid puffs, looking
earnestly the while at Adam. Your impatient loquacious man has
never any notion of keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pipe alight by gentle measured
puffs; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is always letting it go nearly out, and then punishing it
for that negligence. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Satchell's got a paralytic
stroke. I found it out from the lad they sent to Treddleston for the
doctor, before seven o’clock this morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s a good way beyond
sixty, you know; it's much if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) gets over it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, <div class="bookquote">``I daresay there'd be more rejoicing than
sorrow in the parish at his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) being laid up. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s been a selfish, talebearing, mischievous fellow; but, after all, there's nobody he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s
done so much harm to as to th' old squire. Though it's the squire
himself as is to blame--making a stupid fellow like that a sort o'
man-of-all-work, just to save th' expense of having a proper
steward to look after th' estate. And he (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>)'s lost more by ill
management o' the woods, I'll be bound, than 'ud pay for two
stewards. If he (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>)'s laid on the shelf, it's to be hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>)'ll make way
for a better man, but I don't see how it's like to make any
difference to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But I see it, but I see it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div>said Bartle, ``and others besides me.
The captain's coming of age now--you know that as well as I do--
and it's to be expected he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'ll have a little more voice in things. And
I know, and you know too, what 'ud be the captain's wish about
the woods, if there was a fair opportunity for making a change.
He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'s said in plenty of people's hearing that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'d make you
manager of the woods to-morrow, if he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'d the power. Why, Carroll,
Mr. Irwine's butler, heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Carroll</b></font>) say so to the parson not many days
ago. Carroll looked in when we were smoking our pipes o'
Saturday night at Casson's, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) told us about it; and whenever



<p/>319

<p/>anybody says a good word for you, the parson's ready to back it,
that I'll answer for. It was pretty well talked over, I can tell you, at
Casson's, and one and another had their fling at you; for if
donkeys set to work to sing, you're pretty sure what the tune'll
be.''
``Why, did they talk it over before Mr. Burge?'' said Adam; ``or
wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) there o' Saturday?''
``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) went away before Carroll came; and Casson--he (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>)'s
always for setting other folks right, you know--would have it
Burge was the man to have the management of the woods. `A
substantial man,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), `with pretty near sixty years' experience
o' timber: it 'ud be all very well for Adam Bede to act under him (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>),
but it isn't to be supposed the squire 'ud appoint a young fellow
like Adam, when there's his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) elders and betters at hand!' But I said,
`That's a pretty notion o' yours, Casson. Why, Burge is the man to
buy timber; would you put the woods into his (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) hands and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>)
make his (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) own bargains? I think you don't leave your customers to
score their own drink, do you? And as for age, what that's worth
depends on the quality o' the liquor. It's pretty well known who's
the backbone of Jonathan Burge's business.'''
<div class="bookquote">``I thank you for your good word, Mr. Massey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam.
<div class="bookquote">``But, for all that, Casson was partly i' the right for once. There's
not much likelihood that th' old squire 'ud ever consent t' employ
me. I offended him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) about two years ago, and he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>)'s never forgiven
me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, how was that? You never told me about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div>said Bartle.
``Oh, it was a bit o' nonsense. I'd made a frame for a screen for
Miss Lyddy--she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s allays making something with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) worstedwork, you know--and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'d given me particular orders about this



<p/>320

<p/>screen, and there was as much talking and measuring as if we'd
been planning a house. However, it was a nice bit o' work, and I
liked doing it for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). But, you know, those little friggling things
take a deal o' time. I only worked at it in over-hours--often late at
night--and I had to go to Treddleston over an' over again about
little bits o' brass nails and such gear; and I turned the little knobs
and the legs, and carved th' open work, after a pattern, as nice as
could be. And I was uncommon pleased with it when it was done.
And when I took it home, Miss Lyddy sent for me to bring it into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>) drawing-room, so as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>) might give me directions about
fastening on the work--very fine needlework, Jacob and Rachel akissing one another among the sheep, like a picture--and th' old
squire was sitting there, for he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) mostly sits with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>). Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) was
mighty pleased with the screen, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) wanted to know
what pay she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) was to give me. I didn't speak at random--you know
it's not my way; I'd calculated pretty close, though I hadn't made
out a bill, and I said, `One pound thirty.' That was paying for the
mater'als and paying me, but none too much, for my work. Th' old
squire looked up at this, and peered in his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) way at the screen, and
said, `One pound thirteen for a gimcrack like that! Lydia, my dear,
if you must spend money on these things, why don't you get them
at Rosseter, instead of paying double price for clumsy work here?
Such things are not work for a carpenter like Adam. Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) a
guinea, and no more.' Well, Miss Lyddy, I reckon, believed what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>)'s not over-fond o' parting with the money
herself--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>)'s not a bad woman at bottom, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>)'s been brought
up under his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thumb; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>) began fidgeting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>) purse, and
turned as red as her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>) ribbon. But I made a bow, and said, `No,
thank you, madam; I'll make you a present o' the screen, if you



<p/>321

<p/>please. I've charged the regular price for my work, and I know it's
done well; and I know, begging His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) Honour's pardon, that you
couldn't get such a screen at Rosseter under two guineas. I'm
willing to give you my work--it's been done in my own time, and
nobody's got anything to do with it but me; but if I'm paid, I can't
take a smaller price than I asked, because that 'ud be like saying
I'd asked more than was just. With your leave, madam, I'll bid you
good-morning.' I made my bow and went out before she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)'d time to
say any more, for she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) stood with the purse in her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) hand, looking
almost foolish. I didn't mean to be disrespectful, and I spoke as
polite as I could; but I can give in to no man, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants to make it
out as I'm trying to overreach him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). And in the evening the footman
brought me the one pound thirteen wrapped in paper. But since
then I've seen pretty clear as th' old squire can't abide me.''
``That's likely enough, that's likely enough,'' said Bartle
meditatively. ``The only way to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) round would be to show
him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) what was for his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) own interest, and that the captain may do--
that the captain may do.''
``Nay, I don't know,'' said Adam; <div class="bookquote">``the squire's 'cute enough but
it takes something else besides 'cuteness to make folks see what'll
be their interest in the long run. It takes some conscience and
belief in right and wrong, I see that pretty clear. You'd hardly ever
bring round th' old squire to believe he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>)'d gain as much in a
straightfor'ard way as by tricks and turns. And, besides, I've not
much mind to work under him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>): I don't want to quarrel with any
gentleman, more particular an old gentleman turned eighty, and I
know we couldn't agree long. If the captain was master o' th'
estate, it 'ud be different: he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'s got a conscience and a will to do
right, and I'd sooner work for him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) nor for any man living.''



 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>322

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, my boy, if good luck knocks at your door, don't you
put your head out at window and tell it to be gone about its
business, that's all. You must learn to deal with odd and even in
life, as well as in figures. I tell you now, as I told you ten years ago,
when you pommelled young Mike Holdsworth for wanting to pass
a bad shilling before you knew whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Holdsworth</b></font>) was in jest or earnest--
you're over-hasty and proud, and apt to set your teeth against
folks that don't square to your notions. It's no harm for me to be a
bit fiery and stiff-backed--I'm an old schoolmaster, and shall
never want to get on to a higher perch. But where's the use of all
the time I've spent in teaching you writing and mapping and
mensuration, if you're not to get for'ard in the world and show
folks there's some advantage in having a head on your shoulders,
instead of a turnip? Do you mean to go on turning up your nose at
every opportunity because it's got a bit of a smell about it that
nobody finds out but yourself? It's as foolish as that notion o'
yours that a wife is to make a working-man comfortable. Stuff and
nonsense! Stuff and nonsense! Leave that to fools that never got
beyond a sum in simple addition. Simple addition enough! Add
one fool to another fool, and in six years' time six fools more--
they're all of the same denomination, big and little's nothing to do
with the sum!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div>During this rather heated exhortation to coolness and
discretion the pipe had gone out, and Bartle gave the climax to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>)
speech by striking a light furiously, after which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) puffed with
fierce resolution, fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) eye still on Adam, who was trying not
to laugh.
<div class="bookquote">``There's a good deal o' sense in what you say, Mr. Massey,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam began, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) felt quite serious, ``as there always is.



<p/>323

<p/>But you'll give in that it's no business o' mine to be building on
chances that may never happen. What I've got to do is to work as
well as I can with the tools and mater'als I've got in my hands. If a
good chance comes to me, I'll think o' what you've been saying;
but till then, I've got nothing to do but to trust to my own hands
and my own head-piece. I'm turning over a little plan for Seth and
me to go into the cabinet-making a bit by ourselves, and win a
extra pound or two in that way. But it's getting late now--it'll be
pretty near eleven before I'm at home, and Mother may happen to
lie awake; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s more fidgety nor usual now. So I'll bid you goodnight.''
``Well, well, we'll go to the gate with you--it's a fine night,'' said
Bartle, taking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) stick. Vixen was at once on her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) legs, and
without further words the three walked out into the starlight, by
the side of Bartle's potato-beds, to the little gate.
``Come to the music o' Friday night, if you can, my boy,'' said
the old man, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) closed the gate after Adam and leaned against
it.
``Aye, aye,'' said Adam, striding along towards the streak of pale
road. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was the only object moving on the wide common. The
two grey donkeys, just visible in front of the gorse bushes, stood as
still as limestone images--as still as the grey-thatched roof of the
mud cottage a little farther on. Bartle kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) eye on the moving
figure till it passed into the darkness, while Vixen, in a state of
divided affection, had twice run back to the house to bestow a
parenthetic lick on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) puppies.
``Aye, aye,'' muttered the schoolmaster, as Adam disappeared,
``there you go, stalking along--stalking along; but you wouldn't
have been what you are if you hadn't had a bit of old lame Bartle



<p/>324

<p/>inside you. The strongest calf must have something to suck at.
There's plenty of these big, lumbering fellows 'ud never have
known their A B C, if it hadn't been for Bartle Massey. Well, well,
Vixen, you foolish wench, what is it, what is it? I must go in, must
I? Aye, aye, I'm never to have a will o' my own any more. And
those pups--what do you think I'm to do with ’em, when they're
twice as big as you? For I'm pretty sure the father was that
hulking bull-terrier of Will Baker's--wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) now, eh, you sly
hussy?'' -LRB-Here Vixen tucked her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) tail between her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) legs and ran
forward into the house. Subjects are sometimes broached which a

``But where's the use of talking to a woman with babbies?''
continued Bartle. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s got no conscience--no conscience; it's all

<p/>Chapter XXII
Going to the Birthday Feast

<p/>T

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thirtieth of July was come, and it was one of those halfdozen warm days which sometimes occur in the middle of
a rainy English summer. No rain had fallen for the last
three or four days, and the weather was perfect for that time of the
year: there was less dust than usual on the dark-green hedge-rows
and on the wild camomile that starred the roadside, yet the grass
was dry enough for the little children to roll on it, and there was
no cloud but a long dash of light, downy ripple, high, high up in
the far-off blue sky. Perfect weather for an outdoor July merrymaking, yet surely not the best time of year to be born in. Nature
seems to make a hot pause just then: all the loveliest flowers are
gone; the sweet time of early growth and vague hopes is past; and
yet the time of harvest and ingathering is not come, and we
tremble at the possible storms that may ruin the precious fruit in
the moment of its ripeness. The woods are all one dark
monotonous green; the waggon-loads of hay no longer creep along
the lanes, scattering their sweet-smelling fragments on the
blackberry branches; the pastures are often a little tanned, yet the
corn has not got its last splendour of red and gold; the lambs and
calves have lost all traces of their innocent frisky prettiness, and
have become stupid young sheep and cows. But it is a time of
leisure on the farm--that pause between hay and corn-harvest,
and so the farmers and labourers in Hayslope and Broxton
thought the captain did well to come of age just then, when they




<p/>327

<p/>could give their undivided minds to the flavour of the great cask of
ale which had been brewed the autumn after <div class="bookquote">``the heir''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>was born,
and was to be tapped on his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) twenty-first birthday. The air had
been merry with the ringing of church-bells very early this
morning, and every one had made haste to get through the needful
work before twelve, when it would be time to think of getting
ready to go to the Chase.
The midday sun was streaming into Hetty's bedchamber, and
there was no blind to temper the heat with which it fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
head as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) looked at herself in the old specked glass. Still, that
was the only glass she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) neck and
arms, for the small hanging glass she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had fetched out of the next
room--the room that had been Dinah's--would show her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) nothing
below her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) little chin; and that beautiful bit of neck where the
roundness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) cheek melted into another roundness shadowed
by dark delicate curls. And to-day she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) thought more than usual
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) neck and arms; for at the dance this evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was not
to wear any neckerchief, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had been busy yesterday with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) spotted pink-and-white frock, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) might make the sleeves
either long or short at will. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was dressed now just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was to
be in the evening, with a tucker made of <div class="bookquote">``real''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>lace, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
aunt had lent her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) for this unparalleled occasion, but with no
ornaments besides; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had even taken out her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) small round earrings which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) wore every day. But there was something more to
be done, apparently, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) neckerchief and long
sleeves, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was to wear in the day-time, for now she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
unlocked the drawer that held her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) private treasures. It is more
than a month since we saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) unlock that drawer before, and
now it holds new treasures, so much more precious than the old



<p/>328

<p/>ones that these are thrust into the corner. Hetty would not care to
put the large coloured glass ear-rings into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) ears now; for see!
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) has got a beautiful pair of gold and pearls and garnet, lying
snugly in a pretty little box lined with white satin. Oh, the delight
of taking out that little box and looking at the ear-rings! Do not
reason about it, my philosophical reader, and say that Hetty, being
very pretty, must have known that it did not signify whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
had on any ornaments or not; and that, moreover, to look at earrings which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could not possibly wear out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) bedroom could
hardly be a satisfaction, the essence of vanity being a reference to
the impressions produced on others; you will never understand
women's natures if you are so excessively rational. Try rather to
divest yourself of all your rational prejudices, as much as if you
were studying the psychology of a canary bird, and only watch the
movements of this pretty round creature as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) turns her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) head on
one side with an unconscious smile at the ear-rings nestled in the
little box. Ah, you think, it is for the sake of the person who has
given them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thoughts are gone back now to the
moment when they were put into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hands. No; else why should
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) have cared to have ear-rings rather than anything else? And I
know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had longed for ear-rings from among all the
ornaments she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could imagine.
<div class="bookquote">``Little, little ears!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>Arthur had said, pretending to pinch them
one evening, as Hetty sat beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) on the grass without her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hat.
<div class="bookquote">``I wish I had some pretty ear-rings!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said in a moment, almost
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was saying--the wish lay so close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
lips, it would flutter past them at the slightest breath. And the next
day--it was only last week--Arthur had ridden over to Rosseter on
purpose to buy them. That little wish so naïvely uttered seemed to



<p/>329

<p/>him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) the prettiest bit of childishness; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had never heard anything
like it before; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had wrapped the box up in a great many
covers, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) might see Hetty unwrapping it with growing
curiosity, till at last her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eyes flashed back their new delight into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).
No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was not thinking most of the giver when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) smiled at
the ear-rings, for now she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) is taking them out of the box, not to
press them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) lips, but to fasten them in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) ears--only for one
moment, to see how pretty they look, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) peeps at them in the
glass against the wall, with first one position of the head and then
another, like a listening bird. It is impossible to be wise on the
subject of ear-rings as one looks at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>); what should those delicate
pearls and crystals be made for, if not for such ears? One cannot
even find fault with the tiny round hole which they leave when
they are taken out; perhaps water-nixies, and such lovely things
without souls, have these little round holes in their ears by nature,
ready to hang jewels in. And Hetty must be one of them: it is too
painful to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) is a woman, with a woman's destiny
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)--a woman spinning in young ignorance a light web of
folly and vain hopes which may one day close round her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and press
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), a rancorous poisoned garment, changing all at once her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
fluttering, trivial butterfly sensations into a life of deep human
anguish.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cannot keep in the ear-rings long, else she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) may make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) uncle and aunt wait. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) puts them quickly into the box again
and shuts them up. Some day she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) will be able to wear any earrings she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) likes, and already she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) lives in an invisible world of
brilliant costumes, shimmering gauze, soft satin, and velvet, such
as the lady's maid at the Chase has shown her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) in Miss Lydia's



<p/>330

<p/>wardrobe. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) feels the bracelets on her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) arms, and treads on a soft
carpet in front of a tall mirror. But she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) has one thing in the drawer
which she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) can venture to wear to-day, because she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) can hang it on
the chain of dark-brown berries which she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) has been used to wear
on grand days, with a tiny flat scent-bottle at the end of it tucked
inside her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) frock; and she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) must put on her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) brown berries--her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) neck
would look so unfinished without it. Hetty was not quite as fond of
the locket as of the ear-rings, though it was a handsome large
locket, with enamelled flowers at the back and a beautiful gold
border round the glass, which showed a light-brown slightly
waving lock, forming a background for two little dark rings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
must keep it under her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) clothes, and no one would see it. But Hetty
had another passion, only a little less strong than her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) love of
finery, and that other passion made her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) like to wear the locket
even hidden in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) bosom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would always have worn it, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
had dared to encounter her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt's questions about a ribbon round
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) neck. So now she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) slipped it on along her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) chain of dark-brown
berries, and snapped the chain round her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) neck. It was not a very
long chain, only allowing the locket to hang a little way below the
edge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) frock. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had nothing to do but to put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
long sleeves, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) new white gauze neckerchief, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) straw hat
trimmed with white to-day instead of the pink, which had become
rather faded under the July sun. That hat made the drop of
bitterness in Hetty's cup to-day, for it was not quite new--
everybody would see that it was a little tanned against the white
ribbon--and Mary Burge, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt sure, would have a new hat or
bonnet on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) looked for consolation at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) fine white cotton
stockings: they really were very nice indeed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had given
almost all her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) spare money for them. Hetty's dream of the future



<p/>331

<p/>could not make her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) insensible to triumph in the present. To be
sure, Captain Donnithorne loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) would never care
about looking at other people, but then those other people didn't
know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was not satisfied to appear
shabby and insignificant in their eyes even for a short space.
The whole party was assembled in the house-place when Hetty
went down, all of course in their Sunday clothes; and the bells had
been ringing so this morning in honour of the captain's twentyfirst birthday, and the work had all been got done so early, that
Marty and Tommy were not quite easy in their minds until their
mother had assured them that going to church was not part of the
day's festivities. Mr. Poyser had once suggested that the house
should be shut up and left to take care of itself; <div class="bookquote">``for,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``there's no danger of anybody's breaking in--everybody'll be at
the Chase, thieves an' all. If we lock th' house up, all the men can
go: it's a day they wonna see twice i' their lives.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But Mrs. Poyser
answered with great decision: <div class="bookquote">``I never left the house to take care
of itself since I was a missis, and I never will. There's been illlooking tramps enoo' about the place this last week, to carry off
every ham an' every spoon we’n got; and they all collogue
together, them tramps, as it's a mercy they hanna come and
poisoned the dogs and murdered us all in our beds afore we
knowed, some Friday night when we’n got the money in th' house
to pay the men. And it's like enough the tramps know where we're
going as well as we do oursens; for if Old Harry wants any work
done, you may be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'ll find the means.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense about murdering us in our beds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser;
``I've got a gun i' our room, hanna I? and thee 'st got ears as 'ud
find it out if a mouse was gnawing the bacon. Howiver, if thee



<p/>332

<p/>wouldstna be easy, Alick can stay at home i' the forepart o' the
day, and Tim can come back tow'rds five o’clock, and let Alick
have his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) turn. They may let Growler loose if anybody offers to do
mischief, and there's Alick's dog too, ready enough to set his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) tooth
in a tramp if Alick gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) a wink.''
Mrs. Poyser accepted this compromise, but thought it advisable
to bar and bolt to the utmost; and now, at the last moment before
starting, Nancy, the dairy-maid, was closing the shutters of the
house-place, although the window, lying under the immediate
observation of Alick and the dogs, might have been supposed the
least likely to be selected for a burglarious attempt.
The covered cart, without springs, was standing ready to carry
the whole family except the men-servants. Mr. Poyser and the
grandfather sat on the seat in front, and within there was room for
all the women and children; the fuller the cart the better, because
then the jolting would not hurt so much, and Nancy's broad
person and thick arms were an excellent cushion to be pitched on.
But Mr. Poyser drove at no more than a walking pace, that there
might be as little risk of jolting as possible on this warm day, and
there was time to exchange greetings and remarks with the footpassengers who were going the same way, specking the paths
between the green meadows and the golden cornfields with bits of
movable bright colour--a scarlet waistcoat to match the poppies
that nodded a little too thickly among the corn, or a dark-blue
neckerchief with ends flaunting across a brand-new white smockfrock. All Broxton and all Hayslope were to be at the Chase, and
make merry there in honour of <div class="bookquote">``th' heir'' (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>; and the old men and
women, who had never been so far down this side of the hill for
the last twenty years, were being brought from Broxton and



<p/>333

<p/>Hayslope in one of the farmer's waggons, at Mr. Irwine's
suggestion. The church-bells had struck up again now--a last
tune, before the ringers came down the hill to have their share in
the festival; and before the bells had finished, other music was
heard approaching, so that even Old Brown, the sober horse that
was drawing Mr. Poyser's cart, began to prick up his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) ears. It was
the band of the Benefit Club, which had mustered in all its glory--
that is to say, in bright-blue scarfs and blue favours, and carrying
its banner with the motto, <div class="bookquote">``Let brotherly love continue,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>encircling a picture of a stone-pit.
The carts, of course, were not to enter the Chase. Every one
must get down at the lodges, and the vehicles must be sent back.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, the Chase is like a fair a'ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
got down from the cart, and saw the groups scattered under the
great oaks, and the boys running about in the hot sunshine to
survey the tall poles surmounted by the fluttering garments that
were to be the prize of the successful climbers. <div class="bookquote">``I should ha'
thought there wasna so many people i' the two parishes. Mercy on
us! How hot it is out o' the shade! Come here, Totty, else your little
face 'ull be burnt to a scratchin'! They might ha' cooked the
dinners i' that open space an' saved the fires. I shall go to Mrs.
Best's room an' sit down.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Stop a bit, stop a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser. <div class="bookquote">``There's th' waggin
coming wi' th' old folks in't; it'll be such a sight as wonna come
o’er again, to see ’em get down an' walk along all together. You
remember some on ’em i' their prime, eh, Father?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin Poyser/Martin</b></font>)</div>said old Martin, walking slowly under the shade of
the lodge porch, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) could see the aged party descend.
``I remember Jacob Taft walking fifty mile after the Scotch



<p/>334

<p/>raybels, when they turned back from Stoniton.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) felt himself quite a youngster, with a long life before him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) saw the Hayslope patriarch, old Feyther Taft, descend from the
waggon and walk towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Taft</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>Taft</b></font>) brown nightcap, and leaning
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Taft</b></font>) two sticks.
``Well, Mester Taft,'' shouted old Martin, at the utmost stretch of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) voice--for though he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) knew the old man was stone deaf, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
could not omit the propriety of a greeting--``you're hearty yet. You
can enjoy yoursen to-day, for-all you're ninety an' better.''
<div class="bookquote">``Your sarvant, mesters, your sarvant,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Feyther Taft in a
treble tone, perceiving that he (<font color='blue'><b>Taft</b></font>) was in company.
The aged group, under care of sons or daughters, themselves
worn and grey, passed on along the least-winding carriage-road
towards the house, where a special table was prepared for them;
while the Poyser party wisely struck across the grass under the
shade of the great trees, but not out of view of the house-front,
with its sloping lawn and flower-beds, or of the pretty striped
marquee at the edge of the lawn, standing at right angles with two
larger marquees on each side of the open green space where the
games were to be played. The house would have been nothing but
a plain square mansion of Queen Anne's time, but for the remnant
of an old abbey to which it was united at one end, in much the
same way as one may sometimes see a new farmhouse rising high
and prim at the end of older and lower farm-offices. The fine old
remnant stood a little backward and under the shadow of tall
beeches, but the sun was now on the taller and more advanced
front, the blinds were all down, and the house seemed asleep in
the hot midday. It made Hetty quite sad to look at it: Arthur must
be somewhere in the back rooms, with the grand company, where



<p/>335

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could not possibly know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was come, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) should not
see him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) for a long, long while--not till after dinner, when they said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was to come up and make a speech.
But Hetty was wrong in part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) conjecture. No grand
company was come except the Irwines, for whom the carriage had
been sent early, and Arthur was at that moment not in a back
room, but walking with the rector into the broad stone cloisters of
the old abbey, where the long tables were laid for all the cottage
tenants and the farm-servants. A very handsome young Briton he (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>)
looked to-day, in high spirits and a bright-blue frock-coat, the
highest mode--his (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>) arm no longer in a sling. So open-looking and
candid, too; but candid people have their secrets, and secrets leave
no lines in young faces.
<div class="bookquote">``Upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>) said, as they entered the cool cloisters, <div class="bookquote">``I
think the cottagers have the best of it: these cloisters make a
delightful dining-room on a hot day. That was capital advice of
yours, Irwine, about the dinners--to let them be as orderly and
comfortable as possible, and only for the tenants: especially as I
had only a limited sum after all; for though my grandfather talked
of a carte blanche, he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) couldn't make up his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) mind to trust me, when
it came to the point.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, you'll give more pleasure in this quiet way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Irwine. ``In this sort of thing people are constantly
confounding liberality with riot and disorder. It sounds very grand
to say that so many sheep and oxen were roasted whole, and
everybody ate who liked to come; but in the end it generally
happens that no one has had an enjoyable meal. If the people get a
good dinner and a moderate quantity of ale in the middle of the
day, they'll be able to enjoy the games as the day cools. You can't



<p/>336

<p/>hinder some of them from getting too much towards evening, but
drunkenness and darkness go better together than drunkenness
and daylight.''
``Well, I hope there won't be much of it. I've kept the
Treddleston people away by having a feast for them in the town;
and I've got Casson and Adam Bede and some other good fellows
to look to the giving out of ale in the booths, and to take care
things don't go too far. Come, let us go up above now and see the
dinner-tables for the large tenants.''
They went up the stone staircase leading simply to the long
gallery above the cloisters, a gallery where all the dusty worthless
old pictures had been banished for the last three generations--
mouldy portraits of Queen Elizabeth and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) ladies, General Monk
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) eye knocked out, Daniel very much in the dark among the
lions, and Julius Caesar on horseback, with a high nose and laurel
crown, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) Commentaries in his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) hand.
``What a capital thing it is that they saved this piece of the old
abbey!'' said Arthur. ``If I'm ever master here, I shall do up the
gallery in first-rate style. We've got no room in the house a third as
large as this. That second table is for the farmers' wives and
children: Mrs. Best said it would be more comfortable for the
mothers and children to be by themselves. I was determined to
have the children, and make a regular family thing of it. I shall be
'the old squire' to those little lads and lasses some day, and they'll
tell their children what a much finer young fellow I was than my
own son. There's a table for the women and children below as
well. But you will see them all--you will come up with me after
dinner, I hope?''
``Yes, to be sure,'' said Mr. Irwine. ``I wouldn't miss your maiden



<p/>337

<p/>speech to the tenantry.''
``And there will be something else you'll like to hear,'' said
Arthur. ``Let us go into the library and I'll tell you all about it while
my grandfather is in the drawing-room with the ladies. Something
that will surprise you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) continued, as they sat down. ``My
grandfather has come round after all.''
``What, about Adam?''
``Yes; I should have ridden over to tell you about it, only I was
so busy. You know I told you I had quite given up arguing the
matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)--I thought it was hopeless--but yesterday
morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) asked me to come in here to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) before I went out,
and astonished me by saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had decided on all the new
arrangements he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) should make in consequence of old Satchell
being obliged to lay by work, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) intended to employ
Adam in superintending the woods at a salary of a guinea a-week,
and the use of a pony to be kept here. I believe the secret of it is,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) saw from the first it would be a profitable plan, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had
some particular dislike of Adam to get over--and besides, the fact
that I propose a thing is generally a reason with him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) for rejecting
it. There's the most curious contradiction in my grandfather: I
know he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) means to leave me all the money he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) has saved, and he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) is
likely enough to have cut off poor Aunt Lydia, who has been a
slave to him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) all her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) life, with only five hundred a-year, for the sake
of giving me all the more; and yet I sometimes think he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) positively
hates me because I'm his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) heir. I believe if I were to break my neck,
he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) would feel it the greatest misfortune that could befall him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>), and
yet it seems a pleasure to him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) to make my life a series of petty
annoyances.''
``Ah, my boy, it is not only woman's love that is απερϖτοζ ερϖζ



<p/>338

<p/>as old Æschylus calls it. There's plenty of `unloving love' in the
world of a masculine kind. But tell me about Adam. Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
accepted the post? I don't see that it can be much more profitable
than his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) present work, though, to be sure, it will leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) a good
deal of time on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) own hands.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I felt some doubt about it when I spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
seemed to hesitate at first. His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) objection was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
should not be able to satisfy my grandfather. But I begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) as
a personal favour to me not to let any reason prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) from
accepting the place, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) really liked the employment and would
not be giving up anything that was more profitable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
assured me he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) should like it of all things--it would be a great step
forward for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) in business, and it would enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to do what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had long wished to do, to give up working for Burge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>)
shall have plenty of time to superintend a little business of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>)
own, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) and Seth will carry on, and will perhaps be able to
enlarge by degrees. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) has agreed at last, and I have arranged
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) shall dine with the large tenants to-day; and I mean to
announce the appointment to them, and ask them to drink Adam's
health. It's a little drama I've got up in honour of my friend Adam.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'s a fine fellow, and I like the opportunity of letting people know
that I think so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A drama in which friend Arthur piques himself on having a
pretty part to play,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Irwine, smiling. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) saw
Arthur colour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) went on relentingly, ``My part, you know, is
always that of the old fogy who sees nothing to admire in the
young folks. I don't like to admit that I'm proud of my pupil when
he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) does graceful things. But I must play the amiable old
gentleman for once, and second your toast in honour of Adam. Has



<p/>339

<p/>your grandfather yielded on the other point too, and agreed to
have a respectable man as steward?''
``Oh no,'' said Arthur, rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) chair with an air of
impatience and walking along the room with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
pockets. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>)'s got some project or other about letting the Chase
Farm and bargaining for a supply of milk and butter for the house.
But I ask no questions about it--it makes me too angry. I believe
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) means to do all the business himself, and have nothing in the
shape of a steward. It's amazing what energy he (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>) has, though.''
``Well, we'll go to the ladies now,'' said Mr. Irwine, rising too. ``I
want to tell my mother what a splendid throne you've prepared for
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) under the marquee.''
``Yes, and we must be going to luncheon too,'' said Arthur. <div class="bookquote">``It
must be two o’clock, for there is the gong beginning to sound for
the tenants' dinners.''

<p/>Chapter XXIII
Dinner-Time

<p/>W

<p/>hen Adam heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was to dine upstairs with the
large tenants, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) felt rather uncomfortable at the idea of
being exalted in this way above his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother and Seth,
who were to dine in the cloisters below. But Mr. Mills, the butler,
assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Mills</b></font>) that Captain Donnithorne had given particular orders
about it, and would be very angry if Adam was not there.
Adam nodded and went up to Seth, who was standing a few
yards off. <div class="bookquote">``Seth, lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``the captain has sent to say I'm to
dine upstairs--he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) wishes it particular, Mr. Mills says, so I suppose
it 'ud be behaving ill for me not to go. But I don't like sitting up
above thee and mother, as if I was better than my own flesh and
blood. Thee 't not take it unkind, I hope?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay, lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Seth, <div class="bookquote">``thy honour's our honour; and if
thee get'st respect, thee 'st won it by thy own deserts. The further
I see thee above me, the better, so long as thee feel'st like a
brother to me. It's because o' thy being appointed over the woods,
and it's nothing but what's right. That's a place o' trust, and thee 't
above a common workman now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, ``but nobody knows a word about it yet. I
haven't given notice to Mr. Burge about leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>), and I don't
like to tell anybody else about it before he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) knows, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>)'ll be a
good bit hurt, I doubt. People 'ull be wondering to see me there,
and they'll like enough be guessing the reason and asking
questions, for there's been so much talk up and down about my




<p/>341

<p/>having the place, this last three weeks.''
``Well, thee canst say thee wast ordered to come without being
told the reason. That's the truth. And mother 'ull be fine and joyful
about it. Let's go and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''
Adam was not the only guest invited to come upstairs on other
grounds than the amount he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) contributed to the rent-roll. There
were other people in the two parishes who derived dignity from
their functions rather than from their pocket, and of these Bartle
Massey was one. His (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) lame walk was rather slower than usual on
this warm day, so Adam lingered behind when the bell rang for
dinner, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) might walk up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) old friend; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was a
little too shy to join the Poyser party on this public occasion.
Opportunities of getting to Hetty's side would be sure to turn up in
the course of the day, and Adam contented himself with that for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
disliked any risk of being ``joked'' about Hetty--the big,
outspoken, fearless man was very shy and diffident as to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lovemaking.
``Well, Mester Massey,'' said Adam, as Bartle came up ``I'm
going to dine upstairs with you to-day: the captain's sent me
orders.''
``Ah!'' said Bartle, pausing, with one hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) back. ``Then
there's something in the wind--there's something in the wind.
Have you heard anything about what the old squire means to do?''
``Why, yes,'' said Adam; ``I'll tell you what I know, because I
believe you can keep a still tongue in your head if you like, and I
hope you'll not let drop a word till it's common talk, for I've
particular reasons against its being known.''
``Trust to me, my boy, trust to me. I've got no wife to worm it
out of me and then run out and cackle it in everybody's hearing. If



<p/>342

<p/>you trust a man, let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be a bachelor--let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be a bachelor.''
``Well, then, it was so far settled yesterday that I'm to take the
management o' the woods. The captain sent for me t' offer it me,
when I was seeing to the poles and things here and I've agreed to
't. But if anybody asks any questions upstairs, just you take no
notice, and turn the talk to something else, and I'll be obliged to
you. Now, let us go on, for we're pretty nigh the last, I think.''
``I know what to do, never fear,'' said Bartle, moving on. ``The
news will be good sauce to my dinner. Aye, aye, my boy, you'll get
on. I'll back you for an eye at measuring and a head-piece for
figures, against any man in this county and you've had good
teaching--you've had good teaching.''
When they got upstairs, the question which Arthur had left
unsettled, as to who was to be president, and who vice, was still
under discussion, so that Adam's entrance passed without remark.
``It stands to sense,'' Mr. Casson was saying, ``as old Mr. Poyser,
as is th' oldest man i' the room, should sit at top o' the table. I
wasn't butler fifteen year without learning the rights and the
wrongs about dinner.''
``Nay, nay,'' said old Martin, ``I’n gi’en up to my son; I'm no
tenant now: let my son take my place. Th' ould foulks ha' had their
turn: they mun make way for the young uns.''
``I should ha' thought the biggest tenant had the best right,
more nor th' oldest,'' said Luke Britton, who was not fond of the
critical Mr. Poyser; ``there's Mester Holdsworth has more land nor
anybody else on th' estate.''
``Well,'' said Mr. Poyser, <div class="bookquote">``suppose we say the man wi' the
foulest land shall sit at top; then whoever gets th' honour, there'll
be no envying on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>343

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, here's Mester Massey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Craig/Craig</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Craig, who, being a
neutral in the dispute, had no interest but in conciliation; <div class="bookquote">``the
schoolmaster ought to be able to tell you what's right. Who's to sit
at top o' the table, Mr. Massey?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Craig/Craig</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, the broadest man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div>said Bartle; <div class="bookquote">``and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't take
up other folks' room; and the next broadest must sit at bottom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div>This happy mode of settling the dispute produced much
laughter--a smaller joke would have sufficed for that Mr. Casson,
however, did not feel it compatible with his (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) dignity and superior
knowledge to join in the laugh, until it turned out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) was fixed
on as the second broadest man. Martin Poyser the younger, as the
broadest, was to be president, and Mr. Casson, as next broadest,
was to be vice.
Owing to this arrangement, Adam, being, of course, at the
bottom of the table, fell under the immediate observation of Mr.
Casson, who, too much occupied with the question of precedence,
had not hitherto noticed his (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) entrance. Mr. Casson, we have seen,
considered Adam <div class="bookquote">``rather lifted up and peppery-like'' (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>: he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought
the gentry made more fuss about this young carpenter than was
necessary; they made no fuss about Mr. Casson, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) had
been an excellent butler for fifteen years.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, Mr. Bede, you're one o' them as mounts hup'ards apace,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) said, when Adam sat down. <div class="bookquote">``You've niver dined here before, as
I remember.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Mr. Casson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) strong voice, that could be
heard along the table; <div class="bookquote">``I've never dined here before, but I come by
Captain Donnithorne's wish, and I hope it's not disagreeable to
anybody here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said several voices at once, ``we're glad ye're come.



<p/>344

<p/>Who's got anything to say again' it?''
``And ye'll sing us `Over the hills and far away,' after dinner,
wonna ye?'' said Mr. Chowne. ``That's a song I'm uncommon fond
on.''
``Peeh!'' said Mr. Craig; ``it's not to be named by side o' the
Scotch tunes. I've never cared about singing myself; I've had
something better to do. A man that's got the names and the natur
o' plants in's head isna likely to keep a hollow place t' hold tunes
in. But a second cousin o' mine, a drovier, was a rare hand at
remembering the Scotch tunes. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)'d got nothing else to think on.''
``The Scotch tunes!'' said Bartle Massey, contemptuously; ``I've
heard enough o' the Scotch tunes to last me while I live. They're fit
for nothing but to frighten the birds with--that's to say, the
English birds, for the Scotch birds may sing Scotch for what I
know. Give the lads a bagpipe instead of a rattle, and I'll answer
for it the corn 'll be safe.''
``Yes, there's folks as find a pleasure in undervallying what they
know but little about,'' said Mr. Craig.
``Why, the Scotch tunes are just like a scolding, nagging
woman,'' Bartle went on, without deigning to notice Mr. Craig's
remark. <div class="bookquote">``They go on with the same thing over and over again, and
never come to a reasonable end. Anybody 'ud think the Scotch
tunes had always been asking a question of somebody as deaf as
old Taft, and had never got an answer yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Adam minded the less about sitting by Mr. Casson, because this
position enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to see Hetty, who was not far off him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) at the
next table. Hetty, however, had not even noticed his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) presence yet,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was giving angry attention to Totty, who insisted on
drawing up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) feet on to the bench in antique fashion, and



<p/>345

<p/>thereby threatened to make dusty marks on Hetty's pink-andwhite frock. No sooner were the little fat legs pushed down than
up they came again, for Totty's eyes were too busy in staring at the
large dishes to see where the plum pudding was for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to retain
any consciousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) legs. Hetty got quite out of patience, and
at last, with a frown and pout, and gathering tears, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh
dear, Aunt, I wish you'd speak to Totty; she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) keeps putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) legs
up so, and messing my frock.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter wi' the child? She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) can niver please you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother. <div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) come by the side o' me, then. I can put
up wi' her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam was looking at Hetty, and saw the frown, and pout, and
the dark eyes seeming to grow larger with pettish half-gathered
tears. Quiet Mary Burge, who sat near enough to see that Hetty
was cross and that Adam's eyes were fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), thought that so
sensible a man as Adam must be reflecting on the small value of
beauty in a woman whose temper was bad. Mary was a good girl,
not given to indulge in evil feelings, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said to herself, that,
since Hetty had a bad temper, it was better Adam should know it.
And it was quite true that if Hetty had been plain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would have
looked very ugly and unamiable at that moment, and no one's
moral judgment upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would have been in the least beguiled.
But really there was something quite charming in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) pettishness:
it looked so much more like innocent distress than ill humour; and
the severe Adam felt no movement of disapprobation; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) only felt
a sort of amused pity, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had seen a kitten setting up its back,
or a little bird with its feathers ruffled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could not gather what
was vexing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), but it was impossible to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to feel otherwise than
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was the prettiest thing in the world, and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could



<p/>346

<p/>have his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) way, nothing should ever vex her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) any more. And
presently, when Totty was gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) eye, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) face
broke into one of its brightest smiles, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) nodded to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). It was
a bit of flirtation--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knew Mary Burge was looking at them. But
the smile was like wine to Adam.




<p/>347

<p/>Chapter XXIV
The Health-Drinking

<p/>W

<p/>hen the dinner was over, and the first draughts from
the great cask of birthday ale were brought up, room
was made for the broad Mr. Poyser at the side of the
table, and two chairs were placed at the head. It had been settled
very definitely what Mr. Poyser was to do when the young squire
should appear, and for the last five minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) had been in a state
of abstraction, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) eyes fixed on the dark picture opposite,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) hands busy with the loose cash and other articles in his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
breeches pockets.
When the young squire entered, with Mr. Irwine by his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) side,
every one stood up, and this moment of homage was very
agreeable to Arthur. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) liked to feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own importance, and
besides that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) cared a great deal for the good-will of these
people: he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was fond of thinking that they had a hearty, special
regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). The pleasure he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) felt was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``My
grandfather and I hope all our friends here have enjoyed their
dinner, and find my birthday ale good. Mr. Irwine and I are come
to taste it with you, and I am sure we shall all like anything the
better that the rector shares with us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>All eyes were now turned on Mr. Poyser, who, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) hands
still busy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) pockets, began with the deliberateness of a slowstriking clock. <div class="bookquote">``Captain, my neighbours have put it upo' me to
speak for ’em to-day, for where folks think pretty much alike, one
spokesman's as good as a score. And though we've mayhappen got




<p/>348

<p/>contrairy ways o' thinking about a many things--one man lays
down his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) land one way an' another another--an' I'll not take it
upon me to speak to no man's farming, but my own--this I'll say,
as we're all o' one mind about our young squire. We've pretty nigh
all on us known you when you war a little un, an' we've niver
known anything on you but what was good an' honourable. You
speak fair an' y' act fair, an' we're joyful when we look forrard to
your being our landlord, for we b'lieve you mean to do right by
everybody, an' 'ull make no man's bread bitter to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if you can
help it. That's what I mean, an' that's what we all mean; and when
a man's said what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) means, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d better stop, for th' ale 'ull be
none the better for stannin'. An' I'll not say how we like th' ale yet,
for we couldna well taste it till we'd drunk your health in it; but
the dinner was good, an' if there's anybody hasna enjoyed it, it
must be the fault of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own inside. An' as for the rector's
company, it's well known as that's welcome t' all the parish
wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may be; an' I hope, an' we all hope, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll live to see
us old folks, an' our children grown to men an' women an' Your
Honour a family man. I've no more to say as concerns the present
time, an' so we'll drink our young squire's health--three times
three.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hereupon a glorious shouting, a rapping, a jingling, a clattering,
and a shouting, with plentiful da capo, pleasanter than a strain of
sublimest music in the ears that receive such a tribute for the first
time. Arthur had felt a twinge of conscience during Mr. Poyser's
speech, but it was too feeble to nullify the pleasure he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) felt in being
praised. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) not deserve what was said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) on the whole? If
there was something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) conduct that Poyser wouldn't have
liked if he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) had known it, why, no man's conduct will bear too close



<p/>349

<p/>an inspection; and Poyser was not likely to know it; and, after all,
what had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) done? Gone a little too far, perhaps, in flirtation, but
another man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) place would have acted much worse; and no
harm would come--no harm should come, for the next time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
alone with Hetty, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) must not think
seriously of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) or of what had passed. It was necessary to Arthur,
you perceive, to be satisfied with himself. Uncomfortable thoughts
must be got rid of by good intentions for the future, which can be
formed so rapidly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had time to be uncomfortable and to
become easy again before Mr. Poyser's slow speech was finished,
and when it was time for him (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) to speak he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was quite light-hearted.
<div class="bookquote">``I thank you all, my good friends and neighbours,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>Arthur said,
``for the good opinion of me, and the kind feelings towards me
which Mr. Poyser has been expressing on your behalf and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
own, and it will always be my heartiest wish to deserve them. In
the course of things we may expect that, if I live, I shall one day or
other be your landlord; indeed, it is on the ground of that
expectation that my grandfather has wished me to celebrate this
day and to come among you now; and I look forward to this
position, not merely as one of power and pleasure for myself, but
as a means of benefiting my neighbours. It hardly becomes so
young a man as I am to talk much about farming to you, who are
most of you so much older, and are men of experience; still, I have
interested myself a good deal in such matters, and learned as
much about them as my opportunities have allowed; and when the
course of events shall place the estate in my hands, it will be my
first desire to afford my tenants all the encouragement a landlord
can give them, in improving their land and trying to bring about a
better practice of husbandry. It will be my wish to be looked on by



<p/>350

<p/>all my deserving tenants as their best friend, and nothing would
make me so happy as to be able to respect every man on the
estate, and to be respected by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in return. It is not my place at
present to enter into particulars; I only meet your good hopes
concerning me by telling you that my own hopes correspond to
them--that what you expect from me I desire to fulfil; and I am
quite of Mr. Poyser's opinion, that when a man has said what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
means, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had better stop. But the pleasure I feel in having my
own health drunk by you would not be perfect if we did not drink
the health of my grandfather, who has filled the place of both
parents to me. I will say no more, until you have joined me in
drinking his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) health on a day when he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) has wished me to appear
among you as the future representative of his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) name and family.''
Perhaps there was no one present except Mr. Irwine who
thoroughly understood and approved Arthur's graceful mode of
proposing his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) grandfather's health. The farmers thought the
young squire knew well enough that they hated the old squire, and
Mrs. Poyser said, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)'d better not ha' stirred a kettle o' sour
broth.'' The bucolic mind does not readily apprehend the
refinements of good taste. But the toast could not be rejected and
when it had been drunk, Arthur said, <div class="bookquote">``I thank you, both for my
grandfather and myself; and now there is one more thing I wish to
tell you, that you may share my pleasure about it, as I hope and
believe you will. I think there can be no man here who has not a
respect, and some of you, I am sure, have a very high regard, for
my friend Adam Bede. It is well known to every one in this
neighbourhood that there is no man whose word can be more
depended on than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); that whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) undertakes to do, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does
well, and is as careful for the interests of those who employ him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as



<p/>351

<p/>for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own. I'm proud to say that I was very fond of Adam when I
was a little boy, and I have never lost my old feeling for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)--I
think that shows that I know a good fellow when I find him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). It has
long been my wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) should have the management of the
woods on the estate, which happen to be very valuable, not only
because I think so highly of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) character, but because he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has the
knowledge and the skill which fit him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) for the place. And I am
happy to tell you that it is my grandfather's wish too, and it is now
settled that Adam shall manage the woods--a change which I am
sure will be very much for the advantage of the estate; and I hope
you will by-and-by join me in drinking his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) health, and in wishing
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) all the prosperity in life that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) deserves. But there is a still
older friend of mine than Adam Bede present, and I need not tell
you that it is Mr. Irwine. I'm sure you will agree with me that we
must drink no other person's health until we have drunk his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>). I
know you have all reason to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>), but no one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
parishioners has so much reason as I. Come, charge your glasses,
and let us drink to our excellent rector--three times three!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This toast was drunk with all the enthusiasm that was wanting
to the last, and it certainly was the most picturesque moment in
the scene when Mr. Irwine got up to speak, and all the faces in the
room were turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>). The superior refinement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
face was much more striking than that of Arthur's when seen in
comparison with the people round them. Arthur's was a much
commoner British face, and the splendour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) new-fashioned
clothes was more akin to the young farmer's taste in costume than
Mr. Irwine's powder and the well-brushed but well-worn black,
which seemed to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) chosen suit for great occasions; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) had
the mysterious secret of never wearing a new-looking coat.



<p/>352

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is not the first time, by a great many,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) said, ``that I
have had to thank my parishioners for giving me tokens of their
goodwill, but neighbourly kindness is among those things that are
the more precious the older they get. Indeed, our pleasant meeting
to-day is a proof that when what is good comes of age and is likely
to live, there is reason for rejoicing, and the relation between us as
clergyman and parishioners came of age two years ago, for it is
three-and-twenty years since I first came among you, and I see
some tall fine-looking young men here, as well as some blooming
young women, that were far from looking as pleasantly at me
when I christened them as I am happy to see them looking now.
But I'm sure you will not wonder when I say that among all those
young men, the one in whom I have the strongest interest is my
friend Mr. Arthur Donnithorne, for whom you have just expressed
your regard. I had the pleasure of being his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) tutor for several years,
and have naturally had opportunities of knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) intimately
which cannot have occurred to any one else who is present; and I
have some pride as well as pleasure in assuring you that I share
your high hopes concerning him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>), and your confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>)
possession of those qualities which will make him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) an excellent
landlord when the time shall come for him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) to take that important
position among you. We feel alike on most matters on which a man
who is getting towards fifty can feel in common with a young man
of one-and-twenty, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has just been expressing a feeling
which I share very heartily, and I would not willingly omit the
opportunity of saying so. That feeling is his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) value and respect for
Adam Bede. People in a high station are of course more thought of
and talked about and have their virtues more praised, than those
whose lives are passed in humble everyday work; but every



<p/>353

<p/>sensible man knows how necessary that humble everyday work is,
and how important it is to us that it should be done well. And I
agree with my friend Mr. Arthur Donnithorne in feeling that when
a man whose duty lies in that sort of work shows a character
which would make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an example in any station, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) merit
should be acknowledged. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is one of those to whom honour is
due, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends should delight to honour him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I know Adam
Bede well--I know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) is as a workman, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) has
been as a son and brother--and I am saying the simplest truth
when I say that I respect him (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) as much as I respect any man living.
But I am not speaking to you about a stranger; some of you are his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
intimate friends, and I believe there is not one here who does not
know enough of him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) to join heartily in drinking his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) health.''
As Mr. Irwine paused, Arthur jumped up and, filling his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) glass,
said, ``A bumper to Adam Bede, and may he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) live to have sons as
faithful and clever as himself!''
No hearer, not even Bartle Massey, was so delighted with this
toast as Mr. Poyser. <div class="bookquote">``Tough work''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>as his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) first speech had been, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
would have started up to make another if he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) had not known the
extreme irregularity of such a course. As it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) found an outlet
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) feeling in drinking his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) ale unusually fast, and setting down
his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) glass with a swing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) arm and a determined rap. If
Jonathan Burge and a few others felt less comfortable on the
occasion, they tried their best to look contented, and so the toast
was drunk with a goodwill apparently unanimous.
Adam was rather paler than usual when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) got up to thank his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
friends. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was a good deal moved by this public tribute--very
naturally, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was in the presence of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) little world, and it
was uniting to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) honour. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) felt no shyness about



<p/>354

<p/>speaking, not being troubled with small vanity or lack of words; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
looked neither awkward nor embarrassed, but stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) usual
firm upright attitude, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) head thrown a little backward and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hands perfectly still, in that rough dignity which is peculiar to
intelligent, honest, well-built workmen, who are never wondering
what is their business in the world.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm quite taken by surprise,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said. ``I didn't expect anything
o' this sort, for it's a good deal more than my wages. But I've the
more reason to be grateful to you, Captain, and to you, Mr. Irwine,
and to all my friends here, who've drunk my health and wished me
well. It 'ud be nonsense for me to be saying, I don't at all deserve
th' opinion you have of me; that 'ud be poor thanks to you, to say
that you've known me all these years and yet haven't sense
enough to find out a great deal o' the truth about me. You think, if
I undertake to do a bit o' work, I'll do it well, be my pay big or
little--and that's true. I'd be ashamed to stand before you here if it
wasna true. But it seems to me that's a man's plain duty, and
nothing to be conceited about, and it's pretty clear to me as I've
never done more than my duty; for let us do what we will, it's only
making use o' the sperrit and the powers that ha' been given to us.
And so this kindness o' yours, I'm sure, is no debt you owe me, but
a free gift, and as such I accept it and am thankful. And as to this
new employment I've taken in hand, I'll only say that I took it at
Captain Donnithorne's desire, and that I'll try to fulfil his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
expectations. I'd wish for no better lot than to work under him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>),
and to know that while I was getting my own bread I was taking
care of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) int'rests. For I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)'s one o those gentlemen as
wishes to do the right thing, and to leave the world a bit better
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) found it, which it's my belief every man may do, whether



<p/>355

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s gentle or simple, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sets a good bit o' work going and
finds the money, or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does the work with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own hands.
There's no occasion for me to say any more about what I feel
towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): I hope to show it through the rest o' my life in my
actions.''
There were various opinions about Adam's speech: some of the
women whispered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) didn't show himself thankful enough,
and seemed to speak as proud as could be; but most of the men
were of opinion that nobody could speak more straightfor'ard, and
that Adam was as fine a chap as need to be. While such
observations were being buzzed about, mingled with wonderings
as to what the old squire meant to do for a bailiff, and whether he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>)
was going to have a steward, the two gentlemen had risen, and
were walking round to the table where the wives and children sat.
There was none of the strong ale here, of course, but wine and
dessert--sparkling gooseberry for the young ones, and some good
sherry for the mothers. Mrs. Poyser was at the head of this table,
and Totty was now seated in her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) lap, bending her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) small nose deep
down into a wine-glass in search of the nuts floating there.
``How do you do, Mrs. Poyser?'' said Arthur. ``Weren't you
pleased to hear your husband make such a good speech to-day?''
``Oh, sir, the men are mostly so tongue-tied--you're forced
partly to guess what they mean, as you do wi' the dumb creaturs.''
``What! you think you could have made it better for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)?'' said
Mr. Irwine, laughing.
``Well, sir, when I want to say anything, I can mostly find words
to say it in, thank God. Not as I'm a-finding faut wi' my husband,
for if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s a man o' few words, what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'ll stand to.''
<div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I never saw a prettier party than this,''  (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div>Arthur said,



<p/>356

<p/>looking round at the apple-cheeked children. <div class="bookquote">``My aunt and the
Miss Irwines will come up and see you presently. They were afraid
of the noise of the toasts, but it would be a shame for them not to
see you at table.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) walked on, speaking to the mothers and patting the
children, while Mr. Irwine satisfied himself with standing still and
nodding at a distance, that no one's attention might be disturbed
from the young squire, the hero of the day. Arthur did not venture
to stop near Hetty, but merely bowed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) passed along the
opposite side. The foolish child felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heart swelling with
discontent; for what woman was ever satisfied with apparent
neglect, even when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knows it to be the mask of love? Hetty
thought this was going to be the most miserable day she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had had
for a long while, a moment of chill daylight and reality came across
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) dream: Arthur, who had seemed so near to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) only a few
hours before, was separated from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), as the hero of a great
procession is separated from a small outsider in the crowd.




<p/>357

<p/>Chapter XXV
The Games

<p/>T

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) great dance was not to begin until eight o’clock, but for
any lads and lasses who liked to dance on the shady grass
before then, there was music always at hand--for was not
the band of the Benefit Club capable of playing excellent jigs,
reels, and hornpipes? And, besides this, there was a grand band
hired from Rosseter, who, with their wonderful wind-instruments
and puffed-out cheeks, were themselves a delightful show to the
small boys and girls. To say nothing of Joshua Rann's fiddle,
which, by an act of generous forethought, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) had provided himself
with, in case any one should be of sufficiently pure taste to prefer
dancing to a solo on that instrument.
Meantime, when the sun had moved off the great open space in
front of the house, the games began. There were, of course, wellsoaped poles to be climbed by the boys and youths, races to be run
by the old women, races to be run in sacks, heavy weights to be
lifted by the strong men, and a long list of challenges to such
ambitious attempts as that of walking as many yards possible on
one leg--feats in which it was generally remarked that Wiry Ben,
being <div class="bookquote">``the lissom'st, springest fellow i' the country,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wiry Ben</b></font>)</div>was sure to
be pre-eminent. To crown all, there was to be a donkey-race--that
sublimest of all races, conducted on the grand socialistic idea of
everybody encouraging everybody else's donkey, and the sorriest
donkey winning.
And soon after four o’clock, splendid old Mrs. Irwine, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)




<p/>358

<p/>damask satin and jewels and black lace, was led out by Arthur,
followed by the whole family party, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) raised seat under the
striped marquee, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) was to give out the prizes to the
victors. Staid, formal Miss Lydia had requested to resign that
queenly office to the royal old lady, and Arthur was pleased with
this opportunity of gratifying his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) godmother's taste for stateliness.
Old Mr. Donnithorne, the delicately clean, finely scented, withered
old man, led out Miss Irwine, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) air of punctilious, acid
politeness; Mr. Gawaine brought Miss Lydia, looking neutral and
stiff in an elegant peach-blossom silk; and Mr. Irwine came last
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) pale sister Anne. No other friend of the family, besides
Mr. Gawaine, was invited to-day; there was to be a grand dinner
for the neighbouring gentry on the morrow, but to-day all the
forces were required for the entertainment of the tenants.
There was a sunk fence in front of the marquee, dividing the
lawn from the park, but a temporary bridge had been made for the
passage of the victors, and the groups of people standing, or seated
here and there on benches, stretched on each side of the open
space from the white marquees up to the sunk fence.
<div class="bookquote">``Upon my word it's a pretty sight,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
deep voice, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was seated, and looked round on the bright
scene with its dark-green background; <div class="bookquote">``and it's the last fete-day
I'm likely to see, unless you make haste and get married, Arthur.
But take care you get a charming bride, else I would rather die
without seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're so terribly fastidious, godmother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>said Arthur, <div class="bookquote">``I'm
afraid I should never satisfy you with my choice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>``Well, I won't forgive you if she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>)'s not handsome. I can't be put
off with amiability, which is always the excuse people are making



<p/>359

<p/>for the existence of plain people. And she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) must not be silly; that
will never do, because you'll want managing, and a silly woman
can't manage you. Who is that tall young man, Dauphin, with the
mild face? There, standing without his (<font color='blue'><b>Dauphin</b></font>) hat, and taking such care of
that tall old woman by the side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dauphin</b></font>)--his (<font color='blue'><b>Dauphin</b></font>) mother, of course. I
like to see that.''
``What, don't you know him (<font color='blue'><b>Dauphin</b></font>), Mother?'' said Mr. Irwine. ``That is
Seth Bede, Adam's brother--a Methodist, but a very good fellow.
Poor Seth has looked rather down-hearted of late; I thought it was
because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) father's dying in that sad way, but Joshua Rann
tells me he (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) wanted to marry that sweet little Methodist preacher
who was here about a month ago, and I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>).''
``Ah, I remember hearing about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>). But there are no end of
people here that I don't know, for they're grown up and altered so
since I used to go about.''
``What excellent sight you have!'' said old Mr. Donnithorne, who
was holding a double glass up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) eyes, ``to see the expression of
that young man's face so far off. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face is nothing but a pale
blurred spot to me. But I fancy I have the advantage of you when
we come to look close. I can read small print without spectacles.''
``Ah, my dear sir, you began with being very near-sighted, and
those near-sighted eyes always wear the best. I want very strong
spectacles to read with, but then I think my eyes get better and
better for things at a distance. I suppose if I could live another fifty
years, I should be blind to everything that wasn't out of other
people's sight, like a man who stands in a well and sees nothing
but the stars.''
``See,'' said Arthur, <div class="bookquote">``the old women are ready to set out on their
race now. Which do you bet on, Gawaine?''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>360

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The long-legged one, unless they're going to have several
heats, and then the little wiry one may win.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There are the Poysers, Mother, not far off on the right hand,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Irwine. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Poyser is looking at you. Do take notice of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``To be sure I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, giving a gracious bow to
Mrs. Poyser. <div class="bookquote">``A woman who sends me such excellent creamcheese is not to be neglected. Bless me! What a fat child that is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
is holding on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knee! But who is that pretty girl with dark eyes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is Hetty Sorrel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lydia/Lydia/Miss Lydia Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>said Miss Lydia Donnithorne, <div class="bookquote">``Martin
Poyser's niece--a very likely young person, and well-looking too.
My maid has taught her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) fine needlework, and she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) has mended
some lace of mine very respectably indeed--very respectably.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lydia/Lydia/Miss Lydia Donnithorne</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) has lived with the Poysers six or seven years,
Mother; you must have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Irwine.
<div class="bookquote">``No, I've never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), child--at least not as she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) is now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Irwine</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Irwine, continuing to look at Hetty. <div class="bookquote">``Well-looking, indeed!
She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)'s a perfect beauty! I've never seen anything so pretty since my
young days. What a pity such beauty as that should be thrown
away among the farmers, when it's wanted so terribly among the
good families without fortune! I daresay, now, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)'ll marry a man
who would have thought her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) just as pretty if she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had had round
eyes and red hair.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>Arthur dared not turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) eyes towards Hetty while Mrs. Irwine
was speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) feigned not to hear, and to be occupied
with something on the opposite side. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) plainly
enough without looking; saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) in heightened beauty, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) beauty praised--for other men's opinion, you know, was
like a native climate to Arthur's feelings: it was the air on which



<p/>361

<p/>they thrived the best, and grew strong. Yes! she (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) was enough to
turn any man's head: any man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) place would have done and
felt the same. And to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) up after all, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was determined to
do, would be an act that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should always look back upon with
pride.
<div class="bookquote">``No, Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div>and Mr. Irwine, replying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) last words; <div class="bookquote">``I
can't agree with you there. The common people are not quite so
stupid as you imagine. The commonest man, who has his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ounce of
sense and feeling, is conscious of the difference between a lovely,
delicate woman and a coarse one. Even a dog feels a difference in
their presence. The man may be no better able than the dog to
explain the influence the more refined beauty has on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
feels it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bless me, Dauphin, what does an old bachelor like you know
about it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that is one of the matters in which old bachelors are wiser
than married men, because they have time for more general
contemplation. Your fine critic of woman must never shackle his (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>)
judgment by calling one woman his (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) own. But, as an example of
what I was saying, that pretty Methodist preacher I mentioned just
now told me that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had preached to the roughest miners and
had never been treated with anything but the utmost respect and
kindness by them. The reason is--though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) doesn't know it--
that there's so much tenderness, refinement, and purity about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
Such a woman as that brings with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) `airs from heaven' that the
coarsest fellow is not insensible to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Here's a delicate bit of womanhood, or girlhood, coming to
receive a prize, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gawaine/Mr. Gawaine</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gawaine. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must be one of
the racers in the sacks, who had set off before we came.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>362

<p/>The <div class="bookquote">``bit of womanhood''  (<font color='red'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)</div>was our old acquaintance Bessy
Cranage, otherwise Chad's Bess, whose large red cheeks and
blowsy person had undergone an exaggeration of colour, which, if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) had happened to be a heavenly body, would have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
sublime. Bessy, I am sorry to say, had taken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) ear-rings again
since Dinah's departure, and was otherwise decked out in such
small finery as she (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) could muster. Any one who could have looked
into poor Bessy's heart would have seen a striking resemblance
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) little hopes and anxieties and Hetty's. The advantage,
perhaps, would have been on Bessy's side in the matter of feeling.
But then, you see, they were so very different outside! You would
have been inclined to box Bessy's ears, and you would have longed
to kiss Hetty.
Bessy had been tempted to run the arduous race, partly from
mere hedonish gaiety, partly because of the prize. Some one had
said there were to be cloaks and other nice clothes for prizes, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) approached the marquee, fanning herself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
handkerchief, but with exultation sparkling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) round eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``Here is the prize for the first sack-race,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lydia/Lydia/Miss Lydia Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>said Miss Lydia,
taking a large parcel from the table where the prizes were laid and
giving it to Mrs. Irwine before Bessy came up, <div class="bookquote">``an excellent
grogram gown and a piece of flannel.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bessy/Bessy Cranage</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You didn't think the winner was to be so young, I suppose,
Aunt?''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>said Arthur. <div class="bookquote">``Couldn't you find something else for this girl,
and save that grim-looking gown for one of the older women?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have bought nothing but what is useful and substantial,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lydia/Lydia/Miss Lydia Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>said
Miss Lydia, adjusting her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) own lace; <div class="bookquote">``I should not think of
encouraging a love of finery in young women of that class. I have a
scarlet cloak, but that is for the old woman who wins.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lydia/Lydia/Miss Lydia Donnithorne</b></font>)</div><p/>363

<p/>This speech of Miss Lydia's produced rather a mocking
expression in Mrs. Irwine's face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) looked at Arthur, while
Bessy came up and dropped a series of curtsies.
<div class="bookquote">``This is Bessy Cranage, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Irwine, kindly,
<div class="bookquote">``Chad Cranage's daughter. You remember Chad Cranage, the
blacksmith?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Irwine</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Irwine. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Bessy, here is your
prize--excellent warm things for winter. I'm sure you have had
hard work to win them this warm day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bessy/Bessy Cranage</b></font>)</div>Bessy's lip fell as she (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) saw the ugly, heavy gown--which felt so
hot and disagreeable too, on this July day, and was such a great
ugly thing to carry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) curtsies again, without
looking up, and with a growing tremulousness about the corners
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) mouth, and then turned away.
<div class="bookquote">``Poor girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>said Arthur; <div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s disappointed. I wish it
had been something more to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) taste.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s a bold-looking young person,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lydia/Lydia/Miss Lydia Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>observed Miss Lydia.
<div class="bookquote">``Not at all one I should like to encourage.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>Arthur silently resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would make Bessy a present of
money before the day was over, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) might buy something
more to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) mind; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), not aware of the consolation in store
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), turned out of the open space, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was visible from
the marquee, and throwing down the odious bundle under a tree,
began to cry--very much tittered at the while by the small boys. In
this situation she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was descried by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) discreet matronly cousin,
who lost no time in coming up, having just given the baby into her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
husband's charge.
<div class="bookquote">``What's the matter wi' ye?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bess</b></font>)</div>said Bess the matron, taking up the
bundle and examining it. ``Ye’n sweltered yoursen, I reckon,



<p/>364

<p/>running that fool's race. An' here, they’n gi’en you lots o' good
grogram and flannel, as should ha' been gi’en by good rights to
them as had the sense to keep away from such foolery. Ye might
spare me a bit o' this grogram to make clothes for the lad--ye war
ne’er ill-natured, Bess; I ne’er said that on ye.''
``Ye may take it all, for what I care,'' said Bess the maiden, with
a pettish movement, beginning to wipe away her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) tears and recover
herself.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I could do wi't, if so be ye want to get rid on 't,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the
disinterested cousin, walking quickly away with the bundle, lest
Chad's Bess should change her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) mind.
But that bonny-cheeked lass was blessed with an elasticity of
spirits that secured her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) from any rankling grief; and by the time
the grand climax of the donkey-race came on, her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) disappointment
was entirely lost in the delightful excitement of attempting to
stimulate the last donkey by hisses, while the boys applied the
argument of sticks. But the strength of the donkey mind lies in
adopting a course inversely as the arguments urged, which, well
considered, requires as great a mental force as the direct
sequence; and the present donkey proved the first-rate order of
his (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) intelligence by coming to a dead standstill just when the blows
were thickest. Great was the shouting of the crowd, radiant the
grinning of Bill Downes the stone-sawyer and the fortunate rider
of this superior beast, which stood calm and stiff-legged in the
midst of its triumph.
Arthur himself had provided the prizes for the men, and Bill
was made happy with a splendid pocket-knife, supplied with
blades and gimlets enough to make a man at home on a desert
island. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) had hardly returned from the marquee with the prize in



<p/>365

<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) hand, when it began to be understood that Wiry Ben proposed
to amuse the company, before the gentry went to dinner, with an
impromptu and gratuitous performance--namely, a hornpipe, the
main idea of which was doubtless borrowed; but this was to be
developed by the dancer in so peculiar and complex a manner that
no one could deny him (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) the praise of originality. Wiry Ben's pride
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) dancing--an accomplishment productive of great effect at
the yearly Wake--had needed only slightly elevating by an extra
quantity of good ale to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) that the gentry would be very
much struck with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) performance of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) hornpipe; and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) had
been decidedly encouraged in this idea by Joshua Rann, who
observed that it was nothing but right to do something to please
the young squire, in return for what he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) had done for them. You
will be the less surprised at this opinion in so grave a personage
when you learn that Ben had requested Mr. Rann to accompany
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) on the fiddle, and Joshua felt quite sure that though there
might not be much in the dancing, the music would make up for it.
Adam Bede, who was present in one of the large marquees, where
the plan was being discussed, told Ben he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) had better not make a
fool of himself--a remark which at once fixed Ben's
determination: he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) was not going to let anything alone because
Adam Bede turned up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) nose at it.
<div class="bookquote">``What's this, what's this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>said old Mr. Donnithorne. <div class="bookquote">``Is it
something you've arranged, Arthur? Here's the clerk coming with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) fiddle, and a smart fellow with a nosegay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) button-hole.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>said Arthur; <div class="bookquote">``I know nothing about it. By Jove, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)'s going
to dance! It's one of the carpenters--I forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) name at this
moment.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's Ben Cranage--Wiry Ben, they call him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Irwine;



<p/>366

<p/><div class="bookquote">``rather a loose fish, I think. Anne, my dear, I see that fiddlescraping is too much for you: you're getting tired. Let me take you
in now, that you may rest till dinner.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div>Miss Anne rose assentingly, and the good brother took her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
away, while Joshua's preliminary scrapings burst into the <div class="bookquote">``White
Cockade,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joshua/Joshua Rann/Mr. Rann</b></font>)</div>from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>) intended to pass to a variety of tunes, by
a series of transitions which his (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>) good ear really taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>) to
execute with some skill. It would have been an exasperating fact to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>) had known it, that the general attention was too
thoroughly absorbed by Ben's dancing for any one to give much
heed to the music.
Have you ever seen a real English rustic perform a solo dance?
Perhaps you have only seen a ballet rustic, smiling like a merry
countryman in crockery, with graceful turns of the haunch and
insinuating movements of the head. That is as much like the real
thing as the <div class="bookquote">``Bird Waltz''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>is like the song of birds. Wiry Ben never
smiled: he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) looked as serious as a dancing monkey--as serious as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) had been an experimental philosopher ascertaining in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) own
person the amount of shaking and the varieties of angularity that
could be given to the human limbs.
To make amends for the abundant laughter in the striped
marquee, Arthur clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hands continually and cried
<div class="bookquote">``Bravo!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>But Ben had one admirer whose eyes followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)
movements with a fervid gravity that equalled his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) own. It was
Martin Poyser, who was seated on a bench, with Tommy between
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) legs.
<div class="bookquote">``What dost think o' that?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) wife. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) goes as pat to
the music as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) was made o' clockwork. I used to be a pretty
good un at dancing myself when I was lighter, but I could niver ha'



<p/>367

<p/>hit it just to th' hair like that.''
``It's little matter what his (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) limbs are, to my thinking,'' re-turned
Mrs. Poyser. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>)'s empty enough i' the upper story, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>)'d niver
come jigging an' stamping i' that way, like a mad grasshopper, for
the gentry to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>). They're fit to die wi' laughing, I can see.''
``Well, well, so much the better, it amuses ’em,'' said Mr. Poyser,
who did not easily take an irritable view of things. <div class="bookquote">``But they're
going away now, t' have their dinner, I reckon. We'll move about a
bit, shall we, and see what Adam Bede's doing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>)'s got to look
after the drinking and things: I doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) hasna had much fun.''

<p/>Chapter XXVI
The Dance

<p/>A

<p/>rthur had chosen the entrance-hall for the ballroom: very
wisely, for no other room could have been so airy, or
would have had the advantage of the wide doors opening
into the garden, as well as a ready entrance into the other rooms.
To be sure, a stone floor was not the pleasantest to dance on, but
then, most of the dancers had known what it was to enjoy a
Christmas dance on kitchen quarries. It was one of those
entrance-halls which make the surrounding rooms look like
closets--with stucco angels, trumpets, and flower-wreaths on the
lofty ceiling, and great medallions of miscellaneous heroes on the
walls, alternating with statues in niches. Just the sort of place to
be ornamented well with green boughs, and Mr. Craig had been
proud to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) taste and his (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) hothouse plants on the occasion.
The broad steps of the stone staircase were covered with cushions
to serve as seats for the children, who were to stay till half-past
nine with the servant-maids to see the dancing, and as this dance
was confined to the chief tenants, there was abundant room for
every one. The lights were charmingly disposed in coloured-paper
lamps, high up among green boughs, and the farmers' wives and
daughters, as they peeped in, believed no scene could be more
splendid; they knew now quite well in what sort of rooms the king
and queen lived, and their thoughts glanced with some pity
towards cousins and acquaintances who had not this fine
opportunity of knowing how things went on in the great world.




<p/>369

<p/>The lamps were already lit, though the sun had not long set, and
there was that calm light out of doors in which we seem to see all
objects more distinctly than in the broad day.
It was a pretty scene outside the house: the farmers and their
families were moving about the lawn, among the flowers and
shrubs, or along the broad straight road leading from the east
front, where a carpet of mossy grass spread on each side, studded
here and there with a dark flat-boughed cedar, or a grand
pyramidal fir sweeping the ground with its branches, all tipped
with a fringe of paler green. The groups of cottagers in the park
were gradually diminishing, the young ones being attracted
towards the lights that were beginning to gleam from the windows
of the gallery in the abbey, which was to be their dancing-room,
and some of the sober elder ones thinking it time to go home
quietly. One of these was Lisbeth Bede, and Seth went with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>)--
not from filial attention only, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) conscience would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)
join in dancing. It had been rather a melancholy day to Seth:
Dinah had never been more constantly present with him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) than in
this scene, where everything was so unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) all the
more vividly after looking at the thoughtless faces and gaycoloured dresses of the young women--just as one feels the beauty
and the greatness of a pictured Madonna the more when it has
been for a moment screened from us by a vulgar head in a bonnet.
But this presence of Dinah in his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) mind only helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) to bear the
better with his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) mother's mood, which had been becoming more
and more querulous for the last hour. Poor Lisbeth was suffering
from a strange conflict of feelings. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) joy and pride in the honour
paid to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) darling son Adam was beginning to be worsted in the
conflict with the jealousy and fretfulness which had revived when



<p/>370

<p/>Adam came to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) that Captain Donnithorne desired him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) to
join the dancers in the hall. Adam was getting more and more out
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) reach; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) wished all the old troubles back again, for then it
mattered more to Adam what his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother said and did.
<div class="bookquote">``Eh, it's fine talkin' o' dancin',''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``an' thy father not a
five week in's grave. An' I wish I war there too, i'stid o' bein' left to
take up merrier folks's room above ground.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nay, don't look at it i' that way, Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, who was
determined to be gentle to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to-day. <div class="bookquote">``I don't mean to dance--I
shall only look on. And since the captain wishes me to be there, it
'ud look as if I thought I knew better than him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) to say as I'd rather
not stay. And thee know'st how he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'s behaved to me to-day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Eh, thee 't do as thee lik'st, for thy old mother's got no right t'
hinder thee. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s nought but th' old husk, and thee 'st slipped
away from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), like the ripe nut.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, <div class="bookquote">``I'll go and tell the captain as it
hurts thy feelings for me to stay, and I'd rather go home upo' that
account: he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) won't take it ill then, I daresay, and I'm willing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
said this with some effort, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) really longed to be near Hetty this
evening.
<div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay, I wonna ha' thee do that--the young squire 'ull be
angered. Go an' do what thee 't ordered to do, an' me and Seth 'ull
go whome. I know it's a grit honour for thee to be so looked on--
an' who's to be prouder on it nor thy mother? Hadna she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) the
cumber o' rearin' thee an' doin' for thee all these 'ears?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, good-bye, then, Mother--good-bye, lad--remember Gyp
when you get home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, turning away towards the gate of
the pleasure-grounds, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) might be able to join the
Poysers, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had been so occupied throughout the afternoon



<p/>371

<p/>that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had had no time to speak to Hetty. His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) eye soon detected a
distant group, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) knew to be the right one, returning to the
house along the broad gravel road, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hastened on to meet
them.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, Adam, I'm glad to get sight on y' again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser,
who was carrying Totty on his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) arm. <div class="bookquote">``You're going t' have a bit o'
fun, I hope, now your work's all done. And here's Hetty has
promised no end o' partners, an' I've just been askin' her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'d
agreed to dance wi' you, an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) says no.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I didn't think o' dancing to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, already
tempted to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mind, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) looked at Hetty.
<div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser. <div class="bookquote">``Why, everybody's goin' to dance
to-night, all but th' old squire and Mrs. Irwine. Mrs. Best's been
tellin' us as Miss Lyddy and Miss Irwine 'ull dance, an' the young
squire 'ull pick my wife for his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) first partner, t' open the ball: so
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'ll be forced to dance, though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s laid by ever sin' the
Christmas afore the little un was born. You canna for shame stand
still, Adam, an' you a fine young fellow and can dance as well as
anybody.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser, <div class="bookquote">``it 'ud be unbecomin'. I know the
dancin's nonsense, but if you stick at everything because it's
nonsense, you wonna go far i' this life. When your broth's readymade for you, you mun swallow the thickenin', or else let the broth
alone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then if Hetty 'ull dance with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, yielding either
to Mrs. Poyser's argument or to something else, <div class="bookquote">``I'll dance
whichever dance she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s free.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I've got no partner for the fourth dance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>said Hetty; <div class="bookquote">``I'll
dance that with you, if you like.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div><p/>372

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser, <div class="bookquote">``but you mun dance the first dance,
Adam, else it'll look partic'ler. There's plenty o' nice partners to
pick an' choose from, an' it's hard for the gells when the men stan'
by and don't ask ’em.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>Adam felt the justice of Mr. Poyser's observation: it would not
do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to dance with no one besides Hetty; and remembering
that Jonathan Burge had some reason to feel hurt to-day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>)
resolved to ask Miss Mary to dance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) the first dance, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
had no other partner.
<div class="bookquote">``There's the big clock strikin' eight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser; <div class="bookquote">``we must
make haste in now, else the squire and the ladies 'ull be in afore
us, an' that wouldna look well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>When they had entered the hall, and the three children under
Molly's charge had been seated on the stairs, the folding-doors of
the drawing-room were thrown open, and Arthur entered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
regimentals, leading Mrs. Irwine to a carpet-covered dais
ornamented with hot-house plants, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) and Miss Anne were
to be seated with old Mr. Donnithorne, that they might look on at
the dancing, like the kings and queens in the plays. Arthur had put
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) uniform to please the tenants, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said, who thought as much
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) militia dignity as if it had been an elevation to the
premiership. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had not the least objection to gratify them in that
way: his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) uniform was very advantageous to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) figure.
The old squire, before sitting down, walked round the hall to
greet the tenants and make polite speeches to the wives: he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was
always polite; but the farmers had found out, after long puzzling,
that this polish was one of the signs of hardness. It was observed
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) most elaborate civility to Mrs. Poyser to-night,
inquiring particularly about her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) health, recommending her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) to



<p/>373

<p/>strengthen herself with cold water as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) did, and avoid all drugs.
Mrs. Poyser curtsied and thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) with great self-command,
but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had passed on, she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) whispered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) husband, <div class="bookquote">``I'll
lay my life he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>)'s brewin' some nasty turn against us. Old Harry
doesna wag his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tail so for nothin'.''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>Mr. Poyser had no time to
answer, for now Arthur came up and said, <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Poyser, I'm come
to request the favour of your hand for the first dance; and, Mr.
Poyser, you must let me take you to my aunt, for she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) claims you as
her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) partner.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>The wife's pale cheek flushed with a nervous sense of unwonted
honour as Arthur led her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to the top of the room; but Mr. Poyser, to
whom an extra glass had restored his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) youthful confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
good looks and good dancing, walked along with them quite
proudly, secretly flattering himself that Miss Lydia had never had
a partner in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) life who could lift her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) off the ground as he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) would.
In order to balance the honours given to the two parishes, Miss
Irwine danced with Luke Britton, the largest Broxton farmer, and
Mr. Gawaine led out Mrs. Britton. Mr. Irwine, after seating his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
sister Anne, had gone to the abbey gallery, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) had agreed with
Arthur beforehand, to see how the merriment of the cottagers was
prospering. Meanwhile, all the less distinguished couples had
taken their places: Hetty was led out by the inevitable Mr. Craig,
and Mary Burge by Adam; and now the music struck up, and the
glorious country-dance, best of all dances, began.
Pity it was not a boarded floor! Then the rhythmic stamping of
the thick shoes would have been better than any drums. That
merry stamping, that gracious nodding of the head, that waving
bestowal of the hand--where can we see them now? That simple
dancing of well-covered matrons, laying aside for an hour the



<p/>374

<p/>cares of house and dairy, remembering but not affecting youth,
not jealous but proud of the young maidens by their side--that
holiday sprightliness of portly husbands paying little compliments
to their wives, as if their courting days were come again--those
lads and lasses a little confused and awkward with their partners,
having nothing to say--it would be a pleasant variety to see all that
sometimes, instead of low dresses and large skirts, and scanning
glances exploring costumes, and languid men in lacquered boots
smiling with double meaning.
There was but one thing to mar Martin Poyser's pleasure in this
dance: it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was always in close contact with Luke
Britton, that slovenly farmer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Britton</b></font>) thought of throwing a little
glazed coldness into his (<font color='blue'><b>Britton</b></font>) eye in the crossing of hands; but then, as
Miss Irwine was opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Britton</b></font>) instead of the offensive Luke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
might freeze the wrong person. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) face up to hilarity,
unchilled by moral judgments.
How Hetty's heart beat as Arthur approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had
hardly looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to-day: now he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) must take her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hand. Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
press it? Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would cry if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) no sign of feeling. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was there--he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
hand--yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was pressing it. Hetty turned pale as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) looked up
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) for an instant and met his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) eyes, before the dance carried
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) away. That pale look came upon Arthur like the beginning of
a dull pain, which clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) must dance and smile
and joke all the same. Hetty would look so, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) should never be able to bear it--he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
should be a fool and give way again. Hetty's look did not really
mean so much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) thought: it was only the sign of a struggle
between the desire for him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to notice her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and the dread lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)



<p/>375

<p/>should betray the desire to others. But Hetty's face had a language
that transcended her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) feelings. There are faces which nature
charges with a meaning and pathos not belonging to the single
human soul that flutters beneath them, but speaking the joys and
sorrows of foregone generations--eyes that tell of deep love which
doubtless has been and is somewhere, but not paired with these
eyes--perhaps paired with pale eyes that can say nothing; just as a
national language may be instinct with poetry unfelt by the lips
that use it. That look of Hetty's oppressed Arthur with a dread
which yet had something of a terrible unconfessed delight in it,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) too well. There was a hard task before him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), for
at that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would have given up three years of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
youth for the happiness of abandoning himself without remorse to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) passion for Hetty.
These were the incongruous thoughts in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mind as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) led
Mrs. Poyser, who was panting with fatigue, and secretly resolving
that neither judge nor jury should force her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) to dance another
dance, to take a quiet rest in the dining-room, where supper was
laid out for the guests to come and take it as they chose.
<div class="bookquote">``I've desired Hetty to remember as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s got to dance wi' you,
sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the good innocent woman; <div class="bookquote">``for she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s so thoughtless,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'d be like enough to go an' engage herself for ivery dance. So I
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) not to promise too many.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Mrs. Poyser,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>said Arthur, not without a twinge.
<div class="bookquote">``Now, sit down in this comfortable chair, and here is Mills ready
to give you what you would like best.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hurried away to seek another matronly partner, for due
honour must be paid to the married women before he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) asked any of
the young ones; and the country-dances, and the stamping, and



<p/>376

<p/>the gracious nodding, and the waving of the hands, went on
joyously.
At last the time had come for the fourth dance--longed for by
the strong, grave Adam, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had been a delicate-handed youth
of eighteen; for we are all very much alike when we are in our first
love; and Adam had hardly ever touched Hetty's hand for more
than a transient greeting--had never danced with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) but once
before. His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) eyes had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eagerly to-night in spite of
himself, and had taken in deeper draughts of love. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
behaved so prettily, so quietly; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) did not seem to be flirting at all
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) smiled less than usual; there was almost a sweet sadness about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``God bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said inwardly; <div class="bookquote">``I'd make her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) life a happy
'un, if a strong arm to work for her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>), and a heart to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>), could
do it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then there stole over him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) delicious thoughts of coming
home from work, and drawing Hetty to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) side, and feeling her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
cheek softly pressed against his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), till he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) forgot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was, and
the music and the tread of feet might have been the falling of rain
and the roaring of the wind, for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) knew.
But now the third dance was ended, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) might go up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
and claim her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was at the far end of the hall near the
staircase, whispering with Molly, who had just given the sleeping
Totty into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) arms before running to fetch shawls and bonnets
from the landing. Mrs. Poyser had taken the two boys away into
the dining-room to give them some cake before they went home in
the cart with Grandfather and Molly was to follow as fast as
possible.
<div class="bookquote">``Let me hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, as Molly turned upstairs; <div class="bookquote">``the
children are so heavy when they're asleep.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Molly</b></font>)</div><p/>377

<p/>Hetty was glad of the relief, for to hold Totty in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) arms,
standing, was not at all a pleasant variety to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). But this second
transfer had the unfortunate effect of rousing Totty, who was not
behind any child of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) age in peevishness at an unseasonable
awaking. While Hetty was in the act of placing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) in Adam's
arms, and had not yet withdrawn her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) own, Totty opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eyes,
and forthwith fought out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) left fist at Adam's arm, and with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) right caught at the string of brown beads round Hetty's neck.
The locket leaped out from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) frock, and the next moment the
string was broken, and Hetty, helpless, saw beads and locket
scattered wide on the floor.
<div class="bookquote">``My locket, my locket!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said, in a loud frightened whisper to
Adam; <div class="bookquote">``never mind the beads.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam had already seen where the locket fell, for it had
attracted his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) glance as it leaped out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) frock. It had fallen on
the raised wooden dais where the band sat, not on the stone floor;
and as Adam picked it up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) saw the glass with the dark and light
locks of hair under it. It had fallen that side upwards, so the glass
was not broken. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) turned it over on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hand, and saw the
enamelled gold back.
<div class="bookquote">``It isn't hurt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) held it towards Hetty, who was
unable to take it because both her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hands were occupied with
Totty.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, it doesn't matter, I don't mind about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>said Hetty, who
had been pale and was now red.
<div class="bookquote">``Not matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, gravely. <div class="bookquote">``You seemed very
frightened about it. I'll hold it till you're ready to take it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
added, quietly closing his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hand over it, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) might not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
wanted to look at it again.



<p/>378

<p/>By this time Molly had come with bonnet and shawl, and as
soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had taken Totty, Adam placed the locket in Hetty's
hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) took it with an air of indifference and put it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
pocket, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heart vexed and angry with Adam because he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had
seen it, but determined now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would show no more signs of
agitation.
<div class="bookquote">``See,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``they're taking their places to dance; let us go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Adam assented silently. A puzzled alarm had taken possession
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). Had Hetty a lover he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) didn't know of? For none of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
relations, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was sure, would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) a locket like that; and none
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) admirers, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was acquainted, was in the position
of an accepted lover, as the giver of that locket must be. Adam was
lost in the utter impossibility of finding any person for his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) fears to
alight on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could only feel with a terrible pang that there was
something in Hetty's life unknown to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>); that while he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had been
rocking himself in the hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would come to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
was already loving another. The pleasure of the dance with Hetty
was gone; his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) eyes, when they rested on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), had an uneasy
questioning expression in them; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could think of nothing to say to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) too was out of temper and disinclined to speak. They
were both glad when the dance was ended.
Adam was determined to stay no longer; no one wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>),
and no one would notice if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) slipped away. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) got out
of doors, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) began to walk at his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) habitual rapid pace, hurrying
along without knowing why, busy with the painful thought that the
memory of this day, so full of honour and promise to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), was
poisoned for ever. Suddenly, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was far on through the
Chase, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) stopped, startled by a flash of reviving hope. After all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>)
might be a fool, making a great misery out of a trifle. Hetty, fond of



<p/>379

<p/>finery as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was, might have bought the thing herself. It looked
too expensive for that--it looked like the things on white satin in
the great jeweller's shop at Rosseter. But Adam had very
imperfect notions of the value of such things, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought it
could certainly not cost more than a guinea. Perhaps Hetty had
had as much as that in Christmas boxes, and there was no
knowing but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) might have been childish enough to spend it in
that way; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was such a young thing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) couldn't help loving
finery! But then, why had she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) been so frightened about it at first,
and changed colour so, and afterwards pretended not to care? Oh,
that was because she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had such
a smart thing--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was conscious that it was wrong for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to
spend her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) money on it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knew that Adam disapproved of
finery. It was a proof she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cared about what he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) liked and disliked.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) must have thought from his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) silence and gravity afterwards
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was very much displeased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was inclined to
be harsh and severe towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) foibles. And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) walked on
more quietly, chewing the cud of this new hope, his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) only
uneasiness was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had behaved in a way which might chill
Hetty's feeling towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). For this last view of the matter must
be the true one. How could Hetty have an accepted lover, quite
unknown to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was never away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) uncle's house for
more than a day; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could have no acquaintances that did not
come there, and no intimacies unknown to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) uncle and aunt. It
would be folly to believe that the locket was given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) by a
lover. The little ring of dark hair he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) felt sure was her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) own; he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
could form no guess about the light hair under it, for he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had not
seen it very distinctly. It might be a bit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) father's or mother's,
who had died when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was a child, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would naturally put a



<p/>380

<p/>bit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) own along with it.
And so Adam went to bed comforted, having woven for himself
an ingenious web of probabilities--the surest screen a wise man
can place between himself and the truth. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last waking thoughts
melted into a dream that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was with Hetty again at the Hall
Farm, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>) was asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>) for being so cold
and silent.
And while he (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>) was dreaming this, Arthur was leading Hetty to
the dance and saying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) in low hurried tones, <div class="bookquote">``I shall be in the
wood the day after to-morrow at seven; come as early as you can.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>And Hetty's foolish joys and hopes, which had flown away for a
little space, scared by a mere nothing, now all came fluttering
back, unconscious of the real peril. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was happy for the first
time this long day, and wished that dance would last for hours.
Arthur wished it too; it was the last weakness he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) meant to indulge
in; and a man never lies with more delicious languor under the
influence of a passion than when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has persuaded himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
shall subdue it to-morrow.
But Mrs. Poyser's wishes were quite the reverse of this, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
mind was filled with dreary forebodings as to the retardation of tomorrow morning's cheese in consequence of these late hours. Now
that Hetty had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) duty and danced one dance with the
young squire, Mr. Poyser must go out and see if the cart was come
back to fetch them, for it was half-past ten o’clock, and
notwithstanding a mild suggestion on his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) part that it would be bad
manners for them to be the first to go, Mrs. Poyser was resolute on
the point, <div class="bookquote">``manners or no manners.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What! Going already, Mrs. Poyser?''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>said old Mr. Donnithorne,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) came to curtsy and take leave; ``I thought we should not



<p/>381

<p/>part with any of our guests till eleven. Mrs. Irwine and I, who are
elderly people, think of sitting out the dance till then.''
``Oh, Your Honour, it's all right and proper for gentlefolks to
stay up by candlelight--they've got no cheese on their minds.
We're late enough as it is, an' there's no lettin' the cows know as
they mustn't want to be milked so early to-morrow mornin'. So, if
you'll please t' excuse us, we'll take our leave.''
``Eh!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) husband, as they set off in the cart, ``I'd
sooner ha' brewin' day and washin' day together than one o' these
pleasurin' days. There's no work so tirin' as danglin' about an'
starin' an' not rightly knowin' what you're goin' to do next; and
keepin' your face i' smilin' order like a grocer o' market-day for
fear people shouldna think you civil enough. An' you've nothing to
show for 't when it's done, if it isn't a yallow face wi' eatin' things
as disagree.''
``Nay, nay,'' said Mr. Poyser, who was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) merriest mood, and
felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) had had a great day, <div class="bookquote">``a bit o' pleasuring's good for thee
sometimes. An' thee danc'st as well as any of ’em, for I'll back thee
against all the wives i' the parish for a light foot an' ankle. An' it
was a great honour for the young squire to ask thee first--I reckon
it was because I sat at th' head o' the table an' made the speech.
An' Hetty too--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) never had such a partner before--a fine young
gentleman in reg'mentals. It'll serve you to talk on, Hetty, when
you're an old woman--how you danced wi' th' young squire the
day he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) come o' age.''

<p/>Chapter XXVII
A Crisis

<p/>I

<p/>t was beyond the middle of August--nearly three weeks after
the birthday feast. The reaping of the wheat had begun in our
north midland county of Loamshire, but the harvest was likely
still to be retarded by the heavy rains, which were causing
inundations and much damage throughout the country. From this
last trouble the Broxton and Hayslope farmers, on their pleasant
uplands and in their brook-watered valleys, had not suffered, and
as I cannot pretend that they were such exceptional farmers as to
love the general good better than their own, you will infer that
they were not in very low spirits about the rapid rise in the price of
bread, so long as there was hope of gathering in their own corn
undamaged; and occasional days of sunshine and drying winds
flattered this hope.
The eighteenth of August was one of these days when the
sunshine looked brighter in all eyes for the gloom that went
before. Grand masses of cloud were hurried across the blue, and
the great round hills behind the Chase seemed alive with their
flying shadows; the sun was hidden for a moment, and then shone
out warm again like a recovered joy; the leaves, still green, were
tossed off the hedgerow trees by the wind; around the farmhouses
there was a sound of clapping doors; the apples fell in the
orchards; and the stray horses on the green sides of the lanes and
on the common had their manes blown about their faces. And yet
the wind seemed only part of the general gladness because the sun




<p/>384

<p/>was shining. A merry day for the children, who ran and shouted to
see if they could top the wind with their voices; and the grown-up
people too were in good spirits, inclined to believe in yet finer
days, when the wind had fallen. If only the corn were not ripe
enough to be blown out of the husk and scattered as untimely
seed!
And yet a day on which a blighting sorrow may fall upon a man.
For if it be true that Nature at certain moments seems charged
with a presentiment of one individual lot must it not also be true
that she (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>) seems unmindful unconscious of another? For there is no
hour that has not its births of gladness and despair, no morning
brightness that does not bring new sickness to desolation as well
as new forces to genius and love. There are so many of us, and our
lots are so different, what wonder that Nature's mood is often in
harsh contrast with the great crisis of our lives? We are children of
a large family, and must learn, as such children do, not to expect
that our hurts will be made much of--to be content with little
nurture and caressing, and help each other the more.
It was a busy day with Adam, who of late had done almost
double work, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was continuing to act as foreman for Jonathan
Burge, until some satisfactory person could be found to supply his (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>)
place, and Jonathan was slow to find that person. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>) had done
the extra work cheerfully, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>) hopes were buoyant again about
Hetty. Every time she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>) since the birthday, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had
seemed to make an effort to behave all the more kindly to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>),
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) might make him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>) understand she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had forgiven his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>) silence
and coldness during the dance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>) had never mentioned the
locket to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) again; too happy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>)--still happier
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>) observed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) a more subdued air, something that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>)



<p/>385

<p/>interpreted as the growth of womanly tenderness and seriousness.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>) thought, again and again, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s only seventeen; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'ll be
thoughtful enough after a while. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt allays says how
clever she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) is at the work. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'ll make a wife as Mother'll have no
occasion to grumble at, after all.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>To be sure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>) had only seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
at home twice since the birthday; for one Sunday, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>) was
intending to go from church to the Hall Farm, Hetty had joined
the party of upper servants from the Chase and had gone home
with them--almost as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) were inclined to encourage Mr. Craig.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s takin' too much likin' to them folks i' the house keeper's
room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Poyser remarked. <div class="bookquote">``For my part, I was never overfond o' gentlefolks's servants--they're mostly like the fine ladies'
fat dogs, nayther good for barking nor butcher's meat, but on'y for
show.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And another evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was gone to Treddleston to buy
some things; though, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) great surprise, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) was returning
home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) at a distance getting over a stile quite out of the
Treddleston road. But, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) hastened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was very
kind, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) to go in again when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) to the
yard gate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) had gone a little farther into the fields after coming
from Treddleston because she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) didn't want to go in, she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) said: it was
so nice to be out of doors, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) aunt always made such a fuss
about it if she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) wanted to go out. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, do come in with me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) was going to shake hands with her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) at the gate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>)
could not resist that. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) went in, and Mrs. Poyser was
contented with only a slight remark on Hetty's being later than
was expected; while Hetty, who had looked out of spirits when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>)
met her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), smiled and talked and waited on them all with unusual
promptitude.
That was the last time he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) meant to make



<p/>386

<p/>leisure for going to the Farm to-morrow. To-day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) knew, was her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
day for going to the Chase to sew with the lady's maid, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) would
get as much work done as possible this evening, that the next
might be clear.
One piece of work that Adam was superintending was some
slight repairs at the Chase Farm, which had been hitherto
occupied by Satchell, as bailiff, but which it was now rumoured
that the old squire was going to let to a smart man in top-boots,
who had been seen to ride over it one day. Nothing but the desire
to get a tenant could account for the squire's undertaking repairs,
though the Saturday-evening party at Mr. Casson's agreed over
their pipes that no man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) senses would take the Chase Farm
unless there was a bit more plough-land laid to it. However that
might be, the repairs were ordered to be executed with all
dispatch, and Adam, acting for Mr. Burge, was carrying out the
order with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) usual energy. But to-day, having been occupied
elsewhere, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had not been able to arrive at the Chase Farm till
late in the afternoon, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) then discovered that some old
roofing, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) had calculated on preserving, had given way.
There was clearly no good to be done with this part of the building
without pulling it all down, and Adam immediately saw in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
mind a plan for building it up again, so as to make the most
convenient of cow-sheds and calf-pens, with a hovel for
implements; and all without any great expense for materials. So,
when the workmen were gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) sat down, took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) pocketbook, and busied himself with sketching a plan, and making a
specification of the expenses that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) might show it to Burge the
next morning, and set him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) on persuading the squire to consent. To
<div class="bookquote">``make a good job''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>of anything, however small, was always a



<p/>387

<p/>pleasure to Adam, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) sat on a block, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) book resting on a
planing-table, whistling low every now and then and turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
head on one side with a just perceptible smile of gratification--of
pride, too, for if Adam loved a bit of good work, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) loved also to
think, <div class="bookquote">``I did it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And I believe the only people who are free from
that weakness are those who have no work to call their own. It was
nearly seven before he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had finished and put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) jacket again;
and on giving a last look round, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) observed that Seth, who had
been working here to-day, had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) basket of tools behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Why, th' lad's forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) tools,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>thought Adam, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'s got to
work up at the shop to-morrow. There never was such a chap for
wool-gathering; he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'d leave his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) head behind him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>), if it was loose.
However, it's lucky I've seen ’em; I'll carry ’em home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>The buildings of the Chase Farm lay at one extremity of the
Chase, at about ten minutes' walking distance from the Abbey.
Adam had come thither on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) pony, intending to ride to the
stables and put up his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) nag on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) way home. At the stables he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
encountered Mr. Craig, who had come to look at the captain's new
horse, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was to ride away the day after to-morrow; and
Mr. Craig detained him (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) to tell how all the servants were to collect
at the gate of the courtyard to wish the young squire luck as he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>)
rode out; so that by the time Adam had got into the Chase, and
was striding along with the basket of tools over his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) shoulder, the
sun was on the point of setting, and was sending level crimson
rays among the great trunks of the old oaks, and touching every
bare patch of ground with a transient glory that made it look like a
jewel dropt upon the grass. The wind had fallen now, and there
was only enough breeze to stir the delicate-stemmed leaves. Any
one who had been sitting in the house all day would have been



<p/>388

<p/>glad to walk now; but Adam had been quite enough in the open air
to wish to shorten his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) way home, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) bethought himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
might do so by striking across the Chase and going through the
Grove, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) had never been for years. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) hurried on across
the Chase, stalking along the narrow paths between the fern, with
Gyp at his (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) heels, not lingering to watch the magnificent changes of
the light--hardly once thinking of it--yet feeling its presence in a
certain calm happy awe which mingled itself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) busy
working-day thoughts. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) help feeling it? The very
deer felt it, and were more timid.
Presently Adam's thoughts recurred to what Mr. Craig had said
about Arthur Donnithorne, and pictured his (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) going away, and the
changes that might take place before he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) came back; then they
travelled back affectionately over the old scenes of boyish
companionship, and dwelt on Arthur's good qualities, which Adam
had a pride in, as we all have in the virtues of the superior who
honours us. A nature like Adam's, with a great need of love and
reverence in it, depends for so much of its happiness on what it
can believe and feel about others! And he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had no ideal world of
dead heroes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) knew little of the life of men in the past; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) must
find the beings to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could cling with loving admiration
among those who came within speech of him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). These pleasant
thoughts about Arthur brought a milder expression than usual
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) keen rough face: perhaps they were the reason why, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) opened the old green gate leading into the Grove, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) paused to
pat Gyp and say a kind word to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).
After that pause, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) strode on again along the broad winding
path through the Grove. What grand beeches! Adam delighted in a
fine tree of all things; as the fisherman's sight is keenest on the



<p/>389

<p/>sea, so Adam's perceptions were more at home with trees than
with other objects. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) kept them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) memory, as a painter does,
with all the flecks and knots in their bark, all the curves and
angles of their boughs, and had often calculated the height and
contents of a trunk to a nicety, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) stood looking at it. No wonder
that, not-withstanding his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) desire to get on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could not help
pausing to look at a curious large beech which he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had seen
standing before him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) at a turning in the road, and convince himself
that it was not two trees wedded together, but only one. For the
rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) remembered that moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was calmly
examining the beech, as a man remembers his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last glimpse of the
home where his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) youth was passed, before the road turned, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
saw it no more. The beech stood at the last turning before the
Grove ended in an archway of boughs that let in the eastern light;
and as Adam stepped away from the tree to continue his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) walk, his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
eyes fell on two figures about twenty yards before him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) remained as motionless as a statue, and turned almost as
pale. The two figures were standing opposite to each other, with
clasped hands about to part; and while they were bending to kiss,
Gyp, who had been running among the brushwood, came out,
caught sight of them, and gave a sharp bark. They separated with
a start--one hurried through the gate out of the Grove, and the
other, turning round, walked slowly, with a sort of saunter,
towards Adam who still stood transfixed and pale, clutching
tighter the stick with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) held the basket of tools over his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
shoulder, and looking at the approaching figure with eyes in which
amazement was fast turning to fierceness.
Arthur Donnithorne looked flushed and excited; he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) had tried to
make unpleasant feelings more bearable by drinking a little more



<p/>390

<p/>wine than usual at dinner to-day, and was still enough under its
flattering influence to think more lightly of this unwished-for
rencontre with Adam than he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would otherwise have done. After
all, Adam was the best person who could have happened to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) and Hetty together--he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was a sensible fellow, and would not
babble about it to other people. Arthur felt confident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could
laugh the thing off and explain it away. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sauntered
forward with elaborate carelessness--his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) flushed face, his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) evening
dress of fine cloth and fine linen, his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hands half-thrust into his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
waistcoat pockets, all shone upon by the strange evening light
which the light clouds had caught up even to the zenith, and were
now shedding down between the topmost branches above him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).
Adam was still motionless, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) came up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
understood it all now--the locket and everything else that had
been doubtful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>): a terrible scorching light showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) the
hidden letters that changed the meaning of the past. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had
moved a muscle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) must inevitably have sprung upon Arthur like
a tiger; and in the conflicting emotions that filled those long
moments, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had told himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would not give loose to
passion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would only speak the right thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) stood as if
petrified by an unseen force, but the force was his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own strong will.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, Adam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>said Arthur, <div class="bookquote">``you've been looking at the fine old
beeches, eh? They're not to be come near by the hatchet, though;
this is a sacred grove. I overtook pretty little Hetty Sorrel as I was
coming to my den--the Hermitage, there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>) ought not to come
home this way so late. So I took care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>) to the gate, and asked
for a kiss for my pains. But I must get back now, for this road is
confoundedly damp. Good-night, Adam. I shall see you tomorrow--to say good-bye, you know.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div><p/>391

<p/>Arthur was too much preoccupied with the part he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was playing
himself to be thoroughly aware of the expression in Adam's face.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) did not look directly at Adam, but glanced carelessly round at
the trees and then lifted up one foot to look at the sole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) boot.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) cared to say no more--he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had thrown quite dust enough into
honest Adam's eyes--and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) spoke the last words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) walked
on.
<div class="bookquote">``Stop a bit, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, in a hard peremptory voice,
without turning round. <div class="bookquote">``I've got a word to say to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>Arthur paused in surprise. Susceptible persons are more
affected by a change of tone than by unexpected words, and
Arthur had the susceptibility of a nature at once affectionate and
vain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was still more surprised when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) saw that Adam had not
moved, but stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), as if summoning him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to
return. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mean? He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was going to make a serious
business of this affair. Arthur felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) temper rising. A patronising
disposition always has its meaner side, and in the confusion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
irritation and alarm there entered the feeling that a man to whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had shown so much favour as to Adam was not in a position to
criticise his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) conduct. And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was dominated, as one who feels
himself in the wrong always is, by the man whose good opinion he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
cares for. In spite of pride and temper, there was as much
deprecation as anger in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``What do you
mean, Adam?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I mean, sir'' (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>--answered Adam, in the same harsh voice, still
without turning round--<div class="bookquote">``I mean, sir, that you don't deceive me by
your light words. This is not the first time you've met Hetty Sorrel
in this grove, and this is not the first time you've kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Arthur felt a startled uncertainty how far Adam was speaking



<p/>392

<p/>from knowledge, and how far from mere inference. And this
uncertainty, which prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) from contriving a prudent
answer, heightened his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) irritation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, in a high sharp tone,
<div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, what then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, then, instead of acting like th' upright, honourable man
we've all believed you to be, you've been acting the part of a selfish
light-minded scoundrel. You know as well as I do what it's to lead
to when a gentleman like you kisses and makes love to a young
woman like Hetty, and gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) presents as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s frightened for
other folks to see. And I say it again, you're acting the part of a
selfish light-minded scoundrel though it cuts me to th' heart to say
so, and I'd rather ha' lost my right hand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let me tell you, Adam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>said Arthur, bridling his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) growing
anger and trying to recur to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) careless tone, <div class="bookquote">``you're not only
devilishly impertinent, but you're talking nonsense. Every pretty
girl is not such a fool as you, to suppose that when a gentleman
admires her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) beauty and pays her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a little attention, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) must mean
something particular. Every man likes to flirt with a pretty girl,
and every pretty girl likes to be flirted with. The wider the
distance between them, the less harm there is, for then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s not
likely to deceive herself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean by flirting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, ``but if
you mean behaving to a woman as if you loved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and yet not
loving her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) all the while, I say that's not th' action of an honest
man, and what isn't honest does come t' harm. I'm not a fool, and
you're not a fool, and you know better than what you're saying.
You know it couldn't be made public as you've behaved to Hetty as
y' have done without her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) character and bringing shame
and trouble on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) relations. What if you meant nothing



<p/>393

<p/>by your kissing and your presents? Other folks won't believe as
you've meant nothing; and don't tell me about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) not deceiving
herself. I tell you as you've filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mind so with the thought of
you as it'll mayhap poison her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) life, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'ll never love another
man as 'ud make her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) a good husband.''
Arthur had felt a sudden relief while Adam was speaking; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
perceived that Adam had no positive knowledge of the past, and
that there was no irrevocable damage done by this evening's
unfortunate rencontre. Adam could still be deceived. The candid
Arthur had brought himself into a position in which successful
lying was his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) only hope. The hope allayed his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) anger a little.
``Well, Adam,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said, in a tone of friendly concession, ``you're
perhaps right. Perhaps I've gone a little too far in taking notice of
the pretty little thing and stealing a kiss now and then. You're
such a grave, steady fellow, you don't understand the temptation
to such trifling. I'm sure I wouldn't bring any trouble or
annoyance on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and the good Poysers on any account if I could
help it. But I think you look a little too seriously at it. You know
I'm going away immediately, so I shan't make any more mistakes
of the kind. But let us say good-night''--Arthur here turned round
to walk on--``and talk no more about the matter. The whole thing
will soon be forgotten.''
<div class="bookquote">``No, by God!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Adam burst out with rage that could be
controlled no longer, throwing down the basket of tools and
striding forward till he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was right in front of Arthur. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) jealousy
and sense of personal injury, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had been hitherto trying to
keep under, had leaped up and mastered him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). What man of us, in
the first moments of a sharp agony, could ever feel that the fellowman who has been the medium of inflicting it did not mean to hurt



<p/>394

<p/>us? In our instinctive rebellion against pain, we are children again,
and demand an active will to wreak our vengeance on. Adam at
this moment could only feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had been robbed of Hetty--
robbed treacherously by the man in whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had trusted--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
stood close in front of Arthur, with fierce eyes glaring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), with
pale lips and clenched hands, the hard tones in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had
hitherto been constraining himself to express no more than a just
indignation giving way to a deep agitated voice that seemed to
shake him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) spoke.
<div class="bookquote">``No, it'll not be soon forgot, as you've come in between her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and
me, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) might ha' loved me--it'll not soon be forgot as
you've robbed me o' my happiness, while I thought you was my
best friend, and a noble-minded man, as I was proud to work for.
And you've been kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), and meaning nothing, have you?
And I never kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) i' my life--but I'd ha' worked hard for
years for the right to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). And you make light of it. You think
little o' doing what may damage other folks, so as you get your bit
o' trifling, as means nothing. I throw back your favours, for you're
not the man I took you for. I'll never count you my friend any
more. I'd rather you'd act as my enemy, and fight me where I
stand--it's all th' amends you can make me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Poor Adam, possessed by rage that could find no other vent,
began to throw off his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) coat and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) cap, too blind with passion to
notice the change that had taken place in Arthur while he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was
speaking. Arthur's lips were now as pale as Adam's; his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) heart was
beating violently. The discovery that Adam loved Hetty was a
shock which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) for the moment see himself in the light of
Adam's indignation, and regard Adam's suffering as not merely a
consequence, but an element of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) error. The words of hatred and



<p/>395

<p/>contempt--the first he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had ever heard in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) life--seemed like
scorching missiles that were making ineffaceable scars on him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). All
screening self-excuse, which rarely falls quite away while others
respect us, forsook him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) for an instant, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) stood face to face
with the first great irrevocable evil he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had ever committed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was
only twenty-one, and three months ago--nay, much later--he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had
thought proudly that no man should ever be able to reproach him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
justly. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first impulse, if there had been time for it, would
perhaps have been to utter words of propitiation; but Adam had
no sooner thrown off his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) coat and cap than he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) became aware that
Arthur was standing pale and motionless, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hands still
thrust in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) waistcoat pockets.
<div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``won't you fight me like a man? You know I
won't strike you while you stand so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go away, Adam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>said Arthur, <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to fight you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, bitterly; <div class="bookquote">``you don't want to fight me--you
think I'm a common man, as you can injure without answering for
it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I never meant to injure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>said Arthur, with returning
anger. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't know you loved her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you've made her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) love you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam. <div class="bookquote">``You're a doublefaced man--I'll never believe a word you say again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go away, I tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>said Arthur, angrily, <div class="bookquote">``or we shall both
repent.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, with a convulsed voice, <div class="bookquote">``I swear I won't go
away without fighting you. Do you want provoking any more? I tell
you you're a coward and a scoundrel, and I despise you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>The colour had all rushed back to Arthur's face; in a moment
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) right hand was clenched, and dealt a blow like lightning, which



<p/>396

<p/>sent Adam staggering backward. His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) blood was as thoroughly up
as Adam's now, and the two men, forgetting the emotions that had
gone before, fought with the instinctive fierceness of panthers in
the deepening twilight darkened by the trees. The delicate-handed
gentleman was a match for the workman in everything but
strength, and Arthur's skill enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to protract the struggle
for some long moments. But between unarmed men the battle is to
the strong, where the strong is no blunderer, and Arthur must
sink under a well-planted blow of Adam's as a steel rod is broken
by an iron bar. The blow soon came, and Arthur fell, his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) head lying
concealed in a tuft of fern, so that Adam could only discern his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
darkly clad body.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) stood still in the dim light waiting for Arthur to rise.
The blow had been given now, towards which he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had been
straining all the force of nerve and muscle--and what was the
good of it? What had he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) done by fighting? Only satisfied his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own
passion, only wreaked his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own vengeance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had not rescued
Hetty, nor changed the past--there it was, just as it had been, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sickened at the vanity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own rage.
But why did not Arthur rise? He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was perfectly motionless, and
the time seemed long to Adam. Good God! had the blow been too
much for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)? Adam shuddered at the thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) own
strength, as with the oncoming of this dread he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) knelt down by
Arthur's side and lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) head from among the fern. There was
no sign of life: the eyes and teeth were set. The horror that rushed
over Adam completely mastered him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), and forced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) its own
belief. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could feel nothing but that death was in Arthur's face,
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was helpless before it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) made not a single
movement, but knelt like an image of despair gazing at an image



<p/>397

<p/>of death.




<p/>398

<p/>Chapter XXVIII
A Dilemma

<p/>I

<p/>t was only a few minutes measured by the clock--though
Adam always thought it had been a long while--before he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
perceived a gleam of consciousness in Arthur's face and a
slight shiver through his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) frame. The intense joy that flooded his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
soul brought back some of the old affection with it.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you feel any pain, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said, tenderly, loosening
Arthur's cravat.
Arthur turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) eyes on Adam with a vague stare which gave
way to a slightly startled motion as if from the shock of returning
memory. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) only shivered again and said nothing.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you feel any hurt, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam said again, with a trembling
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) voice.
Arthur put his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hand up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) waistcoat buttons, and when
Adam had unbuttoned it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) took a longer breath. <div class="bookquote">``Lay my head
down,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, faintly, <div class="bookquote">``and get me some water if you can.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Adam laid the head down gently on the fern again, and
emptying the tools out of the flag-basket, hurried through the trees
to the edge of the Grove bordering on the Chase, where a brook
ran below the bank.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) returned with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) basket leaking, but still half-full,
Arthur looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) with a more thoroughly reawakened
consciousness.
<div class="bookquote">``Can you drink a drop out o' your hand, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam,
kneeling down again to lift up Arthur's head.




<p/>399

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>said Arthur, <div class="bookquote">``dip my cravat in and souse it on my head.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>The water seemed to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) some good, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) presently raised
himself a little higher, resting on Adam's arm.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you feel any hurt inside sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam asked again
<div class="bookquote">``No--no hurt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Arthur, still faintly, <div class="bookquote">``but rather done up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>After a while he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose I fainted away when you
knocked me down.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, thank God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam. <div class="bookquote">``I thought it was worse.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What! You thought you'd done for me, eh? Come help me on
my legs.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I feel terribly shaky and dizzy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>Arthur said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) stood
leaning on Adam's arm; <div class="bookquote">``that blow of yours must have come
against me like a battering-ram. I don't believe I can walk alone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Lean on me, sir; I'll get you along,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam. <div class="bookquote">``Or, will you sit
down a bit longer, on my coat here, and I'll prop y' up. You'll
perhaps be better in a minute or two.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>said Arthur. <div class="bookquote">``I'll go to the Hermitage--I think I've got
some brandy there. There's a short road to it a little farther on,
near the gate. If you'll just help me on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They walked slowly, with frequent pauses, but without
speaking again. In both of them, the concentration in the present
which had attended the first moments of Arthur's revival had now
given way to a vivid recollection of the previous scene. It was
nearly dark in the narrow path among the trees, but within the
circle of fir-trees round the Hermitage there was room for the
growing moonlight to enter in at the windows. Their steps were
noiseless on the thick carpet of fir-needles, and the outward
stillness seemed to heighten their inward consciousness, as Arthur
took the key out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) pocket and placed it in Adam's hand, for



<p/>400

<p/>him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to open the door. Adam had not known before that Arthur
had furnished the old Hermitage and made it a retreat for himself,
and it was a surprise to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) opened the door to see a
snug room with all the signs of frequent habitation.
Arthur loosed Adam's arm and threw himself on the ottoman.
<div class="bookquote">``You'll see my hunting-bottle somewhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``A leather
case with a bottle and glass in.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam was not long in finding the case. <div class="bookquote">``There's very little
brandy in it, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, turning it downwards over the glass, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) held it before the window; <div class="bookquote">``hardly this little glassful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, give me that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>said Arthur, with the peevishness of
physical depression. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had taken some sips, Adam said,
<div class="bookquote">``Hadn't I better run to th' house, sir, and get some more brandy? I
can be there and back pretty soon. It'll be a stiff walk home for
you, if you don't have something to revive you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes--go. But don't say I'm ill. Ask for my man Pym, and tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to get it from Mills, and not to say I'm at the Hermitage. Get
some water too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam was relieved to have an active task--both of them were
relieved to be apart from each other for a short time. But Adam's
swift pace could not still the eager pain of thinking--of living again
with concentrated suffering through the last wretched hour, and
looking out from it over all the new sad future.
Arthur lay still for some minutes after Adam was gone, but
presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) rose feebly from the ottoman and peered about slowly
in the broken moonlight, seeking something. It was a short bit of
wax candle that stood amongst a confusion of writing and drawing
materials. There was more searching for the means of lighting the
candle, and when that was done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) went cautiously round the



<p/>401

<p/>room, as if wishing to assure himself of the presence or absence of
something. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had found a slight thing, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) put first in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) pocket, and then, on a second thought, took out again and
thrust deep down into a waste-paper basket. It was a woman's
little, pink, silk neckerchief. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) set the candle on the table, and
threw himself down on the ottoman again, exhausted with the
effort.
When Adam came back with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) supplies, his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) entrance awoke
Arthur from a doze.
<div class="bookquote">``That's right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>Arthur said; <div class="bookquote">``I'm tremendously in want of some
brandy-vigour.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad to see you've got a light, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam. <div class="bookquote">``I've been
thinking I'd better have asked for a lanthorn.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no; the candle will last long enough--I shall soon be up to
walking home now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't go before I've seen you safe home, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam,
hesitatingly.
<div class="bookquote">``No: it will be better for you to stay--sit down.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam sat down, and they remained opposite to each other in
uneasy silence, while Arthur slowly drank brandy-and-water, with
visibly renovating effect. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) began to lie in a more voluntary
position, and looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) were less overpowered by bodily
sensations. Adam was keenly alive to these indications, and as his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
anxiety about Arthur's condition began to be allayed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) felt more
of that impatience which every one knows who has had his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) just
indignation suspended by the physical state of the culprit. Yet
there was one thing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mind to be done before he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could recur
to remonstrance: it was to confess what had been unjust in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
own words. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) longed all the more to make this



<p/>402

<p/>confession, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) indignation might be free again; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) saw
the signs of returning ease in Arthur, the words again and again
came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) lips and went back, checked by the thought that it
would be better to leave everything till to-morrow. As long as they
were silent they did not look at each other, and a foreboding came
across Adam that if they began to speak as though they
remembered the past--if they looked at each other with full
recognition--they must take fire again. So they sat in silence till
the bit of wax candle flickered low in the socket, the silence all the
while becoming more irksome to Adam. Arthur had just poured
out some more brandy-and-water, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) threw one arm behind
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) head and drew up one leg in an attitude of recovered ease,
which was an irresistible temptation to Adam to speak what was
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mind.
<div class="bookquote">``You begin to feel more yourself again, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, as the
candle went out and they were half-hidden from each other in the
faint moonlight.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes: I don't feel good for much--very lazy, and not inclined to
move; but I'll go home when I've taken this dose.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>There was a slight pause before Adam said, <div class="bookquote">``My temper got the
better of me, and I said things as wasn't true. I'd no right to speak
as if you'd known you was doing me an injury: you'd no grounds
for knowing it; I've always kept what I felt for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) as secret as I
could.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) paused again before he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) went on.
``And perhaps I judged you too harsh--I'm apt to be harsh--and
you may have acted out o' thoughtlessness more than I should ha'
believed was possible for a man with a heart and a conscience.
We're not all put together alike, and we may misjudge one



<p/>403

<p/>another. God knows, it's all the joy I could have now, to think the
best of you.''
Arthur wanted to go home without saying any more--he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was
too painfully embarrassed in mind, as well as too weak in body, to
wish for any further explanation to-night. And yet it was a relief to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) that Adam reopened the subject in a way the least difficult for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to answer. Arthur was in the wretched position of an open,
generous man who has committed an error which makes
deception seem a necessity. The native impulse to give truth in
return for truth, to meet trust with frank confession, must be
suppressed, and duty was becoming a question of tactics. His (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) deed
was reacting upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)--was already governing him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) tyrannously
and forcing him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) into a course that jarred with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) habitual feelings.
The only aim that seemed admissible to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) now was to deceive
Adam to the utmost: to make Adam think better of him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) than he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
deserved. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) heard the words of honest retractation--
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) heard the sad appeal with which Adam ended--he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was
obliged to rejoice in the remains of ignorant confidence it implied.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) did not answer immediately, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had to be judicious and not
truthful.
``Say no more about our anger, Adam,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, at last, very
languidly, for the labour of speech was unwelcome to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>); ``I
forgive your momentary injustice--it was quite natural, with the
exaggerated notions you had in your mind. We shall be none the
worse friends in future, I hope, because we've fought. You had the
best of it, and that was as it should be, for I believe I've been most
in the wrong of the two. Come, let us shake hands.''
Arthur held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hand, but Adam sat still.
``I don't like to say `No' to that, sir,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, ``but I can't shake



<p/>404

<p/>hands till it's clear what we mean by 't. I was wrong when I spoke
as if you'd done me an injury knowingly, but I wasn't wrong in
what I said before, about your behaviour t' Hetty, and I can't
shake hands with you as if I held you my friend the same as ever
till you've cleared that up better.''
Arthur swallowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) pride and resentment as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) drew back his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was silent for some moments, and then said, as
indifferently as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could, ``I don't know what you mean by clearing
up, Adam. I've told you already that you think too seriously of a
little flirtation. But if you are right in supposing there is any
danger in it--I'm going away on Saturday, and there will be an
end of it. As for the pain it has given you, I'm heartily sorry for it. I
can say no more.''
Adam said nothing, but rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) chair and stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
face towards one of the windows, as if looking at the blackness of
the moonlit fir-trees; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was in reality conscious of nothing but
the conflict within him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). It was of no use now--his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) resolution not to
speak till to-morrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) must speak there and then. But it was
several minutes before he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) turned round and stepped nearer to
Arthur, standing and looking down on him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) lay.
``It'll be better for me to speak plain,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said, with evident
effort, ``though it's hard work. You see, sir, this isn't a trifle to me,
whatever it may be to you. I'm none o' them men as can go making
love first to one woman and then t' another, and don't think it
much odds which of ’em I take. What I feel for Hetty's a different
sort o' love, such as I believe nobody can know much about but
them as feel it and God as has given it to ’em. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s more nor
everything else to me, all but my conscience and my good name.
And if it's true what you've been saying all along--and if it's only



<p/>405

<p/>been trifling and flirting as you call it, as 'll be put an end to by
your going away--why, then, I'd wait, and hope her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heart 'ud turn
to me after all. I'm loath to think you'd speak false to me, and I'll
believe your word, however things may look.''
``You would be wronging Hetty more than me not to believe it,''
said Arthur, almost violently, starting up from the ottoman and
moving away. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) threw himself into a chair again directly,
saying, more feebly, ``You seem to forget that, in suspecting me,
you are casting imputations upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>).''
``Nay, sir,'' Adam said, in a calmer voice, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) were halfrelieved--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was too straightforward to make a distinction
between a direct falsehood and an indirect one--``Nay, sir, things
don't lie level between Hetty and you. You're acting with your eyes
open, whatever you may do; but how do you know what's been in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mind? She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s all but a child--as any man with a conscience in
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to feel bound to take care on. And whatever you may
think, I know you've disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mind. I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s been fixing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heart on you, for there's a many things clear to me now as I
didn't understand before. But you seem to make light o' what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
may feel--you don't think o' that.''
``Good God, Adam, let me alone!'' Arthur burst out impetuously;
``I feel it enough without your worrying me.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) indiscretion as soon as the words had
escaped him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).
``Well, then, if you feel it,'' Adam rejoined, eagerly; ``if you feel
as you may ha' put false notions into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mind, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
believe as you loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), when all the while you meant nothing,
I've this demand to make of you--I'm not speaking for myself, but
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). I ask you t' undeceive her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) before you go away. Y' aren't



<p/>406

<p/>going away for ever, and if you leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) behind with a notion in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) head o' your feeling about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) the same as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) feels about you,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'ll be hankering after you, and the mischief may get worse. It
may be a smart to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) now, but it'll save her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) pain i' th' end. I ask
you to write a letter--you may trust to my seeing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) gets it.
Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) the truth, and take blame to yourself for behaving as
you'd no right to do to a young woman as isn't your equal. I speak
plain, sir, but I can't speak any other way. There's nobody can
take care o' Hetty in this thing but me.''
``I can do what I think needful in the matter,'' said Arthur, more
and more irritated by mingled distress and perplexity, ``without
giving promises to you. I shall take what measures I think proper.''
``No,'' said Adam, in an abrupt decided tone, ``that won't do. I
must know what ground I'm treading on. I must be safe as you've
put an end to what ought never to ha' been begun. I don't forget
what's owing to you as a gentleman, but in this thing we're man
and man, and I can't give up.''
There was no answer for some moments. Then Arthur said, ``I'll
see you to-morrow. I can bear no more now; I'm ill.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) rose as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
spoke, and reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) cap, as if intending to go.
``You won't see her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) again!'' Adam exclaimed, with a flash of
recurring anger and suspicion, moving towards the door and
placing his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) back against it. ``Either tell me she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) can never be my
wife--tell me you've been lying--or else promise me what I've
said.''
Adam, uttering this alternative, stood like a terrible fate before
Arthur, who had moved forward a step or two, and now stopped,
faint, shaken, sick in mind and body. It seemed long to both of
them--that inward struggle of Arthur's--before he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said, feebly, ``I



<p/>407

<p/>promise; let me go.''
Adam moved away from the door and opened it, but when
Arthur reached the step, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) stopped again and leaned against the
door-post.
``You're not well enough to walk alone, sir,'' said Adam. ``Take
my arm again.''
Arthur made no answer, and presently walked on, Adam
following. But, after a few steps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) stood still again, and said,
coldly, ``I believe I must trouble you. It's getting late now, and
there may be an alarm set up about me at home.''
Adam gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) arm, and they walked on without uttering a
word, till they came where the basket and the tools lay.
``I must pick up the tools, sir,'' Adam said. ``They're my
brother's. I doubt they'll be rusted. If you'll please to wait a
minute.''
Arthur stood still without speaking, and no other word passed
between them till they were at the side entrance, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hoped
to get in without being seen by any one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said then, ``Thank you;
I needn't trouble you any further.''
``What time will it be conven'ent for me to see you to-morrow,
sir?'' said Adam.
``You may send me word that you're here at five o’clock,'' said
Arthur; ``not before.''
<div class="bookquote">``Good-night, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Adam. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) heard no reply; Arthur
had turned into the house.




<p/>408

<p/>Chapter XXIX
The Next Morning

<p/>A

<p/>rthur did not pass a sleepless night; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) slept long and well.
For sleep comes to the perplexed--if the perplexed are
only weary enough. But at seven he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) rang his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) bell and
astonished Pym by declaring he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was going to get up, and must
have breakfast brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) at eight.
<div class="bookquote">``And see that my mare is saddled at half-past eight, and tell my
grandfather when he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)'s down that I'm better this morning and am
gone for a ride.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had been awake an hour, and could rest in bed no longer. In
bed our yesterdays are too oppressive: if a man can only get up,
though it be but to whistle or to smoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a present which
offers some resistance to the past--sensations which assert
themselves against tyrannous memories. And if there were such a
thing as taking averages of feeling, it would certainly be found that
in the hunting and shooting seasons regret, self-reproach, and
mortified pride weigh lighter on country gentlemen than in late
spring and summer. Arthur felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) should be more of a man
on horseback. Even the presence of Pym, waiting on him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) with the
usual deference, was a reassurance to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) after the scenes of
yesterday. For, with Arthur's sensitiveness to opinion, the loss of
Adam's respect was a shock to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) self-contentment which
suffused his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) imagination with the sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had sunk in all
eyes--as a sudden shock of fear from some real peril makes a
nervous woman afraid even to step, because all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) perceptions




<p/>409

<p/>are suffused with a sense of danger.
Arthur's, as you know, was a loving nature. Deeds of kindness
were as easy to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) as a bad habit: they were the common issue of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) weaknesses and good qualities, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) egoism and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
sympathy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) didn't like to witness pain, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) liked to have
grateful eyes beaming on him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) as the giver of pleasure. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
was a lad of seven, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) one day kicked down an old gardener's
pitcher of broth, from no motive but a kicking impulse, not
reflecting that it was the old man's dinner; but on learning that
sad fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) favourite pencil-case and a silver-hafted knife
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket and offered them as compensation. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been
the same Arthur ever since, trying to make all offences forgotten
in benefits. If there were any bitterness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) nature, it could only
show itself against the man who refused to be conciliated by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
And perhaps the time was come for some of that bitterness to rise.
At the first moment, Arthur had felt pure distress and selfreproach at discovering that Adam's happiness was involved in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
relation to Hetty. If there had been a possibility of making Adam
tenfold amends--if deeds of gift, or any other deeds, could have
restored Adam's contentment and regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) as a benefactor,
Arthur would not only have executed them without hesitation, but
would have felt bound all the more closely to Adam, and would
never have been weary of making retribution. But Adam could
receive no amends; his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) suffering could not be cancelled; his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
respect and affection could not be recovered by any prompt deeds
of atonement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) stood like an immovable obstacle against which
no pressure could avail; an embodiment of what Arthur most
shrank from believing in--the irrevocableness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own
wrongdoing. The words of scorn, the refusal to shake hands, the



<p/>410

<p/>mastery asserted over him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) in their last conversation in the
Hermitage--above all, the sense of having been knocked down, to
which a man does not very well reconcile himself, even under the
most heroic circumstances--pressed on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with a galling pain
which was stronger than compunction. Arthur would so gladly
have persuaded himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had done no harm! And if no one
had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could have persuaded himself so
much better. Nemesis can seldom forge a sword for herself out of
our consciences--out of the suffering we feel in the suffering we
may have caused: there is rarely metal enough there to make an
effective weapon. Our moral sense learns the manners of good
society and smiles when others smile, but when some rude person
gives rough names to our actions, she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) is apt to take part against us.
And so it was with Arthur: Adam's judgment of him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), Adam's
grating words, disturbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) self-soothing arguments.
Not that Arthur had been at ease before Adam's discovery.
Struggles and resolves had transformed themselves into
compunction and anxiety. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was distressed for Hetty's sake, and
distressed for his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) must leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) behind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had
always, both in making and breaking resolutions, looked beyond
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) passion and seen that it must speedily end in separation; but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) nature was too ardent and tender for him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) not to suffer at this
parting; and on Hetty's account he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was filled with uneasiness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
had found out the dream in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was living--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was to
be a lady in silks and satins--and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had first talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) going away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) tremblingly to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) go
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) and be married. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) painful knowledge of this
which had given the most exasperating sting to Adam's
reproaches. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had said no word with the purpose of deceiving



<p/>411

<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)--her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) vision was all spun by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) own childish fancy--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
was obliged to confess to himself that it was spun half out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
own actions. And to increase the mischief, on this last evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
had not dared to hint the truth to Hetty; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had been obliged to
soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) with tender, hopeful words, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) should throw her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
into violent distress. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) felt the situation acutely, felt the sorrow of
the dear thing in the present, and thought with a darker anxiety of
the tenacity which her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) feelings might have in the future. That was
the one sharp point which pressed against him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>); every other he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
could evade by hopeful self-persuasion. The whole thing had been
secret; the Poysers had not the shadow of a suspicion. No one,
except Adam, knew anything of what had passed--no one else was
likely to know; for Arthur had impressed on Hetty that it would be
fatal to betray, by word or look, that there had been the least
intimacy between them; and Adam, who knew half their secret,
would rather help them to keep it than betray it. It was an
unfortunate business altogether, but there was no use in making it
worse than it was by imaginary exaggerations and forebodings of
evil that might never come. The temporary sadness for Hetty was
the worst consequence; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) resolutely turned away his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) eyes from
any bad consequence that was not demonstrably inevitable. But--
but Hetty might have had the trouble in some other way if not in
this. And perhaps hereafter he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) might be able to do a great deal for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and make up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) for all the tears she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would shed about him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would owe the advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) care for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) in future years to
the sorrow she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had incurred now. So good comes out of evil. Such
is the beautiful arrangement of things!
Are you inclined to ask whether this can be the same Arthur
who, two months ago, had that freshness of feeling, that delicate



<p/>412

<p/>honour which shrinks from wounding even a sentiment, and does
not contemplate any more positive offence as possible for it?--who
thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own self-respect was a higher tribunal than any
external opinion? The same, I assure you, only under different
conditions. Our deeds determine us, as much as we determine our
deeds, and until we know what has been or will be the peculiar
combination of outward with inward facts, which constitutes a
man's critical actions, it will be better not to think ourselves wise
about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) character. There is a terrible coercion in our deeds,
which may first turn the honest man into a deceiver and then
reconcile him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the change, for this reason--that the second
wrong presents itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the guise of the only practicable
right. The action which before commission has been seen with
that blended common sense and fresh untarnished feeling which
is the healthy eye of the soul, is looked at afterwards with the lens
of apologetic ingenuity, through which all things that men call
beautiful and ugly are seen to be made up of textures very much
alike. Europe adjusts itself to a fait accompli, and so does an
individual character--until the placid adjustment is disturbed by a
convulsive retribution.
No man can escape this vitiating effect of an offence against his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
own sentiment of right, and the effect was the stronger in Arthur
because of that very need of self-respect which, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
conscience was still at ease, was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) best safeguards. Selfaccusation was too painful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could not face it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) must
persuade himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had not been very much to blame; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
began even to pity himself for the necessity he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was under of
deceiving Adam--it was a course so opposed to the honesty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
own nature. But then, it was the only right thing to do.



<p/>413

<p/>Well, whatever had been amiss in him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was miserable
enough in consequence: miserable about Hetty; miserable about
this letter that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had promised to write, and that seemed at one
moment to be a gross barbarity, at another perhaps the greatest
kindness he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could do to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). And across all this reflection would
dart every now and then a sudden impulse of passionate defiance
towards all consequences. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would carry Hetty away, and all
other considerations might go to ...
In this state of mind the four walls of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) room made an
intolerable prison to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>); they seemed to hem in and press down
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) all the crowd of contradictory thoughts and conflicting
feelings, some of which would fly away in the open air. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had
only an hour or two to make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mind in, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) must get clear
and calm. Once on Meg's back, in the fresh air of that fine
morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) should be more master of the situation.
The pretty creature arched her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) bay neck in the sunshine, and
pawed the gravel, and trembled with pleasure when her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) master
stroked her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) nose, and patted her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), and talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) even in a more
caressing tone than usual. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) the better because she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
knew nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) secrets. But Meg was quite as well acquainted
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) master's mental state as many others of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) sex with the
mental condition of the nice young gentlemen towards whom their
hearts are in a state of fluttering expectation.
Arthur cantered for five miles beyond the Chase, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was at
the foot of a hill where there were no hedges or trees to hem in the
road. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) threw the bridle on Meg's neck and prepared to
make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mind.
Hetty knew that their meeting yesterday must be the last before
Arthur went away--there was no possibility of their contriving



<p/>414

<p/>another without exciting suspicion--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was like a frightened
child, unable to think of anything, only able to cry at the mention
of parting, and then put her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) face up to have the tears kissed away.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could do nothing but comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), and lull her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) into dreaming
on. A letter would be a dreadfully abrupt way of awakening her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)!
Yet there was truth in what Adam said--that it would save her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
from a lengthened delusion, which might be worse than a sharp
immediate pain. And it was the only way of satisfying Adam, who
must be satisfied, for more reasons than one. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could have seen
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) again! But that was impossible; there was such a thorny hedge
of hindrances between them, and an imprudence would be fatal.
And yet, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) again, what good would it do? Only
cause him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to suffer more from the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) distress and the
remembrance of it. Away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was surrounded by all the
motives to self-control.
A sudden dread here fell like a shadow across his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) imagination--
the dread lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) should do something violent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) grief; and
close upon that dread came another, which deepened the shadow.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) shook them off with the force of youth and hope. What was
the ground for painting the future in that dark way? It was just as
likely to be the reverse. Arthur told himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) did not deserve that
things should turn out badly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had never meant beforehand to
do anything his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) conscience disapproved; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had been led on by
circumstances. There was a sort of implicit confidence in him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was really such a good fellow at bottom, Providence would not
treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) harshly.
At all events, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) couldn't help what would come now: all he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
could do was to take what seemed the best course at the present
moment. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) persuaded himself that that course was to make



<p/>415

<p/>the way open between Adam and Hetty. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heart might really
turn to Adam, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, after a while; and in that case there
would have been no great harm done, since it was still Adam's
ardent wish to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) wife. To be sure, Adam was
deceived--deceived in a way that Arthur would have resented as a
deep wrong if it had been practised on himself. That was a
reflection that marred the consoling prospect. Arthur's cheeks
even burned in mingled shame and irritation at the thought. But
what could a man do in such a dilemma? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was bound in honour
to say no word that could injure Hetty: his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first duty was to guard
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would never have told or acted a lie on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own account.
Good God! What a miserable fool he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was to have brought himself
into such a dilemma; and yet, if ever a man had excuses, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had.
-LRB-Pity that consequences are determined not by excuses but by
actions!-RRB-
Well, the letter must be written; it was the only means that
promised a solution of the difficulty. The tears came into Arthur's
eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) thought of Hetty reading it; but it would be almost as
hard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to write it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was not doing anything easy to himself;
and this last thought helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to arrive at a conclusion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
could never deliberately have taken a step which inflicted pain on
another and left himself at ease. Even a movement of jealousy at
the thought of giving up Hetty to Adam went to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was making a sacrifice.
When once he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had come to this conclusion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) turned Meg
round and set off home again in a canter. The letter should be
written the first thing, and the rest of the day would be filled up
with other business: he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) should have no time to look behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>).
Happily, Irwine and Gawaine were coming to dinner, and by



<p/>416

<p/>twelve o’clock the next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) should have left the Chase miles
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>). There was some security in this constant occupation
against an uncontrollable impulse seizing him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) to rush to Hetty and
thrust into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hand some mad proposition that would undo
everything. Faster and faster went the sensitive Meg, at every
slight sign from her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) rider, till the canter had passed into a swift
gallop.
<div class="bookquote">``I thought they said th' young mester war took ill last night,''
 (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>said sour old John, the groom, at dinner-time in the servants' hall.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)'s been ridin' fit to split the mare i' two this forenoon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's happen one o' the symptims, John,''  (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div>said the facetious
coachman.
<div class="bookquote">``Then I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) war let blood for 't, that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>said John,
grimly.
Adam had been early at the Chase to know how Arthur was,
and had been relieved from all anxiety about the effects of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
blow by learning that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was gone out for a ride. At five o’clock he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
was punctually there again, and sent up word of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) arrival. In a
few minutes Pym came down with a letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hand and gave it
to Adam, saying that the captain was too busy to see him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>), and had
written everything he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had to say. The letter was directed to Adam,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) went out of doors again before opening it. It contained a
sealed enclosure directed to Hetty. On the inside of the cover
Adam read:
``In the enclosed letter I have written everything you wish. I
leave it to you to decide whether you will be doing best to deliver it
to Hetty or to return it to me. Ask yourself once more whether you
are not taking a measure which may pain her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) more than mere



<p/>417

<p/>silence.
<div class="bookquote">``There is no need for our seeing each other again now. We shall
meet with better feelings some months hence.
A.D.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'s i' th' right on 't not to see me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>thought Adam.
<div class="bookquote">``It's no use meeting to say more hard words, and it's no use
meeting to shake hands and say we're friends again. We're not
friends, an' it's better not to pretend it. I know forgiveness is a
man's duty, but, to my thinking, that can only mean as you're to
give up all thoughts o' taking revenge: it can never mean as you're
t' have your old feelings back again, for that's not possible. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s
not the same man to me, and I can't feel the same towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
God help me! I don't know whether I feel the same towards
anybody: I seem as if I'd been measuring my work from a false
line, and had got it all to measure over again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>But the question about delivering the letter to Hetty soon
absorbed Adam's thoughts. Arthur had procured some relief to
himself by throwing the decision on Adam with a warning; and
Adam, who was not given to hesitation, hesitated here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
determined to feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) way--to ascertain as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could what
was Hetty's state of mind before he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) decided on delivering the
letter.




<p/>418

<p/>Chapter XXX
The Delivery of the Letter

<p/>T

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) next Sunday Adam joined the Poysers on their way out
of church, hoping for an invitation to go home with them.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had the letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) pocket, and was anxious to have an
opportunity of talking to Hetty alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) face at
church, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) seat, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
to shake hands, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) manner was doubtful and constrained. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
expected this, for it was the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had met him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) since she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
had been aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) with Arthur in the Grove.
<div class="bookquote">``Come, you'll go on with us, Adam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>Mr. Poyser said when they
reached the turning; and as soon as they were in the fields Adam
ventured to offer his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) arm to Hetty. The children soon gave them
an opportunity of lingering behind a little, and then Adam said:
<div class="bookquote">``Will you contrive for me to walk out in the garden a bit with
you this evening, if it keeps fine, Hetty? I've something partic'lar
to talk to you about.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Hetty said, <div class="bookquote">``Very well.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was really as anxious as Adam was
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) should have some private talk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) wondered
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and Arthur. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) must have seen them
kissing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knew, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had no conception of the scene that had
taken place between Arthur and Adam. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) first feeling had been
that Adam would be very angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), and perhaps would tell
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt and uncle, but it never entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would
dare to say anything to Captain Donnithorne. It was a relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) behaved so kindly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to-day, and wanted to speak to




<p/>419

<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) alone, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had trembled when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) found he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) was going
home with them lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) should mean <div class="bookquote">``to tell.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But, now he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) wanted
to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) by herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) should learn what he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) thought and
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) meant to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt a certain confidence that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could
persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) not to do anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) did not want him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) to do; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
could perhaps even make him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) didn't care for
Arthur; and as long as Adam thought there was any hope of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
having him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would do just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) liked, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knew. Besides,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) must go on seeming to encourage Adam, lest her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) uncle and
aunt should be angry and suspect her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) of having some secret lover.
Hetty's little brain was busy with this combination as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hung
on Adam's arm and said <div class="bookquote">``yes''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``no''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>to some slight observations
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) about the many hawthorn-berries there would be for the
birds this next winter, and the low-hanging clouds that would
hardly hold up till morning. And when they rejoined her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt and
uncle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could pursue her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thoughts without interruption, for Mr.
Poyser held that though a young man might like to have the
woman he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was courting on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would nevertheless be glad
of a little reasonable talk about business the while; and, for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
own part, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was curious to heal the most recent news about the
Chase Farm. So, through the rest of the walk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) claimed Adam's
conversation for himself, and Hetty laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) small plots and
imagined her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) little scenes of cunning blandishment, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) walked
along by the hedgerows on honest Adam's arm, quite as well as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had been an elegantly clad coquette alone in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) boudoir. For
if a country beauty in clumsy shoes be only shallow-hearted
enough, it is astonishing how closely her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mental processes may
resemble those of a lady in society and crinoline, who applies her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
refined intellect to the problem of committing indiscretions



<p/>420

<p/>without compromising herself. Perhaps the resemblance was not
much the less because Hetty felt very unhappy all the while. The
parting with Arthur was a double pain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)--mingling with the
tumult of passion and vanity there was a dim undefined fear that
the future might shape itself in some way quite unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) dream.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) clung to the comforting hopeful words Arthur had uttered in
their last meeting--<div class="bookquote">``I shall come again at Christmas, and then we
will see what can be done.''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) clung to the belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was so
fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would never be happy without her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) still
hugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) secret--that a great gentleman loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)--with
gratified pride, as a superiority over all the girls she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knew. But the
uncertainty of the future, the possibilities to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could give
no shape, began to press upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) like the invisible weight of air;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was alone on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) little island of dreams, and all around her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
was the dark unknown water where Arthur was gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could
gather no elation of spirits now by looking forward, but only by
looking backward to build confidence on past words and caresses.
But occasionally, since Thursday evening, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) dim anxieties had
been almost lost behind the more definite fear that Adam might
betray what he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) knew to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) uncle and aunt, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) sudden
proposition to talk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) alone had set her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thoughts to work in
a new way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was eager not to lose this evening's opportunity;
and after tea, when the boys were going into the garden and Totty
begged to go with them, Hetty said, with an alacrity that surprised
Mrs. Poyser,
<div class="bookquote">``I'll go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), Aunt.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>It did not seem at all surprising that Adam said he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would go too,
and soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) and Hetty were left alone together on the walk by the
filbert-trees, while the boys were busy elsewhere gathering the



<p/>421

<p/>large unripe nuts to play at <div class="bookquote">``cob-nut''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>with, and Totty was
watching them with a puppy-like air of contemplation. It was but a
short time--hardly two months--since Adam had had his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mind
filled with delicious hopes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) stood by Hetty's side in this
garden. The remembrance of that scene had often been with him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
since Thursday evening: the sunlight through the apple-tree
boughs, the red bunches, Hetty's sweet blush. It came
importunately now, on this sad evening, with the low-hanging
clouds, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) tried to suppress it, lest some emotion should impel
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to say more than was needful for Hetty's sake.
<div class="bookquote">``After what I saw on Thursday night, Hetty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``you
won't think me making too free in what I'm going to say. If you
was being courted by any man as 'ud make you his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, and I'd
known you was fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and meant to have him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I should have
no right to speak a word to you about it; but when I see you're
being made love to by a gentleman as can never marry you, and
doesna think o' marrying you, I feel bound t' interfere for you. I
can't speak about it to them as are i' the place o' your parents, for
that might bring worse trouble than's needful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Adam's words relieved one of Hetty's fears, but they also
carried a meaning which sickened her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) with a strengthened
foreboding. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was pale and trembling, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would have
angrily contradicted Adam, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had dared to betray her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) feelings.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was silent.
<div class="bookquote">``You're so young, you know, Hetty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) went on, almost
tenderly, ``and y' haven't seen much o' what goes on in the world.
It's right for me to do what I can to save you from getting into
trouble for want o' your knowing where you're being led to. If
anybody besides me knew what I know about your meeting a



<p/>422

<p/>gentleman and having fine presents from him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), they'd speak light
on you, and you'd lose your character. And besides that, you'll
have to suffer in your feelings, wi' giving your love to a man as can
never marry you, so as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might take care of you all your life.''
Adam paused and looked at Hetty, who was plucking the leaves
from the filbert-trees and tearing them up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hand. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) little
plans and preconcerted speeches had all forsaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), like an illlearnt lesson, under the terrible agitation produced by Adam's
words. There was a cruel force in their calm certainty which
threatened to grapple and crush her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) flimsy hopes and fancies. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
wanted to resist them--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) wanted to throw them off with angry
contradiction--but the determination to conceal what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt still
governed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). It was nothing more than a blind prompting now,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was unable to calculate the effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) words.
``You've no right to say as I love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said, faintly, but
impetuously, plucking another rough leaf and tearing it up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
was very beautiful in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) paleness and agitation, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) dark
childish eyes dilated and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) breath shorter than usual. Adam's
heart yearned over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). Ah, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could but
comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), and soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), and save her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) from this pain; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had
but some sort of strength that would enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to rescue her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
poor troubled mind, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would have rescued her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) body in the face
of all danger!
``I doubt it must be so, Hetty,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, tenderly; ``for I canna
believe you'd let any man kiss you by yourselves, and give you a
gold box with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair, and go a-walking i' the Grove to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
if you didna love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I'm not blaming you, for I know it 'ud begin
by little and little, till at last you'd not be able to throw it off. It's
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) I blame for stealing your love i' that way, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)



<p/>423

<p/>could never make you the right amends. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s been trifling with
you, and making a plaything of you, and caring nothing about you
as a man ought to care.''
``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does care for me; I know better nor you,'' Hetty burst
out. Everything was forgotten but the pain and anger she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt at
Adam's words.
``Nay, Hetty,'' said Adam, ``if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d cared for you rightly, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d
never ha' behaved so. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told me himself he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meant nothing by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
kissing and presents, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted to make me believe as you
thought light of ’em too. But I know better nor that. I can't help
thinking as you've been trusting to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loving you well enough to
marry you, for all he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a gentleman. And that's why I must speak to
you about it, Hetty, for fear you should be deceiving yourself. It's
never entered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head the thought o' marrying you.''
``How do you know? How durst you say so?'' said Hetty,
pausing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) walk and trembling. The terrible decision of
Adam's tone shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) with fear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had no presence of mind left
for the reflection that Arthur would have his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) reasons for not telling
the truth to Adam. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) words and look were enough to determine
Adam: he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) must give her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) the letter.
<div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you can't believe me, Hetty, because you think too
well of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--because you think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loves you better than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does.
But I've got a letter i' my pocket, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrote himself for me to give
you. I've not read the letter, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s told you the truth in
it. But before I give you the letter, consider, Hetty, and don't let it
take too much hold on you. It wouldna ha' been good for you if
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d wanted to do such a mad thing as marry you: it 'ud ha' led to
no happiness i' th' end.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hetty said nothing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt a revival of hope at the mention of a



<p/>424

<p/>letter which Adam had not read. There would be something quite
different in it from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought.
Adam took out the letter, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) held it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hand still, while
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, in a tone of tender entreaty, <div class="bookquote">``Don't you bear me ill will,
Hetty, because I'm the means o' bringing you this pain. God knows
I'd ha' borne a good deal worse for the sake o' sparing it you. And
think--there's nobody but me knows about this, and I'll take care
of you as if I was your brother. You're the same as ever to me, for I
don't believe you've done any wrong knowingly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Hetty had laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hand on the letter, but Adam did not loose it
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had done speaking. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) took no notice of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
had not listened; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) loosed the letter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) put it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
pocket, without opening it, and then began to walk more quickly,
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) wanted to go in.
<div class="bookquote">``You're in the right not to read it just yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam. <div class="bookquote">``Read it
when you're by yourself. But stay out a little bit longer, and let us
call the children: you look so white and ill, your aunt may take
notice of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>Hetty heard the warning. It recalled to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) the necessity of
rallying her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) native powers of concealment, which had half given
way under the shock of Adam's words. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had the letter in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) pocket: she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was sure there was comfort in that letter in spite of
Adam. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) ran to find Totty, and soon reappeared with recovered
colour, leading Totty, who was making a sour face because she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
had been obliged to throw away an unripe apple that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had set
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) small teeth in.
<div class="bookquote">``Hegh, Totty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, <div class="bookquote">``come and ride on my shoulder--
ever so high--you'll touch the tops o' the trees.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>What little child ever refused to be comforted by that glorious



<p/>425

<p/>sense of being seized strongly and swung upward? I don't believe
Ganymede cried when the eagle carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) away, and perhaps
deposited him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) on Jove's shoulder at the end. Totty smiled down
complacently from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) secure height, and pleasant was the sight
to the mother's eyes, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) stood at the house door and saw Adam
coming with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) small burden.
<div class="bookquote">``Bless your sweet face, my pet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said, the mother's strong
love filling her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) keen eyes with mildness, as Totty leaned forward
and put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) arms. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had no eyes for Hetty at that moment,
and only said, without looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``You go and draw some ale,
Hetty; the gells are both at the cheese.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>After the ale had been drawn and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) uncle's pipe lighted, there
was Totty to be taken to bed, and brought down again in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
night-gown because she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would cry instead of going to sleep. Then
there was supper to be got ready, and Hetty must be continually in
the way to give help. Adam stayed till he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) knew Mrs. Poyser
expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to go, engaging her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) husband in talk as
constantly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could, for the sake of leaving Hetty more at ease.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) lingered, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) wanted to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) safely through that
evening, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was delighted to find how much self-command
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) showed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had not had time to read the letter, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) did not know she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was buoyed up by a secret hope that the letter
would contradict everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had said. It was hard work for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)--hard to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) should not know for days how
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was bearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) trouble. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) must go at last, and all he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
could do was to press her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hand gently as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and
hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would take that as a sign that if his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) love could ever be a
refuge for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), it was there the same as ever. How busy his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
thoughts were, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) walked home, in devising pitying excuses for



<p/>426

<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) folly, in referring all her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) weakness to the sweet lovingness of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) nature, in blaming Arthur, with less and less inclination to
admit that his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) conduct might be extenuated too! His (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) exasperation
at Hetty's suffering--and also at the sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was possibly
thrust for ever out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own reach--deafened him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to any plea for
the miscalled friend who had wrought this misery. Adam was a
clear-sighted, fair-minded man--a fine fellow, indeed, morally as
well as physically. But if Aristides the Just was ever in love and
jealous, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was at that moment not perfectly magnanimous. And I
cannot pretend that Adam, in these painful days, felt nothing but
righteous indignation and loving pity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was bitterly jealous, and
in proportion as his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) love made him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) indulgent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) judgment of
Hetty, the bitterness found a vent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) feeling towards Arthur.
<div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) head was allays likely to be turned,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``when a
gentleman, with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) fine manners, and fine clothes, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) white
hands, and that way o' talking gentlefolks have, came about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>),
making up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) in a bold way, as a man couldn't do that was only
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) equal; and it's much if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'ll ever like a common man now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could not help drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) own hands out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) pocket and
looking at them--at the hard palms and the broken finger-nails.
``I'm a roughish fellow, altogether; I don't know, now I come to
think on 't, what there is much for a woman to like about me; and
yet I might ha' got another wife easy enough, if I hadn't set my
heart on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). But it's little matter what other women think about
me, if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) can't love me. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might ha' loved me, perhaps, as likely
as any other man--there's nobody hereabouts as I'm afraid of, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
hadn't come between us; but now I shall belike be hateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
because I'm so different to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). And yet there's no telling--she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
may turn round the other way, when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) finds he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s made light of



<p/>427

<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) all the while. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) may come to feel the vally of a man as 'ud be
thankful to be bound to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life. But I must put up with it
whichever way it is--I've only to be thankful it's been no worse. I
am not th' only man that's got to do without much happiness i' this
life. There's many a good bit o' work done with a bad heart. It's
God's will, and that's enough for us: we shouldn't know better how
things ought to be than He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) does, I reckon, if we was to spend our
lives i' puzzling. But it 'ud ha' gone near to spoil my work for me, if
I'd seen her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) brought to sorrow and shame, and through the man
as I've always been proud to think on. Since I've been spared that,
I've no right to grumble. When a man's got his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) limbs whole, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can
bear a smart cut or two.''
As Adam was getting over a stile at this point in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) reflections,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) perceived a man walking along the field before him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) knew it
was Seth, returning from an evening preaching, and made haste to
overtake him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>).
``I thought thee 'dst be at home before me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, as Seth
turned round to wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>), ``for I'm later than usual to-night.''
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm later too, for I got into talk, after meeting, with John
Barnes, who has lately professed himself in a state of perfection,
and I'd a question to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Barnes</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Barnes</b></font>) experience. It's one o' them
subjects that lead you further than y' expect--they don't lie along
the straight road.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They walked along together in silence two or three minutes.
Adam was not inclined to enter into the subtleties of religious
experience, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was inclined to interchange a word or two of
brotherly affection and confidence with Seth. That was a rare
impulse in him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>), much as the brothers loved each other. They
hardly ever spoke of personal matters, or uttered more than an



<p/>428

<p/>allusion to their family troubles. Adam was by nature reserved in
all matters of feeling, and Seth felt a certain timidity towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)
more practical brother.
<div class="bookquote">``Seth, lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam said, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) arm on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) brother's
shoulder, <div class="bookquote">``hast heard anything from Dinah Morris since she (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) went

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Seth. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) told me I might write her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) word after a
while, how we went on, and how mother bore up under her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
trouble. So I wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a fortnight ago, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) about thee
having a new employment, and how Mother was more contented;
and last Wednesday, when I called at the post at Treddles'on, I
found a letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). I think thee 'dst perhaps like to read it, but
I didna say anything about it because thee 'dst seemed so full of
other things. It's quite easy t' read--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) writes wonderful for a
woman.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>Seth had drawn the letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) pocket and held it out to
Adam, who said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) took it, <div class="bookquote">``Aye, lad, I've got a tough load to
carry just now--thee mustna take it ill if I'm a bit silenter and
crustier nor usual. Trouble doesna make me care the less for thee.
I know we shall stick together to the last.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I take nought ill o' thee, Adam. I know well enough what it

Adam, as they mounted the slope. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s been sitting i' the dark as
usual. Well, Gyp, well, art glad to see me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>Lisbeth went in again quickly and lighted a candle, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) had
heard the welcome rustling of footsteps on the grass, before Gyp's
joyful bark.
``Eh, my lads! Th' hours war ne’er so long sin' I war born as



<p/>429

<p/>they’n been this blessed Sunday night. What can ye both ha' been
doin' till this time?''
``Thee shouldstna sit i' the dark, Mother,'' said Adam; ``that
makes the time seem longer.''
``Eh, what am I to do wi' burnin' candle of a Sunday, when
there's on'y me an' it's sin to do a bit o' knittin'? The daylight's
long enough for me to stare i' the booke as I canna read. It 'ud be a
fine way o' shortenin' the time, to make it waste the good candle.
But which on you's for ha’in' supper? Ye mun ayther be clemmed
or full, I should think, seein' what time o' night it is.''
``I'm hungry, Mother,'' said Seth, seating himself at the little
table, which had been spread ever since it was light.
``I've had my supper,'' said Adam. ``Here, Gyp,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) added,
taking some cold potato from the table and rubbing the rough grey
head that looked up towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>).
``Thee needstna be gi’in' th' dog,'' said Lisbeth; ``I’n fed him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)

``Come, then, Gyp,'' said Adam, ``we'll go to bed. Good-night,
Mother; I'm very tired.''
``What ails him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), dost know?'' Lisbeth said to Seth, when Adam
was gone upstairs. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'s like as if he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was struck for death this day

 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam, meanwhile, was reading Dinah's letter by the light of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
dip candle.
DEAR BROTHER SETH--Your letter lay three days beyond my
knowing of it at the post, for I had not money enough by me to pay
the carriage, this being a time of great need and sickness here,
with the rains that have fallen, as if the windows of heaven were
opened again; and to lay by money, from day to day, in such a
time, when there are so many in present need of all things, would
be a want of trust like the laying up of the manna. I speak of this,
because I would not have you think me slow to answer, or that I
had small joy in your rejoicing at the worldly good that has
befallen your brother Adam. The honour and love you bear him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) is
nothing but meet, for God has given him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) great gifts, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) uses
them as the patriarch Joseph did, who, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) was exalted to a
place of power and trust, yet yearned with tenderness towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
parent and his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) younger brother.
``My heart is knit to your aged mother since it was granted me
to be near her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in the day of trouble. Speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) of me, and tell
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) I often bear her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in my thoughts at evening time, when I am
sitting in the dim light as I did with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and we held one another's
hands, and I spoke the words of comfort that were given to me.
Ah, that is a blessed time, isn't it, Seth, when the outward light is
fading, and the body is a little wearied with its work and its labour.
Then the inward light shines the brighter, and we have a deeper
sense of resting on the Divine strength. I sit on my chair in the
dark room and close my eyes, and it is as if I was out of the body



<p/>431

<p/>and could feel no want for evermore. For then, the very hardship,
and the sorrow, and the blindness, and the sin I have beheld and
been ready to weep over--yea, all the anguish of the children of
men, which sometimes wraps me round like sudden darkness--I
can bear with a willing pain, as if I was sharing the Redeemer's
cross. For I feel it, I feel it--infinite love is suffering too--yea, in
the fulness of knowledge it suffers, it yearns, it mourns; and that is
a blind self-seeking which wants to be freed from the sorrow
wherewith the whole creation groaneth and travaileth. Surely it is
not true blessedness to be free from sorrow, while there is sorrow
and sin in the world: sorrow is then a part of love, and love does
not seek to throw it off. It is not the spirit only that tells me this--I
see it in the whole work and word of the Gospel. Is there not
pleading in heaven? Is not the Man of Sorrows there in that
crucified body wherewith he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) ascended? And is He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) not one with
the Infinite Love itself--as our love is one with our sorrow?
``These thoughts have been much borne in on me of late, and I
have seen with new clearness the meaning of those words, `If any
man love me, let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) take up my cross.' I have heard this enlarged
on as if it meant the troubles and persecutions we bring on
ourselves by confessing Jesus. But surely that is a narrow thought.
The true cross of the Redeemer was the sin and sorrow of this
world--that was what lay heavy on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) heart--and that is the cross
we shall share with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>), that is the cup we must drink of with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>),
if we would have any part in that Divine Love which is one with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) sorrow.
``In my outward lot, which you ask about, I have all things and
abound. I have had constant work in the mill, though some of the
other hands have been turned off for a time, and my body is



<p/>432

<p/>greatly strengthened, so that I feel little weariness after long
walking and speaking. What you say about staying in your own
country with your mother and brother shows me that you have a
true guidance; your lot is appointed there by a clear showing, and
to seek a greater blessing elsewhere would be like laying a false
offering on the altar and expecting the fire from heaven to kindle
it. My work and my joy are here among the hills, and I sometimes
think I cling too much to my life among the people here, and
should be rebellious if I was called away.
``I was thankful for your tidings about the dear friends at the
Hall Farm, for though I sent them a letter, by my aunt's desire,
after I came back from my sojourn among them, I have had no
word from them. My aunt has not the pen of a ready writer, and
the work of the house is sufficient for the day, for she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is weak in
body. My heart cleaves to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) children as the nearest of all
to me in the flesh--yea, and to all in that house. I am carried away
to them continually in my sleep, and often in the midst of work,
and even of speech, the thought of them is borne in on me as if
they were in need and trouble, which yet is dark to me. There may
be some leading here; but I wait to be taught. You say they are all
well.
``We shall see each other again in the body, I trust, though, it
may be, not for a long while; for the brethren and sisters at Leeds
are desirous to have me for a short space among them, when I
have a door opened me again to leave Snowfield.
``Farewell, dear brother--and yet not farewell. For those
children of God whom it has been granted to see each other face to
face, and to hold communion together, and to feel the same spirit
working in both can never more be sundered though the hills may



<p/>433

<p/>lie between. For their souls are enlarged for evermore by that
union, and they bear one another about in their thoughts
continually as it were a new strength.--Your faithful Sister and
fellow-worker in Christ,
DINAH MORRIS.''
``I have not skill to write the words so small as you do and my
pen moves slow. And so I am straitened, and say but little of what
is in my mind. Greet your mother for me with a kiss. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asked me
to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) twice when we parted.''
Adam had refolded the letter, and was sitting meditatively with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) head resting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) arm at the head of the bed, when Seth
came upstairs.
``Hast read the letter?'' said Seth.
``Yes,'' said Adam. ``I don't know what I should ha' thought of
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) letter if I'd never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>): I daresay I should ha'
thought a preaching woman hateful. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s one as makes
everything seem right she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says and does, and I seemed to see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
and hear her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) speaking when I read the letter. It's wonderful how I
remember her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looks and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d make thee rare and
happy, Seth; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s just the woman for thee.''
``It's no use thinking o' that,'' said Seth, despondingly. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
spoke so firm, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s not the woman to say one thing and mean
another.''
``Nay, but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feelings may grow different. A woman may get to
love by degrees--the best fire dosna flare up the soonest. I'd have
thee go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) by-and-by: I'd make it convenient for thee to
be away three or four days, and it 'ud be no walk for thee--only



<p/>434

<p/>between twenty and thirty mile.''
``I should like to see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) again, whether or no, if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wouldna be
displeased with me for going,'' said Seth.
``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll be none displeased,'' said Adam emphatically, getting up
and throwing off his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) coat. ``It might be a great happiness to us all if
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d have thee, for mother took to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) so wonderful and seemed
so contented to be with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''
``Aye,'' said Seth, rather timidly, ``and Dinah's fond o' Hetty too;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thinks a deal about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>).''
Adam made no reply to that, and no other word but <div class="bookquote">``goodnight''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>passed between them.




<p/>435

<p/>Chapter XXXI
In Hetty's Bed-Chamber

<p/>I

<p/>T was no longer light enough to go to bed without a candle,
even in Mrs. Poyser's early household, and Hetty carried one
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) went up at last to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) bedroom soon after
Adam was gone, and bolted the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>).
Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would read her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) letter. It must--it must have comfort in
it. How was Adam to know the truth? It was always likely he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
should say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) did say.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) set down the candle and took out the letter. It had a faint
scent of roses, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) feel as if Arthur were close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) put it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) lips, and a rush of remembered sensations for a
moment or two swept away all fear. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heart began to flutter
strangely, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hands to tremble as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) broke the seal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
read slowly; it was not easy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to read a gentleman's
handwriting, though Arthur had taken pains to write plainly.
``DEAREST HETTY--I have spoken truly when I have said that I
loved you, and I shall never forget our love. I shall be your true
friend as long as life lasts, and I hope to prove this to you in many
ways. If I say anything to pain you in this letter, do not believe it is
for want of love and tenderness towards you, for there is nothing I
would not do for you, if I knew it to be really for your happiness. I
cannot bear to think of my little Hetty shedding tears when I am
not there to kiss them away; and if I followed only my own
inclinations, I should be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) at this moment instead of




<p/>436

<p/>writing. It is very hard for me to part from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)--harder still for me
to write words which may seem unkind, though they spring from
the truest kindness.
``Dear, dear Hetty, sweet as our love has been to me, sweet as it
would be to me for you to love me always, I feel that it would have
been better for us both if we had never had that happiness, and
that it is my duty to ask you to love me and care for me as little as
you can. The fault has all been mine, for though I have been
unable to resist the longing to be near you, I have felt all the while
that your affection for me might cause you grief. I ought to have
resisted my feelings. I should have done so, if I had been a better
fellow than I am; but now, since the past cannot be altered, I am
bound to save you from any evil that I have power to prevent. And
I feel it would be a great evil for you if your affections continued so
fixed on me that you could think of no other man who might be
able to make you happier by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love than I ever can, and if you
continued to look towards something in the future which cannot
possibly happen. For, dear Hetty, if I were to do what you one day
spoke of, and make you my wife, I should do what you yourself
would come to feel was for your misery instead of your welfare. I
know you can never be happy except by marrying a man in your
own station; and if I were to marry you now, I should only be
adding to any wrong I have done, besides offending against my
duty in the other relations of life. You know nothing, dear Hetty, of
the world in which I must always live, and you would soon begin
to dislike me, because there would be so little in which we should
be alike.
``And since I cannot marry you, we must part--we must try not
to feel like lovers any more. I am miserable while I say this, but



<p/>437

<p/>nothing else can be. Be angry with me, my sweet one, I deserve it;
but do not believe that I shall not always care for you--always be
grateful to you--always remember my Hetty; and if any trouble
should come that we do not now foresee, trust in me to do
everything that lies in my power.
``I have told you where you are to direct a letter to, if you want
to write, but I put it down below lest you should have forgotten. Do
not write unless there is something I can really do for you; for,
dear Hetty, we must try to think of each other as little as we can.
Forgive me, and try to forget everything about me, except that I
shall be, as long as I live, your affectionate friend,
ARTHUR DONNITHORNE.
Slowly Hetty had read this letter; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) looked up from
it there was the reflection of a blanched face in the old dim glass--
a white marble face with rounded childish forms, but with
something sadder than a child's pain in it. Hetty did not see the
face--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) saw nothing--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) only felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was cold and sick
and trembling. The letter shook and rustled in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) laid
it down. It was a horrible sensation--this cold and trembling. It
swept away the very ideas that produced it, and Hetty got up to
reach a warm cloak from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) clothes-press, wrapped it round her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>),
and sat as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) were thinking of nothing but getting warm.
Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) took up the letter with a firmer hand, and began to
read it through again. The tears came this time--great rushing
tears that blinded her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and blotched the paper. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt nothing but
that Arthur was cruel--cruel to write so, cruel not to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>).
Reasons why he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could not marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had no existence for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
mind; how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) believe in any misery that could come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)



<p/>438

<p/>from the fulfilment of all she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had been longing for and dreaming
of? She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had not the ideas that could make up the notion of that
misery.
As she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) threw down the letter again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) caught sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) face
in the glass; it was reddened now, and wet with tears; it was
almost like a companion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) might complain to--that would
pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) leaned forward on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) elbows, and looked into those
dark overflooding eyes and at the quivering mouth, and saw how
the tears came thicker and thicker, and how the mouth became
convulsed with sobs.
The shattering of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) little dream-world, the crushing blow
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) new-born passion, afflicted her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) pleasure-craving nature
with an overpowering pain that annihilated all impulse to
resistance, and suspended her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) anger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) sat sobbing till the
candle went out, and then, wearied, aching, stupefied with crying,
threw herself on the bed without undressing and went to sleep.
There was a feeble dawn in the room when Hetty awoke, a little
after four o’clock, with a sense of dull misery, the cause of which
broke upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) gradually as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) began to discern the objects
round her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) in the dim light. And then came the frightening thought
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had to conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) misery as well as to bear it, in this
dreary daylight that was coming. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could lie no longer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) got
up and went towards the table: there lay the letter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) opened
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) treasure-drawer: there lay the ear-rings and the locket--the
signs of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) short happiness--the signs of the lifelong
dreariness that was to follow it. Looking at the little trinkets which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had once eyed and fingered so fondly as the earnest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
future paradise of finery, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) lived back in the moments when they
had been given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) with such tender caresses, such strangely



<p/>439

<p/>pretty words, such glowing looks, which filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) with a
bewildering delicious surprise--they were so much sweeter than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had thought anything could be. And the Arthur who had
spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) in this way, who was present with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) now--whose arm she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt round her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) cheek against hers,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) very breath upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)--was the cruel, cruel Arthur who had
written that letter, that letter which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) snatched and crushed and
then opened again, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) might read it once more. The halfbenumbed mental condition which was the effect of the last
night's violent crying made it necessary to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to look again and
see if her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) wretched thoughts were actually true--if the letter was
really so cruel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had to hold it close to the window, else she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
could not have read it by the faint light. Yes! It was worse--it was
more cruel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) crushed it up again in anger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hated the writer
of that letter--hated him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) for the very reason that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hung upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) love--all the girlish passion and vanity that made
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) love.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had no tears this morning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had wept them all away last
night, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt that dry-eyed morning misery, which is
worse than the first shock because it has the future in it as well as
the present. Every morning to come, as far as her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) imagination
could stretch, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would have to get up and feel that the day would
have no joy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). For there is no despair so absolute as that
which comes with the first moments of our first great sorrow,
when we have not yet known what it is to have suffered and be
healed, to have despaired and to have recovered hope. As Hetty
began languidly to take off the clothes she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had worn all the night,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) might wash herself and brush her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hair, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had a
sickening sense that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) life would go on in this way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) should



<p/>440

<p/>always be doing things she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had no pleasure in, getting up to the
old tasks of work, seeing people she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cared nothing about, going to
church, and to Treddleston, and to tea with Mrs. Best, and
carrying no happy thought with her (<font color='blue'><b>Best</b></font>). For her (<font color='blue'><b>Best</b></font>) short poisonous
delights had spoiled for ever all the little joys that had once made
the sweetness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Best</b></font>) life--the new frock ready for Treddleston
Fair, the party at Mr. Britton's at Broxton wake, the beaux that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Best</b></font>) would say <div class="bookquote">``No''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>to for a long while, and the prospect of the
wedding that was to come at last when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would have a silk gown
and a great many clothes all at once. These things were all flat and
dreary to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) now; everything would be a weariness, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
would carry about for ever a hopeless thirst and longing.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) paused in the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) languid undressing and leaned
against the dark old clothes-press. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) neck and arms were bare,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hair hung down in delicate rings--and they were just as
beautiful as they were that night two months ago, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
walked up and down this bed-chamber glowing with vanity and
hope. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was not thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) neck and arms now; even her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
own beauty was indifferent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eyes wandered sadly over
the dull old chamber, and then looked out vacantly towards the
growing dawn. Did a remembrance of Dinah come across her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
mind? Of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) foreboding words, which had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) angry? Of
Dinah's affectionate entreaty to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) as a friend in trouble?
No, the impression had been too slight to recur. Any affection or
comfort Dinah could have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would have been as
indifferent to Hetty this morning as everything else was except her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
bruised passion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was only thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) could never stay here
and go on with the old life--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) could better bear something quite
new than sinking back into the old everyday round. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would like



<p/>441

<p/>to run away that very morning, and never see any of the old faces
again. But Hetty's was not a nature to face difficulties--to dare to
loose her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hold on the familiar and rush blindly on some unknown
condition. Hers was a luxurious and vain nature--not a passionate
one--and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) were ever to take any violent measure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) must
be urged to it by the desperation of terror. There was not much
room for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thoughts to travel in the narrow circle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
imagination, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) soon fixed on the one thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would do to
get away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) old life: she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) uncle to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) go to
be a lady's maid. Miss Lydia's maid would help her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) to get a
situation, if she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) krew Hetty had her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) uncle's leave.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had thought of this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) fastened up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hair and
began to wash: it seemed more possible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to go downstairs
and try to behave as usual. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) uncle this very day.
On Hetty's blooming health it would take a great deal of such
mental suffering as hers to leave any deep impress; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
was dressed as neatly as usual in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) working-dress, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hair
tucked up under her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) little cap, an indifferent observer would have
been more struck with the young roundness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cheek and neck
and the darkness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eyes and eyelashes than with any signs of
sadness about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) took up the crushed letter and
put it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) drawer, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) might lock it out of sight, hard
smarting tears, having no relief in them as the great drops had
that fell last night, forced their way into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) wiped them
away quickly: she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) must not cry in the day-time. Nobody should
find out how miserable she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was, nobody should know she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was
disappointed about anything; and the thought that the eyes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
aunt and uncle would be upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) the self-command
which often accompanies a great dread. For Hetty looked out from



<p/>442

<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) secret misery towards the possibility of their ever knowing
what had happened, as the sick and weary prisoner might think of
the possible pillory. They would think her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) conduct shameful, and
shame was torture. That was poor little Hetty's conscience.
So she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) locked up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) drawer and went away to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) early work.
In the evening, when Mr. Poyser was smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) pipe, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
good-nature was therefore at its superlative moment, Hetty seized
the opportunity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt's absence to say, <div class="bookquote">``Uncle, I wish you'd
let me go for a lady's maid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>Mr. Poyser took the pipe from his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) mouth and looked at Hetty in
mild surprise for some moments. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was sewing, and went on
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) work industriously.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, what's put that into your head, my wench?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) said at
last, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) had given one conservative puff.
<div class="bookquote">``I should like it--I should like it better than farm-work.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay; you fancy so because you donna know it, my wench.
It wouldn't be half so good for your health, nor for your luck i' life.
I'd like you to stay wi' us till you've got a good husband: you're my
own niece, and I wouldn't have you go to service, though it was a
gentleman's house, as long as I've got a home for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>Mr. Poyser paused, and puffed away at his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) pipe.
<div class="bookquote">``I like the needlework,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>said Hetty, <div class="bookquote">``and I should get good
wages.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Has your aunt been a bit sharp wi' you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser, not
noticing Hetty's further argument. <div class="bookquote">``You mustna mind that, my
wench--she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) does it for your good. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) wishes you well; an' there
isn't many aunts as are no kin to you 'ud ha' done by you as she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
has.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, it isn't my aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>said Hetty, ``but I should like the work



<p/>443

<p/>better.''
``It was all very well for you to learn the work a bit--an' I gev
my consent to that fast enough, sin' Mrs. Pomfret was willing to
teach you. For if anything was t' happen, it's well to know how to
turn your hand to different sorts o' things. But I niver meant you
to go to service, my wench; my family's ate their own bread and
cheese as fur back as anybody knows, hanna they, Father? You
wouldna like your grand-child to take wage?''
``Na-a-y,'' said old Martin, with an elongation of the word,
meant to make it bitter as well as negative, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) leaned
forward and looked down on the floor. ``But the wench takes arter
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>) mother. I'd hard work t' hould her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>) in, an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>) married i' spite o'
me--a feller wi' on'y two head o' stock when there should ha' been
ten on's farm--she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>) might well die o' th' inflammation afore she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>)
war thirty.''
It was seldom the old man made so long a speech, but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son's
question had fallen like a bit of dry fuel on the embers of a long
unextinguished resentment, which had always made the
grandfather more indifferent to Hetty than to his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) son's children.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mother's fortune had been spent by that good-for-nought
Sorrel, and Hetty had Sorrel's blood in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) veins.
``Poor thing, poor thing!'' said Martin the younger, who was
sorry to have provoked this retrospective harshness. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfret</b></font>)'d but
bad luck. But Hetty's got as good a chance o' getting a solid, sober
husband as any gell i' this country.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>After throwing out this pregnant hint, Mr. Poyser recurred to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) pipe and his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) silence, looking at Hetty to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) did not give
some sign of having renounced her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) ill-advised wish. But instead of
that, Hetty, in spite of herself, began to cry, half out of ill temper at



<p/>444

<p/>the denial, half out of the day's repressed sadness.
<div class="bookquote">``Hegh, hegh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser, meaning to check her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) playfully,
<div class="bookquote">``don't let's have any crying. Crying's for them as ha' got no home,
not for them as want to get rid o' one. What dost think?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
continued to his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) wife, who now came back into the house-place,
knitting with fierce rapidity, as if that movement were a necessary
function, like the twittering of a crab's antennae.
<div class="bookquote">``Think? Why, I think we shall have the fowl stole before we are
much older, wi' that gell forgetting to lock the pens up o' nights.
What's the matter now, Hetty? What are you crying at?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s been wanting to go for a lady's maid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr.

wi' her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mouth buttoned up so all day. It's all wi' going so among
them servants at the Chase, as we war fools for letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)

thinks there's nothing belongs to being a lady's maid but wearing
finer clothes nor she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was born to, I'll be bound. It's what rag she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
can get to stick on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s thinking on from morning till night,
as I often ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) wouldn't like to be the mawkin i' the field,
for then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'d be made o' rags inside and out. I'll never gi' my

them valets, as is neither a common man nor a gentleman, an'
must live on the fat o' the land, an 's like enough to stick his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands
under his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) coat-tails and expect his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wife to work for him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser, ``we must have a better husband
for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nor that, and there's better at hand. Come, my wench, give



<p/>445

<p/>over crying and get to bed. I'll do better for you nor letting you go
for a lady's maid. Let's hear no more on't.''
When Hetty was gone upstairs he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) said, ``I canna make it out as
she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) should want to go away, for I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)'d got a mind t' Adam
Bede. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)'s looked like it o' late.''
``Eh, there's no knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)'s got a liking to, for things
take no more hold on her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) than if she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was a dried pea. I believe that
gell, Molly--as is aggravatin' enough, for the matter o' that--but I
believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'d care more about leaving us and the children, for all
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'s been here but a year come Michaelmas, nor Hetty would.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s got this notion o' being a lady's maid wi' going among
them servants--we might ha' known what it 'ud lead to when we
let her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) go to learn the fine work. But I'll put a stop to it pretty
quick.''
``Thee 'dst be sorry to part wi' her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), if it wasn't for her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) good,''
said Mr. Poyser. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)'s useful to thee i' the work.''
``Sorry? Yes, I'm fonder on her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) nor she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) deserves--a little hardhearted hussy, wanting to leave us i' that way. I can't ha' had her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
about me these seven year, I reckon, and done for her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), and taught
her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) everything wi’out caring about her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>). An' here I'm having linen
spun, an' thinking all the while it'll make sheeting and tableclothing for her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)'s married, an' she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)'ll live i' the parish wi'
us, and never go out of our sights--like a fool as I am for thinking
aught about her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), as is no better nor a cherry wi' a hard stone
inside it.''
``Nay, nay, thee mustna make much of a trifle,'' said Mr. Poyser,
soothingly. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)'s fond on us, I'll be bound; but she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)'s young, an'

young fillies 'ull run away often wi'-out knowing why.''



 (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>446

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) uncle's answers, however, had had another effect on Hetty
besides that of disappointing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and making her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knew
quite well whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) mind in his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) allusions to marriage,
and to a sober, solid husband; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) bedroom
again, the possibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) marrying Adam presented itself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
in a new light. In a mind where no strong sympathies are at work,
where there is no supreme sense of right to which the agitated
nature can cling and steady itself to quiet endurance, one of the
first results of sorrow is a desperate vague clutching after any
deed that will change the actual condition. Poor Hetty's vision of
consequences, at no time more than a narrow fantastic calculation
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) own probable pleasures and pains, was now quite shut out
by reckless irritation under present suffering, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was ready
for one of those convulsive, motiveless actions by which wretched
men and women leap from a temporary sorrow into a lifelong
misery.
Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) not marry Adam? She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) did not care what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
did, so that it made some change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt confident that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would still want to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), and any further thought about
Adam's happiness in the matter had never yet visited her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Strange!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>perhaps you will say, <div class="bookquote">``this rush of impulse to-wards
a course that might have seemed the most repugnant to her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
present state of mind, and in only the second night of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
sadness!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>Yes, the actions of a little trivial soul like Hetty's, struggling
amidst the serious sad destinies of a human being, are strange. So
are the motions of a little vessel without ballast tossed about on a
stormy sea. How pretty it looked with its parti-coloured sail in the
sunlight, moored in the quiet bay!



<p/>447

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let that man bear the loss who loosed it from its moorings.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But that will not save the vessel--the pretty thing that might
have been a lasting joy.




<p/>448

<p/>Chapter XXXII
Mrs. Poyser <div class="bookquote">``Has Her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) Say Out''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div><p/>T

<p/>HE (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) next Saturday evening there was much excited
discussion at the Donnithorne Arms concerning an
incident which had occurred that very day--no less than a
second appearance of the smart man in top-boots said by some to
be a mere farmer in treaty for the Chase Farm, by others to be the
future steward, but by Mr. Casson himself, the personal witness to
the stranger's visit, pronounced contemptuously to be nothing
better than a bailiff, such as Satchell had been before him (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>). No one
had thought of denying Mr. Casson's testimony to the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>)
had seen the stranger; nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) proffered various
corroborating circumstances.
<div class="bookquote">``I see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>) said; ``I see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coming along by the
Crab-tree Meadow on a bald-faced hoss. I'd just been t' hev a
pint--it was half after ten i' the fore-noon, when I hev my pint as
reg'lar as the clock--and I says to Knowles, as druv up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Knowles</b></font>)
waggon, `You'll get a bit o' barley to-day, Knowles,' I says, `if you
look about you'; and then I went round by the rick-yard, and
towart the Treddles'on road, and just as I come up by the big ashtree, I see the man i' top-boots coming along on a bald-faced
hoss--I wish I may never stir if I didn't. And I stood still till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
come up, and I says, `Good morning, sir,' I says, for I wanted to
hear the turn of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tongue, as I might know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a
this-country man; so I says, `Good morning, sir: it 'll 'old hup for
the barley this morning, I think. There'll be a bit got hin, if we've




<p/>449

<p/>good luck.' And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says, `Eh, ye may be raight, there's noo tallin','
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says, and I knowed by that''--here Mr. Casson gave a wink--
``as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't come from a hundred mile off. I daresay he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d think
me a hodd talker, as you Loamshire folks allays does hany one as
talks the right language.''
``The right language!'' said Bartle Massey, contemptuously.
``You're about as near the right language as a pig's squeaking is
like a tune played on a key-bugle.''
``Well, I don't know,'' answered Mr. Casson, with an angry
smile. ``I should think a man as has lived among the gentry from a
by, is likely to know what's the right language pretty nigh as well
as a schoolmaster.''
``Aye, aye, man,'' said Bartle, with a tone of sarcastic
consolation, ``you talk the right language for you. When Mike
Holdsworth's goat says ba-a-a, it's all right--it 'ud be unnatural for
it to make any other noise.''
The rest of the party being Loamshire men, Mr. Casson had the
laugh strongly against him (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>), and wisely fell back on the previous
question, which, far from being exhausted in a single evening, was
renewed in the churchyard, before service, the next day, with the
fresh interest conferred on all news when there is a fresh person
to hear it; and that fresh hearer was Martin Poyser, who, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
wife said, <div class="bookquote">``never went boozin' with that set at Casson's, a-sittin'
soakin' in drink, and looking as wise as a lot o' cod-fish wi' red
faces.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was probably owing to the conversation she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had had with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
husband on their way from church concerning this problematic
stranger that Mrs. Poyser's thoughts immediately reverted to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)



<p/>450

<p/>door with her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) knitting, in that eager leisure which came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
when the afternoon cleaning was done, she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) saw the old squire
enter the yard on his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) black pony, followed by John the groom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
always cited it afterwards as a case of prevision, which really had
something more in it than her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) own remarkable penetration, that
the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) set eyes on the squire she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) said to herself, <div class="bookquote">``I
shouldna wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>Casson</b></font>)'s come about that man as is a-going to take
the Chase Farm, wanting Poyser to do something for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) without
pay. But Poyser's a fool if he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) does.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Something unwonted must clearly be in the wind, for the old
squire's visits to his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) tenantry were rare; and though Mrs. Poyser
had during the last twelvemonth recited many imaginary
speeches, meaning even more than met the ear, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was
quite determined to make to him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) the next time he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) appeared within
the gates of the Hall Farm, the speeches had always remained
imaginary.
<div class="bookquote">``Good-day, Mrs. Poyser,''  (<font color='red'><b>the squire mode</b></font>)</div>said the old squire, peering at her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
with his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) short-sighted eyes--a mode of looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) which, as
Mrs. Poyser observed, <div class="bookquote">``allays aggravated me: it was as if you was a
insect, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was going to dab his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) finger-nail on you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Your servant, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and curtsied with an air
of perfect deference as she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) advanced towards him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was not the
woman to misbehave towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) betters, and fly in the face of the
catechism, without severe provocation.
<div class="bookquote">``Is your husband at home, Mrs. Poyser?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s only i' the rick-yard. I'll send for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in a minute,
if you'll please to get down and step in.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Thank you; I will do so. I want to consult him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) about a little
matter; but you are quite as much concerned in it, if not more. I



<p/>451

<p/>must have your opinion too.''
``Hetty, run and tell your uncle to come in,'' said Mrs. Poyser, as
they entered the house, and the old gentleman bowed low in
answer to Hetty's curtsy; while Totty, conscious of a pinafore
stained with gooseberry jam, stood hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) face against the
clock and peeping round furtively.
``What a fine old kitchen this is!'' said Mr. Donnithorne, looking
round admiringly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) always spoke in the same deliberate, wellchiselled, polite way, whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) words were sugary or venomous.
``And you keep it so exquisitely clean, Mrs. Poyser. I like these
premises, do you know, beyond any on the estate.''
``Well, sir, since you're fond of ’em, I should be glad if you'd let a
bit o' repairs be done to ’em, for the boarding's i' that state as
we're like to be eaten up wi' rats and mice; and the cellar, you may
stan' up to your knees i' water in't, if you like to go down; but
perhaps you'd rather believe my words. Won't you please to sit
down, sir?''
``Not yet; I must see your dairy. I have not seen it for years, and
I hear on all hands about your fine cheese and butter,'' said the
squire, looking politely unconscious that there could be any
question on which he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) and Mrs. Poyser might happen to disagree.
``I think I see the door open, there. You must not be surprised if I
cast a covetous eye on your cream and butter. I don't expect that
Mrs. Satchell's cream and butter will bear comparison with
yours.''
``I can't say, sir, I'm sure. It's seldom I see other folks's butter,
though there's some on it as one's no need to see--the smell's
enough.''
<div class="bookquote">``Ah, now this I like,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Donnithorne, looking round at



<p/>452

<p/>the damp temple of cleanliness, but keeping near the door. <div class="bookquote">``I'm
sure I should like my breakfast better if I knew the butter and
cream came from this dairy. Thank you, that really is a pleasant
sight. Unfortunately, my slight tendency to rheumatism makes me
afraid of damp: I'll sit down in your comfortable kitchen. Ah,
Poyser, how do you do? In the midst of business, I see, as usual.
I've been looking at your wife's beautiful dairy--the best manager
in the parish, is she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>Mr. Poyser had just entered in shirt-sleeves and open waistcoat,
with a face a shade redder than usual, from the exertion of
<div class="bookquote">``pitching.''  (<font color='red'><b>shirt-sleeves waistcoat</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) stood, red, rotund, and radiant, before the small,
wiry, cool old gentleman, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) looked like a prize apple by the side of
a withered crab.
<div class="bookquote">``Will you please to take this chair, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
father's arm-chair forward a little: <div class="bookquote">``you'll find it easy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you, I never sit in easy-chairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old
gentleman, seating himself on a small chair near the door. <div class="bookquote">``Do you
know, Mrs. Poyser--sit down, pray, both of you--I've been far
from contented, for some time, with Mrs. Satchell's dairy
management. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Satchell</b></font>) has not a good method, as you have.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, sir, I can't speak to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser in a hard
voice, rolling and unrolling her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) knitting and looking icily out of the
window, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) continued to stand opposite the squire. Poyser
might sit down if he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) liked, she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) thought; she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) wasn't going to sit
down, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)'d give in to any such smooth-tongued palaver. Mr.
Poyser, who looked and felt the reverse of icy, did sit down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
three-cornered chair.
``And now, Poyser, as Satchell is laid up, I am intending to let
the Chase Farm to a respectable tenant. I'm tired of having a farm



<p/>453

<p/>on my own hands--nothing is made the best of in such cases, as
you know. A satisfactory bailiff is hard to find; and I think you and
I, Poyser, and your excellent wife here, can enter into a little
arrangement in consequence, which will be to our mutual
advantage.''
``Oh,'' said Mr. Poyser, with a good-natured blankness of
imagination as to the nature of the arrangement.
``If I'm called upon to speak, sir,'' said Mrs. Poyser, after
glancing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) husband with pity at his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) softness, ``you know better
than me; but I don't see what the Chase Farm is t' us--we've
cumber enough wi' our own farm. Not but what I'm glad to hear o'
anybody respectable coming into the parish; there's some as ha'
been brought in as hasn't been looked on i' that character.''
``You're likely to find Mr. Thurle an excellent neighbour, I
assure you--such a one as you will feel glad to have
accommodated by the little plan I'm going to mention, especially
as I hope you will find it as much to your own advantage as his (<font color='blue'><b>Thurle</b></font>).''
``Indeed, sir, if it's anything t' our advantage, it'll be the first
offer o' the sort I've heared on. It's them as take advantage that get
advantage i' this world, I think. Folks have to wait long enough
afore it's brought to ’em.''
``The fact is, Poyser,'' said the squire, ignoring Mrs. Poyser's
theory of worldly prosperity, ``there is too much dairy land, and
too little plough land, on the Chase Farm to suit Thurle's
purpose--indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) will only take the farm on condition of some
change in it: his (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) wife, it appears, is not a clever dairy-woman, like
yours. Now, the plan I'm thinking of is to effect a little exchange. If
you were to have the Hollow Pastures, you might increase your
dairy, which must be so profitable under your wife's management;



<p/>454

<p/>and I should request you, Mrs. Poyser, to supply my house with
milk, cream, and butter at the market prices. On the other hand,
Poyser, you might let Thurle have the Lower and Upper Ridges,
which really, with our wet seasons, would be a good riddance for
you. There is much less risk in dairy land than corn land.''
Mr. Poyser was leaning forward, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) elbows on his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) knees,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) head on one side, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) mouth screwed up--apparently
absorbed in making the tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) fingers meet so as to represent
with perfect accuracy the ribs of a ship. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was much too acute a
man not to see through the whole business, and to foresee
perfectly what would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) wife's view of the subject; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
disliked giving unpleasant answers. Unless it was on a point of
farming practice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) would rather give up than have a quarrel, any
day; and, after all, it mattered more to his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) wife than to him (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>). So,
after a few moments' silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and said mildly,
``What dost say?''
Mrs. Poyser had had her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) eyes fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) husband with cold
severity during his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) silence, but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) head
with a toss, looked icily at the opposite roof of the cow-shed, and
spearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) knitting together with the loose pin, held it firmly
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) clasped hands.
``Say? Why, I say you may do as you like about giving up any o'
your corn land afore your lease is up, which it won't be for a year
come next Michaelmas, but I'll not consent to take more dairy
work into my hands, either for love or money; and there's nayther
love nor money here, as I can see, on'y other folks's love o'
theirselves, and the money as is to go into other folks's pockets. I
know there's them as is born t' own the land, and them as is born
to sweat on't''--here Mrs. Poyser paused to gasp a little--``and I



<p/>455

<p/>know it's christened folks's duty to submit to their betters as fur as
flesh and blood 'ull bear it; but I'll not make a martyr o' myself,
and wear myself to skin and bone, and worret myself as if I was a
churn wi' butter a-coming in't, for no landlord in England, not if
he (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) was King George himself.''
``No, no, my dear Mrs. Poyser, certainly not,'' said the squire,
still confident in his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) own powers of persuasion, ``you must not
overwork yourself; but don't you think your work will rather be
lessened than increased in this way? There is so much milk
required at the Abbey that you will have little increase of cheese
and butter making from the addition to your dairy; and I believe
selling the milk is the most profitable way of disposing of dairy
produce, is it not?''
``Aye, that's true,'' said Mr. Poyser, unable to repress an opinion
on a question of farming profits, and forgetting that it was not in
this case a purely abstract question.
``I daresay,'' said Mrs. Poyser bitterly, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) head halfway towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) husband and looking at the vacant arm-chair--``I
daresay it's true for men as sit i' th' chimney-corner and make
believe as everything's cut wi' ins an' outs to fit int' everything
else. If you could make a pudding wi' thinking o' the batter, it 'ud
be easy getting dinner. How do I know whether the milk 'ull be
wanted constant? What's to make me sure as the house won't be
put o' board wage afore we're many months older, and then I may
have to lie awake o' nights wi' twenty gallons o' milk on my
mind--and Dingall 'ull take no more butter, let alone paying for it;
and we must fat pigs till we're obliged to beg the butcher on our
knees to buy ’em, and lose half of ’em wi' the measles. And there's
the fetching and carrying, as 'ud be welly half a day's work for a



<p/>456

<p/>man an' hoss--that's to be took out o' the profits, I reckon? But
there's folks 'ud hold a sieve under the pump and expect to carry
away the water.''
``That difficulty--about the fetching and carrying--you will not
have, Mrs. Poyser,'' said the squire, who thought that this entrance
into particulars indicated a distant inclination to compromise on
Mrs. Poyser's part. ``Bethell will do that regularly with the cart and
pony.''
``Oh, sir, begging your pardon, I've never been used t' having
gentlefolks's servants coming about my back places, a-making love
to both the gells at once and keeping ’em with their hands on their
hips listening to all manner o' gossip when they should be down
on their knees a-scouring. If we're to go to ruin, it shanna be wi'
having our back kitchen turned into a public.''
``Well, Poyser,'' said the squire, shifting his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) tactics and looking
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) thought Mrs. Poyser had suddenly withdrawn from the
proceedings and left the room, <div class="bookquote">``you can turn the Hollows into
feeding-land. I can easily make another arrangement about
supplying my house. And I shall not forget your readiness to
accommodate your landlord as well as a neighbour. I know you
will be glad to have your lease renewed for three years, when the
present one expires; otherwise, I daresay Thurle, who is a man of
some capital, would be glad to take both the farms, as they could
be worked so well together. But I don't want to part with an old
tenant like you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>To be thrust out of the discussion in this way would have been
enough to complete Mrs. Poyser's exasperation, even without the
final threat. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) husband, really alarmed at the possibility of their
leaving the old place where he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been bred and born--for he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)



<p/>457

<p/>believed the old squire had small spite enough for anything--was
beginning a mild remonstrance explanatory of the inconvenience
he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) should find in having to buy and sell more stock, with,
<div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, I think as it's rether hard ...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>when Mrs. Poyser
burst in with the desperate determination to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) say out this
once, though it were to rain notices to quit and the only shelter
were the workhouse.
<div class="bookquote">``Then, sir, if I may speak--as, for all I'm a woman, and there's
folks as thinks a woman's fool enough to stan' by an' look on while
the men sign her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soul away, I've a right to speak, for I make one
quarter o' the rent, and save another quarter--I say, if Mr.
Thurle's so ready to take farms under you, it's a pity but what he (<font color='blue'><b>Thurle</b></font>)
should take this, and see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Thurle</b></font>) likes to live in a house wi' all the
plagues o' Egypt in't--wi' the cellar full o' water, and frogs and
toads hoppin' up the steps by dozens--and the floors rotten, and
the rats and mice gnawing every bit o' cheese, and runnin' over
our heads as we lie i' bed till we expect ’em to eat us up alive--as
it's a mercy they hanna eat the children long ago. I should like to
see if there's another tenant besides Poyser as 'ud put up wi' never
having a bit o' repairs done till a place tumbles down--and not
then, on'y wi' begging and praying and having to pay half--and
being strung up wi' the rent as it's much if he (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) gets enough out o'
the land to pay, for all he (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>)'s put his (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) own money into the ground
beforehand. See if you'll get a stranger to lead such a life here as
that: a maggot must be born i' the rotten cheese to like it, I reckon.
You may run away from my words, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Poyser,
following the old squire beyond the door--for after the first
moments of stunned surprise he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) had got up, and, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) hand
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) with a smile, had walked out towards his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) pony. But it



<p/>458

<p/>was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) to get away immediately, for John was
walking the pony up and down the yard, and was some distance
from the causeway when his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) master beckoned.
<div class="bookquote">``You may run away from my words, sir, and you may go
spinnin' underhand ways o' doing us a mischief, for you've got Old
Harry to your friend, though nobody else is, but I tell you for once
as we're not dumb creatures to be abused and made money on by
them as ha' got the lash i' their hands, for want o' knowing how t'
undo the tackle. An' if I'm th' only one as speaks my mind, there's
plenty o' the same way o' thinking i' this parish and the next to 't,
for your name's no better than a brimstone match in everybody's
nose--if it isna two-three old folks as you think o' saving your soul
by giving ’em a bit o' flannel and a drop o' porridge. An' you may
be right i' thinking it'll take but little to save your soul, for it'll be
the smallest savin' y' iver made, wi' all your scrapin'.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a waggoner</b></font>)</div>There are occasions on which two servant-girls and a waggoner
may be a formidable audience, and as the squire rode away on his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>)
black pony, even the gift of short-sightedness did not prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>)
from being aware that Molly and Nancy and Tim were grinning
not far from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>). Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) suspected that sour old John was
grinning behind him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)--which was also the fact. Meanwhile the
bull-dog, the black-and-tan terrier, Alick's sheep-dog, and the
gander hissing at a safe distance from the pony's heels carried out
the idea of Mrs. Poyser's solo in an impressive quartet.
Mrs. Poyser, however, had no sooner seen the pony move off
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) turned round, gave the two hilarious damsels a look
which drove them into the back kitchen, and unspearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
knitting, began to knit again with her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) usual rapidity as she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) reentered the house.



<p/>459

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thee'st done it now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser, a little alarmed and
uneasy, but not without some triumphant amusement at his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) wife's
outbreak.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know I've done it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser; <div class="bookquote">``but I've had my
say out, and I shall be th' easier for 't all my life. There's no
pleasure i' living if you're to be corked up for ever, and only
dribble your mind out by the sly, like a leaky barrel. I shan't
repent saying what I think, if I live to be as old as th' old squire;
and there's little likelihood--for it seems as if them as aren't
wanted here are th' only folks as aren't wanted i' th' other world.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But thee wutna like moving from th' old place, this
Michaelmas twelvemonth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser, <div class="bookquote">``and going into a
strange parish, where thee know'st nobody. It'll be hard upon us
both, and upo' Father too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Eh, it's no use worreting; there's plenty o' things may happen
between this and Michaelmas twelvemonth. The captain may be
master afore them, for what we know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser, inclined
to take an unusually hopeful view of an embarrassment which had
been brought about by her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) own merit and not by other people's
fault.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm none for worreting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser, rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) threecornered chair and walking slowly towards the door; <div class="bookquote">``but I should
be loath to leave th' old place, and the parish where I was bred and
born, and Father afore me. We should leave our roots behind us, I
doubt, and niver thrive again.''

<p/>T

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) barley was all carried at last, and the harvest suppers
went by without waiting for the dismal black crop of
beans. The apples and nuts were gathered and stored; the
scent of whey departed from the farm-houses, and the scent of
brewing came in its stead. The woods behind the Chase, and all
the hedgerow trees, took on a solemn splendour under the dark
low-hanging skies. Michaelmas was come, with its fragrant
basketfuls of purple damsons, and its paler purple daisies, and its
lads and lasses leaving or seeking service and winding along
between the yellow hedges, with their bundles under their arms.
But though Michaelmas was come, Mr. Thurle, that desirable
tenant, did not come to the Chase Farm, and the old squire, after
all, had been obliged to put in a new bailiff. It was known
throughout the two parishes that the squire's plan had been
frustrated because the Poysers had refused to be <div class="bookquote">``put upon,''  (<font color='red'><b>the squire</b></font>)</div>and
Mrs. Poyser's outbreak was discussed in all the farm-houses with a
zest which was only heightened by frequent repetition. The news
that <div class="bookquote">``Bony''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>was come back from Egypt was comparatively insipid,
and the repulse of the French in Italy was nothing to Mrs. Poyser's
repulse of the old squire. Mr. Irwine had heard a version of it in
every parishioner's house, with the one exception of the Chase.
But since he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) had always, with marvellous skill, avoided any
quarrel with Mr. Donnithorne, he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) could not allow himself the
pleasure of laughing at the old gentleman's discomfiture with any




<p/>461

<p/>one besides his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) mother, who declared that if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were rich she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
should like to allow Mrs. Poyser a pension for life, and wanted to
invite her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) to the parsonage that she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) might hear an account of the
scene from Mrs. Poyser's own lips.
<div class="bookquote">``No, no, Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Irwine; <div class="bookquote">``it was a little bit of irregular
justice on Mrs. Poyser's part, but a magistrate like me must not
countenance irregular justice. There must be no report spread
that I have taken notice of the quarrel, else I shall lose the little
good influence I have over the old man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I like that woman even better than her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cream-cheeses,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Irwine</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Irwine. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has the spirit of three men, with that pale
face of hers. And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says such sharp things too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sharp! Yes, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tongue is like a new-set razor. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s quite
original in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) talk too; one of those untaught wits that help to
stock a country with proverbs. I told you that capital thing I heard
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) say about Craig--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) was like a cock, who thought the sun
had risen to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) crow. Now that's an Æsop's fable in a
sentence.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But it will be a bad business if the old gentleman turns them
out of the farm next Michaelmas, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Irwine</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Irwine.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, that must not be; and Poyser is such a good tenant that
Donnithorne is likely to think twice, and digest his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spleen rather
than turn them out. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) should give them notice at Lady Day,
Arthur and I must move heaven and earth to mollify him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). Such old
parishioners as they are must not go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, there's no knowing what may happen before Lady day,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Irwine</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Irwine. ``It struck me on Arthur's birthday that the old
man was a little shaken: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s eighty-three, you know. It's really an
unconscionable age. It's only women who have a right to live as



<p/>462

<p/>long as that.''
``When they've got old-bachelor sons who would be forlorn
without them,'' said Mr. Irwine, laughing, and kissing his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) mother's
hand.
Mrs. Poyser, too, met her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) husband's occasional forebodings of a
notice to quit with ``There's no knowing what may happen before
Lady Day''--one of those undeniable general propositions which
are usually intended to convey a particular meaning very far from
undeniable. But it is really too hard upon human nature that it
should be held a criminal offence to imagine the death even of the
king when he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is turned eighty-three. It is not to be believed that
any but the dullest Britons can be good subjects under that hard
condition.
Apart from this foreboding, things went on much as usual in the
Poyser household. Mrs. Poyser thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) noticed a surprising
improvement in Hetty. To be sure, the girl got <div class="bookquote">``closer tempered,
and sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) seemed as if there'd be no drawing a word
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) with cart-ropes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thought much less about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
dress, and went after the work quite eagerly, without any telling.
And it was wonderful how she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) never wanted to go out now--
indeed, could hardly be persuaded to go; and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bore her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) aunt's
putting a stop to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) weekly lesson in fine-work at the Chase
without the least grumbling or pouting. It must be, after all, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had set her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart on Adam at last, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sudden freak of
wanting to be a lady's maid must have been caused by some little
pique or misunderstanding between them, which had passed by.
For whenever Adam came to the Hall Farm, Hetty seemed to be in
better spirits and to talk more than at other times, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was
almost sullen when Mr. Craig or any other admirer happened to



<p/>463

<p/>pay a visit there.
Adam himself watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) at first with trembling anxiety,
which gave way to surprise and delicious hope. Five days after
delivering Arthur's letter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had ventured to go to the Hall Farm
again--not without dread lest the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) might be painful to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was not in the house-place when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) entered, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sat
talking to Mr. and Mrs. Poyser for a few minutes with a heavy fear
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) heart that they might presently tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) Hetty was ill. But
by-and-by there came a light step that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knew, and when Mrs.
Poyser said, <div class="bookquote">``Come, Hetty, where have you been?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>Adam was
obliged to turn round, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was afraid to see the changed
look there must be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) almost started when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
smiling as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) were pleased to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)--looking the same as
ever at a first glance, only that she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) cap on, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had
never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) in before when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) came of an evening. Still, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) again and again as she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) moved about or sat at her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
work, there was a change: the cheeks were as pink as ever, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) smiled as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) had ever done of late, but there was
something different in her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) eyes, in the expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) face, in all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) movements, Adam thought--something harder, older, less
child-like. <div class="bookquote">``Poor thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``that's allays likely. It's
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s had her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) first heartache. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s got a spirit to bear
up under it. Thank God for that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As the weeks went by, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) always looking pleased to
see him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)--turning up her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) lovely face towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) meant
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to understand that she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was glad for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to come--and going
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) work in the same equable way, making no sign of
sorrow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) began to believe that her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) feeling towards Arthur must
have been much slighter than he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had imagined in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) first



<p/>464

<p/>indignation and alarm, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) had been able to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
girlish fancy that Arthur was in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) and would marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
as a folly of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was timely cured. And it perhaps was, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
had sometimes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) more cheerful moments hoped it would be--
her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) heart was really turning with all the more warmth towards the
man she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) knew to have a serious love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>).
Possibly you think that Adam was not at all sagacious in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
interpretations, and that it was altogether extremely unbecoming
in a sensible man to behave as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did--falling in love with a girl
who really had nothing more than her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) beauty to recommend her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),
attributing imaginary virtues to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and even condescending to
cleave to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) after she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had fallen in love with another man, waiting
for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kind looks as a patient trembling dog waits for his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) master's
eye to be turned upon him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>). But in so complex a thing as human
nature, we must consider, it is hard to find rules without
exceptions. Of course, I know that, as a rule, sensible men fall in
love with the most sensible women of their acquaintance, see
through all the pretty deceits of coquettish beauty, never imagine
themselves loved when they are not loved, cease loving on all
proper occasions, and marry the woman most fitted for them in
every respect--indeed, so as to compel the approbation of all the
maiden ladies in their neighbourhood. But even to this rule an
exception will occur now and then in the lapse of centuries, and
my friend Adam was one. For my own part, however, I respect him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
none the less--nay, I think the deep love he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had for that sweet,
rounded, blossom-like, dark-eyed Hetty, of whose inward self he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
was really very ignorant, came out of the very strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
nature and not out of any inconsistent weakness. Is it any
weakness, pray, to be wrought on by exquisite music? To feel its



<p/>465

<p/>wondrous harmonies searching the subtlest windings of your soul,
the delicate fibres of life where no memory can penetrate, and
binding together your whole being past and present in one
unspeakable vibration, melting you in one moment with all the
tenderness, all the love that has been scattered through the
toilsome years, concentrating in one emotion of heroic courage or
resignation all the hard-learnt lessons of self-renouncing
sympathy, blending your present joy with past sorrow and your
present sorrow with all your past joy? If not, then neither is it a
weakness to be so wrought upon by the exquisite curves of a
woman's cheek and neck and arms, by the liquid depths of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
beseeching eyes, or the sweet childish pout of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips. For the
beauty of a lovely woman is like music: what can one say more?
Beauty has an expression beyond and far above the one woman's
soul that it clothes, as the words of genius have a wider meaning
than the thought that prompted them. It is more than a woman's
love that moves us in a woman's eyes--it seems to be a far-off
mighty love that has come near to us, and made speech for itself
there; the rounded neck, the dimpled arm, move us by something
more than their prettiness--by their close kinship with all we have
known of tenderness and peace. The noblest nature sees the most
of this impersonal expression in beauty -LRB-it is needless to say that
there are gentlemen with whiskers dyed and undyed who see none
of it whatever-RRB-, and for this reason, the noblest nature is often the
most blinded to the character of the one woman's soul that the
beauty clothes. Whence, I fear, the tragedy of human life is likely
to continue for a long time to come, in spite of mental philosophers
who are ready with the best receipts for avoiding all mistakes of
the kind.

<p/>Our good Adam had no fine words into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could put his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
feeling for Hetty: he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could not disguise mystery in this way with
the appearance of knowledge; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) called his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) love frankly a mystery,
as you have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) only knew that the sight and memory
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) moved him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) deeply, touching the spring of all love and
tenderness, all faith and courage within him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
imagine narrowness, selfishness, hardness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) created the
mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) believed in out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) own, which was large, unselfish,
tender.
The hopes he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) felt about Hetty softened a little his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) feeling
towards Arthur. Surely his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) attentions to Hetty must have been of a
slight kind; they were altogether wrong, and such as no man in
Arthur's position ought to have allowed himself, but they must
have had an air of playfulness about them, which had probably
blinded him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to their danger and had prevented them from laying
any strong hold on Hetty's heart. As the new promise of happiness
rose for Adam, his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) indignation and jealousy began to die out. Hetty
was not made unhappy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) almost believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
best; and the thought sometimes crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mind that the
friendship which had once seemed dead for ever might revive in
the days to come, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would not have to say <div class="bookquote">``good-bye''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to the
grand old woods, but would like them better because they were
Arthur's. For this new promise of happiness following so quickly
on the shock of pain had an intoxicating effect on the sober Adam,
who had all his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) life been used to much hardship and moderate
hope. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) really going to have an easy lot after all? It seemed
so, for at the beginning of November, Jonathan Burge, finding it
impossible to replace Adam, had at last made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mind to offer
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) a share in the business, without further condition than that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)



<p/>467

<p/>should continue to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) energies to it and renounce all thought
of having a separate business of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) own. Son-in-law or no son-inlaw, Adam had made himself too necessary to be parted with, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) headwork was so much more important to Burge than his (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) skill
in handicraft that his (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) having the management of the woods made
little difference in the value of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) services; and as to the bargains
about the squire's timber, it would be easy to call in a third person.
Adam saw here an opening into a broadening path of prosperous
work such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had thought of with ambitious longing ever since
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was a lad: he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) might come to build a bridge, or a town hall, or a
factory, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had always said to himself that Jonathan Burge's
building business was like an acorn, which might be the mother of
a great tree. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) hand to Burge on that bargain, and
went home with his (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) mind full of happy visions, in which -LRB-my
refined reader will perhaps be shocked when I say it-RRB- the image of
Hetty hovered, and smiled over plans for seasoning timber at a
trifling expense, calculations as to the cheapening of bricks per
thousand by water-carriage, and a favourite scheme for the
strengthening of roofs and walls with a peculiar form of iron
girder. What then? Adam's enthusiasm lay in these things; and
our love is inwrought in our enthusiasm as electricity is inwrought
in the air, exalting its power by a subtle presence.
Adam would be able to take a separate house now, and provide
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother in the old one; his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) prospects would justify his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
marrying very soon, and if Dinah consented to have Seth, their
mother would perhaps be more contented to live apart from
Adam. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) told himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would not be hasty--he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would
not try Hetty's feeling for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) until it had had time to grow strong
and firm. However, tomorrow, after church, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would go to the



<p/>468

<p/>Hall Farm and tell them the news. Mr. Poyser, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) knew, would like
it better than a five-pound note, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) should see if Hetty's eyes
brightened at it. The months would be short with all he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) had to fill
his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) mind, and this foolish eagerness which had come over him (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) of
late must not hurry him (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) into any premature words. Yet when he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
got home and told his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) mother the good news, and ate his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) supper,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sat by almost crying for joy and wanting him (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) to eat twice
as much as usual because of this good-luck, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) could not help
preparing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gently for the coming change by talking of the old
house being too small for them all to go on living in it always.




<p/>469

<p/>Chapter XXXIV
The Betrothal

<p/>I

<p/>t was a dry Sunday, and really a pleasant day for the 2d of
November. There was no sunshine, but the clouds were high,
and the wind was so still that the yellow leaves which
fluttered down from the hedgerow elms must have fallen from
pure decay. Nevertheless, Mrs. Poyser did not go to church, for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) had taken a cold too serious to be neglected; only two winters
ago she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) had been laid up for weeks with a cold; and since his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wife
did not go to church, Mr. Poyser considered that on the whole it
would be as well for him (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) to stay away too and <div class="bookquote">``keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
company.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) could perhaps have given no precise form to the
reasons that determined this conclusion, but it is well known to all
experienced minds that our firmest convictions are often
dependent on subtle impressions for which words are quite too
coarse a medium. However it was, no one from the Poyser family
went to church that afternoon except Hetty and the boys; yet
Adam was bold enough to join them after church, and say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
would walk home with them, though all the way through the
village he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) appeared to be chiefly occupied with Marty and Tommy,
telling them about the squirrels in Binton Coppice, and promising
to take them there some day. But when they came to the fields he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>)
said to the boys, <div class="bookquote">``Now, then, which is the stoutest walker? Him (<font color='blue'><b>walker</b></font>) as
gets to th' home-gate first shall be the first to go with me to Binton
Coppice on the donkey. But Tommy must have the start up to the
next stile, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>)'s the smallest.''




 (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div><p/>470

<p/>Adam had never behaved so much like a determined lover
before. As soon as the boys had both set off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) looked down at
Hetty and said, <div class="bookquote">``Won't you hang on my arm, Hetty?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>in a pleading
tone, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had already asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had refused. Hetty
looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) smilingly and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) round arm through his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) in a
moment. It was nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) arm through Adam's,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) cared a great deal about having her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) arm through
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to care. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heart beat no faster, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
looked at the half-bare hedgerows and the ploughed field with the
same sense of oppressive dulness as before. But Adam scarcely felt
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was walking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought Hetty must know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was
pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) arm a little--a very little. Words rushed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) lips
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) dared not utter--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mind not to utter
yet--and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was silent for the length of that field. The calm
patience with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had once waited for Hetty's love, content
only with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) presence and the thought of the future, had forsaken
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) since that terrible shock nearly three months ago. The
agitations of jealousy had given a new restlessness to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) passion--
had made fear and uncertainty too hard almost to bear. But
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) might not speak to Hetty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) love, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) new prospects and see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would be pleased. So when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was enough master of himself to talk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to tell
your uncle some news that'll surprise him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), Hetty; and I think he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)'ll
be glad to hear it too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>Hetty said indifferently.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, Mr. Burge has offered me a share in his (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) business, and
I'm going to take it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>There was a change in Hetty's face, certainly not produced by
any agreeable impression from this news. In fact she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt a



<p/>471

<p/>momentary annoyance and alarm, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had so often heard it
hinted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) uncle that Adam might have Mary Burge and a
share in the business any day, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) liked, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) associated the
two objects now, and the thought immediately occurred that
perhaps Adam had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) up because of what had happened
lately, and had turned towards Mary Burge. With that thought,
and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had time to remember any reasons why it could not
be true, came a new sense of forsakenness and disappointment.
The one thing--the one person--her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mind had rested on in its dull
weariness, had slipped away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), and peevish misery filled
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eyes with tears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was looking on the ground, but Adam saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) face, saw the tears, and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had finished saying, <div class="bookquote">``Hetty,
dear Hetty, what are you crying for?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) eager rapid thought had
flown through all the causes conceivable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), and had at last
alighted on half the true one. Hetty thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was going to marry
Mary Burge--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) didn't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to marry--perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) didn't
like him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to marry any one but herself? All caution was swept
away--all reason for it was gone, and Adam could feel nothing but
trembling joy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) leaned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hand, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
said:
<div class="bookquote">``I could afford to be married now, Hetty--I could make a wife
comfortable; but I shall never want to be married if you won't have
me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Hetty looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) and smiled through her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) tears, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
had done to Arthur that first evening in the wood, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was not coming, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) came. It was a feebler
relief, a feebler triumph she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt now, but the great dark eyes and
the sweet lips were as beautiful as ever, perhaps more beautiful,
for there was a more luxuriant womanliness about Hetty of late.



<p/>472

<p/>Adam could hardly believe in the happiness of that moment. His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
right hand held her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) left, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) arm close against his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
heart as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) leaned down towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Do you really love me, Hetty? Will you be my own wife, to love
and take care of as long as I live?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>Hetty did not speak, but Adam's face was very close to hers, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) put up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) round cheek against his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), like a kitten. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) wanted
to be caressed--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) wanted to feel as if Arthur were with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
again.
Adam cared for no words after that, and they hardly spoke
through the rest of the walk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) only said, <div class="bookquote">``I may tell your uncle
and aunt, mayn't I, Hetty?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The red fire-light on the hearth at the Hall Farm shone on
joyful faces that evening, when Hetty was gone upstairs and Adam
took the opportunity of telling Mr. and Mrs. Poyser and the
grandfather that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) way to maintaining a wife now, and
that Hetty had consented to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I hope you have no objections against me for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) husband,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam; <div class="bookquote">``I'm a poor man as yet, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) shall want nothing as I
can work for.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Objections?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser, while the grandfather leaned
forward and brought out his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) long <div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay.''  (<font color='red'><b>the grandfather</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What objections
can we ha' to you, lad? Never mind your being poorish as yet;
there's money in your head-piece as there's money i' the sown
field, but it must ha' time. You've got enough to begin on, and we
can do a deal tow'rt the bit o' furniture you'll want. Thee 'st got
feathers and linen to spare--plenty, eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>This question was of course addressed to Mrs. Poyser, who was
wrapped up in a warm shawl and was too hoarse to speak with her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)



<p/>473

<p/>usual facility. At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) only nodded emphatically, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was
presently unable to resist the temptation to be more explicit.
<div class="bookquote">``It 'ud be a poor tale if I hadna feathers and linen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) said,
hoarsely, <div class="bookquote">``when I never sell a fowl but what's plucked, and the
wheel's a-going every day o' the week.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come, my wench,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser, when Hetty came down,
<div class="bookquote">``come and kiss us, and let us wish you luck.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>Hetty went very quietly and kissed the big good-natured man.
<div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) said, patting her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) on the back, <div class="bookquote">``go and kiss your
aunt and your grandfather. I'm as wishful t' have you settled well
as if you was my own daughter; and so's your aunt, I'll be bound,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)'s done by you this seven 'ear, Hetty, as if you'd been her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
own. Come, come, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) went on, becoming jocose, as soon as
Hetty had kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt and the old man, <div class="bookquote">``Adam wants a kiss
too, I'll warrant, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'s a right to one now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Hetty turned away, smiling, towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) empty chair.
<div class="bookquote">``Come, Adam, then, take one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>persisted Mr. Poyser, <div class="bookquote">``else y'
arena half a man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>Adam got up, blushing like a small maiden--great strong fellow
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was--and, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) arm round Hetty stooped down and
gently kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) lips.
It was a pretty scene in the red fire-light; for there were no
candles--why should there be, when the fire was so bright and
was reflected from all the pewter and the polished oak? No one
wanted to work on a Sunday evening. Even Hetty felt something
like contentment in the midst of all this love. Adam's attachment
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), Adam's caress, stirred no passion in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), were no longer
enough to satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) vanity, but they were the best her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) life offered
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) now--they promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) some change.



<p/>474

<p/>There was a great deal of discussion before Adam went away,
about the possibility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) finding a house that would do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
to settle in. No house was empty except the one next to Will
Maskery's in the village, and that was too small for Adam now. Mr.
Poyser insisted that the best plan would be for Seth and his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
mother to move and leave Adam in the old home, which might be
enlarged after a while, for there was plenty of space in the
woodyard and garden; but Adam objected to turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother
out.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser at last, <div class="bookquote">``we needna fix everything
to-night. We must take time to consider. You canna think o'
getting married afore Easter. I'm not for long courtships, but there
must be a bit o' time to make things comfortable.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser, in a hoarse whisper;
<div class="bookquote">``Christian folks can't be married like cuckoos, I reckon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm a bit daunted, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser, <div class="bookquote">``when I think as
we may have notice to quit, and belike be forced to take a farm
twenty mile off.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Eh,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, staring at the floor and lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) hands
up and down, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) arms rested on the elbows of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) chair, <div class="bookquote">``it's
a poor tale if I mun leave th' ould spot an be buried in a strange
parish. An' you'll happen ha' double rates to pay,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) added,
looking up at his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) son.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, thee mustna fret beforehand, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin Poyser/Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin the
younger. <div class="bookquote">``Happen the captain 'ull come home and make our peace

<p/>Chapter XXXV
The Hidden Dread

<p/>I

<p/>t was a busy time for Adam--the time between the beginning
of November and the beginning of February, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could see
little of Hetty, except on Sundays. But a happy time,
nevertheless, for it was taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) nearer and nearer to March,
when they were to be married, and all the little preparations for
their new housekeeping marked the progress towards the longedfor day. Two new rooms had been <div class="bookquote">``run up''  (<font color='red'><b>mother Seth</b></font>)</div>to the old house, for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother and Seth were to live with them after all. Lisbeth had
cried so piteously at the thought of leaving Adam that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had gone
to Hetty and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) if, for the love of him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would put up
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother's ways and consent to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). To his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) great
delight, Hetty said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes; I'd as soon she (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) lived with us as not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>Hetty's mind was oppressed at that moment with a worse difficulty
than poor Lisbeth's ways; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) could not care about them. So Adam
was consoled for the disappointment he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had felt when Seth had
come back from his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) visit to Snowfield and said <div class="bookquote">``it was no use--
Dinah's heart wasna turned towards marrying.''  (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>For when he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) told
his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) mother that Hetty was willing they should all live together and
there was no more need of them to think of parting, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said, in a
more contented tone than he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) speak in since it had
been settled that he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) was to be married, ``Eh, my lad, I'll be as still
as th' ould tabby, an' ne’er want to do aught but th' offal work, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) wonna like t' do. An' then we needna part the platters an'
things, as ha' stood on the shelf together sin' afore thee wast




<p/>476

<p/>born.''
There was only one cloud that now and then came across
Adam's sunshine: Hetty seemed unhappy sometimes. But to all his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
anxious, tender questions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) replied with an assurance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
was quite contented and wished nothing different; and the next
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was more lively than usual. It might be that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was a little overdone with work and anxiety now, for soon after
Christmas Mrs. Poyser had taken another cold, which had brought
on inflammation, and this illness had confined her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) room all
through January. Hetty had to manage everything downstairs, and
half-supply Molly's place too, while that good damsel waited on
her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) mistress, and she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) seemed to throw herself so entirely into her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>)
new functions, working with a grave steadiness which was new in
her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>), that Mr. Poyser often told Adam she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) was wanting to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
what a good housekeeper he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) would have; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) ``doubted the lass
was o’erdoing it--she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) must have a bit o' rest when her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) aunt could
come downstairs.''
This desirable event of Mrs. Poyser's coming downstairs
happened in the early part of February, when some mild weather
thawed the last patch of snow on the Binton Hills. On one of these
days, soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) aunt came down, Hetty went to Treddleston to
buy some of the wedding things which were wanting, and which
Mrs. Poyser had scolded her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) for neglecting, observing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
supposed <div class="bookquote">``it was because they were not for th' outside, else she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>)'d
ha' bought ’em fast enough.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was about ten o’clock when Hetty set off, and the slight hoarfrost that had whitened the hedges in the early morning had
disappeared as the sun mounted the cloudless sky. Bright
February days have a stronger charm of hope about them than



<p/>477

<p/>any other days in the year. One likes to pause in the mild rays of
the sun, and look over the gates at the patient plough-horses
turning at the end of the furrow, and think that the beautiful year
is all before one. The birds seem to feel just the same: their notes
are as clear as the clear air. There are no leaves on the trees and
hedgerows, but how green all the grassy fields are! And the dark
purplish brown of the ploughed earth and of the bare branches is
beautiful too. What a glad world this looks like, as one drives or
rides along the valleys and over the hills! I have often thought so
when, in foreign countries, where the fields and woods have
looked to me like our English Loamshire--the rich land tilled with
just as much care, the woods rolling down the gentle slopes to the
green meadows--I have come on something by the roadside which
has reminded me that I am not in Loamshire: an image of a great
agony--the agony of the Cross. It has stood perhaps by the
clustering apple-blossoms, or in the broad sunshine by the
cornfield, or at a turning by the wood where a clear brook was
gurgling below; and surely, if there came a traveller to this world
who knew nothing of the story of man's life upon it, this image of
agony would seem to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strangely out of place in the midst of this
joyous nature. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not know that hidden behind the appleblossoms, or among the golden corn, or under the shrouding
boughs of the wood, there might be a human heart beating heavily
with anguish--perhaps a young blooming girl, not knowing where
to turn for refuge from swift-advancing shame, understanding no
more of this life of ours than a foolish lost lamb wandering farther
and farther in the nightfall on the lonely heath, yet tasting the
bitterest of life's bitterness.
Such things are sometimes hidden among the sunny fields and



<p/>478

<p/>behind the blossoming orchards; and the sound of the gurgling
brook, if you came close to one spot behind a small bush, would be
mingled for your ear with a despairing human sob. No wonder
man's religion has much sorrow in it: no wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needs a
Suffering God.
Hetty, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) red cloak and warm bonnet, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) basket in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
hand, is turning towards a gate by the side of the Treddleston
road, but not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) may have a more lingering enjoyment of the
sunshine and think with hope of the long unfolding year. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
hardly knows that the sun is shining; and for weeks, now, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) has hoped at all, it has been for something at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) herself
trembles and shudders. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) only wants to be out of the high-road,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) may walk slowly and not care how her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) face looks, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
dwells on wretched thoughts; and through this gate she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) can get
into a field-path behind the wide thick hedgerows. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) great dark
eyes wander blankly over the fields like the eyes of one who is
desolate, homeless, unloved, not the promised bride of a brave
tender man. But there are no tears in them: her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) tears were all
wept away in the weary night, before she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) went to sleep. At the
next stile the pathway branches off: there are two roads before
her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)--one along by the hedgerow, which will by-and-by lead her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
into the road again, the other across the fields, which will take her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
much farther out of the way into the Scantlands, low shrouded
pastures where she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) will see nobody. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) chooses this and begins
to walk a little faster, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had suddenly thought of an object
towards which it was worth while to hasten. Soon she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) is in the
Scantlands, where the grassy land slopes gradually downwards,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) leaves the level ground to follow the slope. Farther on
there is a clump of trees on the low ground, and she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) is making her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)



<p/>479

<p/>way towards it. No, it is not a clump of trees, but a dark shrouded
pool, so full with the wintry rains that the under boughs of the
elder-bushes lie low beneath the water. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) sits down on the
grassy bank, against the stooping stem of the great oak that hangs
over the dark pool. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) has thought of this pool often in the nights
of the month that has just gone by, and now at last she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) is come to
see it. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) clasps her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) hands round her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) knees, and leans forward,
and looks earnestly at it, as if trying to guess what sort of bed it
would make for her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) young round limbs.
No, she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) has not courage to jump into that cold watery bed, and
if she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had, they might find her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)--they might find out why she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had
drowned herself. There is but one thing left to her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) must go
away, go where they can't find her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>).
After the first on-coming of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) great dread, some weeks after
her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) betrothal to Adam, she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had waited and waited, in the blind
vague hope that something would happen to set her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) free from her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
terror; but she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) could wait no longer. All the force of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) nature had
been concentrated on the one effort of concealment, and she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had
shrunk with irresistible dread from every course that could tend
towards a betrayal of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) miserable secret. Whenever the thought
of writing to Arthur had occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had rejected it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
could do nothing for her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) that would shelter her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) from discovery and
scorn among the relatives and neighbours who once more made
all her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) world, now her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) airy dream had vanished. Her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) imagination
no longer saw happiness with Arthur, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could do nothing that
would satisfy or soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) pride. No, something else would
happen--something must happen--to set her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) free from this dread.
In young, childish, ignorant souls there is constantly this blind
trust in some unshapen chance: it is as hard to a boy or girl to



<p/>480

<p/>believe that a great wretchedness will actually befall them as to
believe that they will die.
But now necessity was pressing hard upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)--now the time
of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) marriage was close at hand--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could no longer rest in this
blind trust. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must run away; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must hide herself where no
familiar eyes could detect her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); and then the terror of wandering
out into the world, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew nothing, made the
possibility of going to Arthur a thought which brought some
comfort with it. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt so helpless now, so unable to fashion the
future for herself, that the prospect of throwing herself on him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had
a relief in it which was stronger than her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pride. As she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat by the
pool and shuddered at the dark cold water, the hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would
receive her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tenderly--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would care for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and think for
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)--was like a sense of lulling warmth, that made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for the
moment indifferent to everything else; and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) began now to think
of nothing but the scheme by which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should get away.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had had a letter from Dinah lately, full of kind words about
the coming marriage, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had heard of from Seth; and
when Hetty had read this letter aloud to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) uncle, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had said, <div class="bookquote">``I
wish Dinah 'ud come again now, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'d be a comfort to your
aunt when you're gone. What do you think, my wench, o' going to
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) as soon as you can be spared and persuading her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) to come
back wi' you? You might happen persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) wi' telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) aunt wants her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), for all she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) writes o' not being able to come.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Hetty had not liked the thought of going to Snowfield, and felt no
longing to see Dinah, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) only said, <div class="bookquote">``It's so far off, Uncle.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But
now she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) thought this proposed visit would serve as a pretext for
going away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) aunt when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) got home again that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) should like the change of going to Snowfield for a week or ten



<p/>481

<p/>days. And then, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) got to Stoniton, where nobody knew
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would ask for the coach that would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) on the way to
Windsor. Arthur was at Windsor, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).
As soon as Hetty had determined on this scheme, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) rose from
the grassy bank of the pool, took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) basket, and went on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
way to Treddleston, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) must buy the wedding things she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had
come out for, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would never want them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) must be
careful not to raise any suspicion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was going to run away.
Mrs. Poyser was quite agreeably surprised that Hetty wished to
go and see Dinah and try to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) back to stay over the
wedding. The sooner she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) went the better, since the weather was
pleasant now; and Adam, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) came in the evening, said, if
Hetty could set off to-morrow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would make time to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
to Treddleston and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) safe into the Stoniton coach.
<div class="bookquote">``I wish I could go with you and take care of you, Hetty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) said,
the next morning, leaning in at the coach door; <div class="bookquote">``but you won't stay
much beyond a week--the time 'ull seem long.''
 (<font color='red'><b>coach</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) fondly, and his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) strong hand held hers in
its grasp. Hetty felt a sense of protection in his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) presence--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was
used to it now: if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could have had the past undone and known
no other love than her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) quiet liking for Adam! The tears rose as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) the last look.
<div class="bookquote">``God bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) for loving me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) went on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
way to work again, with Gyp at his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) heels.
But Hetty's tears were not for Adam--not for the anguish that
would come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) found she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was gone from him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) for
ever. They were for the misery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) own lot, which took her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) away
from this brave tender man who offered up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole life to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>),
and threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), a poor helpless suppliant, on the man who would



<p/>482

<p/>think it a misfortune that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was obliged to cling to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
At three o’clock that day, when Hetty was on the coach that was
to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), they said, to Leicester--part of the long, long way to
Windsor--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt dimly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) might be travelling all this weary
journey towards the beginning of new misery.
Yet Arthur was at Windsor; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would surely not be angry with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) did not mind about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) used to do, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had
promised to be good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>).

<p/>Chapter XXXVI
The Journey of Hope

<p/>A

<p/>long, lonely journey, with sadness in the heart; away from
the familiar to the strange: that is a hard and dreary thing
even to the rich, the strong, the instructed; a hard thing,
even when we are called by duty, not urged by dread.
What was it then to Hetty? With her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) poor narrow thoughts, no
longer melting into vague hopes, but pressed upon by the chill of
definite fear, repeating again and again the same small round of
memories--shaping again and again the same childish, doubtful
images of what was to come--seeing nothing in this wide world
but the little history of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) own pleasures and pains; with so little
money in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) pocket, and the way so long and difficult. Unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
could afford always to go in the coaches--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
could not, for the journey to Stoniton was more expensive than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had expected--it was plain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) must trust to carriers'
carts or slow waggons; and what a time it would be before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
could get to the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) journey! The burly old coachman from
Oakbourne, seeing such a pretty young woman among the outside
passengers, had invited her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to come and sit beside him (<font color='blue'><b>carriers</b></font>); and
feeling that it became him (<font color='blue'><b>carriers</b></font>) as a man and a coachman to open the
dialogue with a joke, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) applied himself as soon as they were off
the stones to the elaboration of one suitable in all respects. After
many cuts with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whip and glances at Hetty out of the corner of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips above the edge of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrapper and said,
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s pretty nigh six foot, I'll be bound, isna he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), now?''




 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>485

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>said Hetty, rather startled.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, the sweetheart as you've left behind, or else him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) as
you're goin' arter--which is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>Hetty felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) face flushing and then turning pale. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thought
this coachman must know something about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must know
Adam, and might tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was gone, for it is difficult to
country people to believe that those who make a figure in their
own parish are not known everywhere else, and it was equally
difficult to Hetty to understand that chance words could happen to
apply closely to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) circumstances. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was too frightened to
speak.
<div class="bookquote">``Hegh, hegh!''  (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div>said the coachman, seeing that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) joke was not
so gratifying as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had expected, <div class="bookquote">``you munna take it too ser'ous; if
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s behaved ill, get another. Such a pretty lass as you can get a
sweetheart any day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Hetty's fear was allayed by-and-by, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) found that the
coachman made no further allusion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) personal concerns; but
it still had the effect of preventing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) from asking him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) what were
the places on the road to Windsor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was only
going a little way out of Stoniton, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) got down at the
inn where the coach stopped, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hastened away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) basket
to another part of the town. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had formed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) plan of
going to Windsor, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had not foreseen any difficulties except that
of getting away, and after she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had overcome this by proposing the
visit to Dinah, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) thoughts flew to the meeting with Arthur and
the question how he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would behave to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)--not resting on any
probable incidents of the journey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was too entirely ignorant of
travelling to imagine any of its details, and with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) store of
money--her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) three guineas--in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) pocket, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) thought herself



<p/>486

<p/>amply provided. It was not until she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) found how much it cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) to
get to Stoniton that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) began to be alarmed about the journey,
and then, for the first time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) ignorance as to the places
that must be passed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) way. Oppressed with this new alarm,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) walked along the grim Stoniton streets, and at last turned into
a shabby little inn, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hoped to get a cheap lodging for the
night. Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) asked the landlord if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) what places
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) must go to, to get to Windsor.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I can't rightly say. Windsor must be pretty nigh London,
for it's where the king lives,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer. <div class="bookquote">``Anyhow, you'd best
go t' Ashby next--that's south'ard. But there's as many places
from here to London as there's houses in Stoniton, by what I can
make out. I've never been no traveller myself. But how comes a
lone young woman like you to be thinking o' taking such a journey
as that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to my brother--he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s a soldier at Windsor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>said
Hetty, frightened at the landlord's questioning look. <div class="bookquote">``I can't afford
to go by the coach; do you think there's a cart goes toward Ashby
in the morning?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, there may be carts if anybody knowed where they started
from; but you might run over the town before you found out.
You'd best set off and walk, and trust to summat overtaking you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>Every word sank like lead on Hetty's spirits; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) saw the
journey stretch bit by bit before her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) now. Even to get to Ashby
seemed a hard thing: it might take the day, for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knew, and
that was nothing to the rest of the journey. But it must be done--
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) must get to Arthur. Oh, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) yearned to be again with
somebody who would care for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) who had never got up in
the morning without the certainty of seeing familiar faces, people



<p/>487

<p/>on whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had an acknowledged claim; whose farthest journey
had been to Rosseter on the pillion with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) uncle; whose thoughts
had always been taking holiday in dreams of pleasure, because all
the business of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) life was managed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)--this kitten-like
Hetty, who till a few months ago had never felt any other grief
than that of envying Mary Burge a new ribbon, or being girded at
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt for neglecting Totty, must now make her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) toilsome way
in loneliness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) peaceful home left behind for ever, and nothing
but a tremulous hope of distant refuge before her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). Now for the first
time, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) lay down to-night in the strange hard bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) home had been a happy one, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) uncle had been very
good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) quiet lot at Hayslope among the things and
people she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knew, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) little pride in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) one best gown and
bonnet, and nothing to hide from any one, was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would
like to wake up to as a reality, and find that all the feverish life she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
had known besides was a short nightmare. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thought of all she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
had left behind with yearning regret for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) own sake. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) own
misery filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heart--there was no room in it for other people's
sorrow. And yet, before the cruel letter, Arthur had been so tender
and loving. The memory of that had still a charm for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), though it
was no more than a soothing draught that just made pain
bearable. For Hetty could conceive no other existence for herself
in future than a hidden one, and a hidden life, even with love,
would have had no delights for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>); still less a life mingled with
shame. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knew no romances, and had only a feeble share in the
feelings which are the source of romance, so that well-read ladies
may find it difficult to understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) state of mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was too
ignorant of everything beyond the simple notions and habits in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had been brought up to have any more definite idea of



<p/>488

<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) probable future than that Arthur would take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
somehow, and shelter her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) from anger and scorn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would not
marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) a lady; and apart from that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could
think of nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could give towards which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) looked with
longing and ambition.
The next morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) rose early, and taking only some milk
and bread for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) breakfast, set out to walk on the road towards
Ashby, under a leaden-coloured sky, with a narrowing streak of
yellow, like a departing hope, on the edge of the horizon. Now in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) faintness of heart at the length and difficulty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) journey,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was most of all afraid of spending her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) money, and becoming so
destitute that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would have to ask people's charity; for Hetty had
the pride not only of a proud nature but of a proud class--the class
that pays the most poor-rates, and most shudders at the idea of
profiting by a poor-rate. It had not yet occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
might get money for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) locket and earrings which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) carried
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) applied all her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) small arithmetic and knowledge
of prices to calculating how many meals and how many rides were
contained in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) two guineas, and the odd shillings, which had a
melancholy look, as if they were the pale ashes of the other brightflaming coin.
For the first few miles out of Stoniton, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) walked on bravely,
always fixing on some tree or gate or projecting bush at the most
distant visible point in the road as a goal, and feeling a faint joy
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had reached it. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) came to the fourth
milestone, the first she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had happened to notice among the long
grass by the roadside, and read that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was still only four miles
beyond Stoniton, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) courage sank. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had come only this little
way, and yet felt tired, and almost hungry again in the keen



<p/>489

<p/>morning air; for though Hetty was accustomed to much movement
and exertion indoors, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was not used to long walks which
produced quite a different sort of fatigue from that of household
activity. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was looking at the milestone she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt some drops
falling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) face--it was beginning to rain. Here was a new
trouble which had not entered into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) sad thoughts before, and
quite weighed down by this sudden addition to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) burden, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) sat
down on the step of a stile and began to sob hysterically. The
beginning of hardship is like the first taste of bitter food--it seems
for a moment unbearable; yet, if there is nothing else to satisfy our
hunger, we take another bite and find it possible to go on. When
Hetty recovered from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) burst of weeping, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) rallied her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) fainting
courage: it was raining, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) must try to get on to a village
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) might find rest and shelter. Presently, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) walked on
wearily, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heard the rumbling of heavy wheels behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>); a
covered waggon was coming, creeping slowly along with a
slouching driver cracking his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) whip beside the horses. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) waited
for it, thinking that if the waggoner were not a very sour-looking
man, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would ask him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) up. As the waggon approached
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), the driver had fallen behind, but there was something in the
front of the big vehicle which encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). At any previous
moment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) life she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would not have noticed it, but now, the new
susceptibility that suffering had awakened in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) caused this
object to impress her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) strongly. It was only a small white-and-livercoloured spaniel which sat on the front ledge of the waggon, with
large timid eyes, and an incessant trembling in the body, such as
you may have seen in some of these small creatures. Hetty cared
little for animals, as you know, but at this moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt as if the
helpless timid creature had some fellowship with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), and without



<p/>490

<p/>being quite aware of the reason, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was less doubtful about
speaking to the driver, who now came forward--a large ruddy
man, with a sack over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulders, by way of scarf or mantle.
<div class="bookquote">``Could you take me up in your waggon, if you're going towards
Ashby?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>said Hetty. <div class="bookquote">``I'll pay you for it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aw,''  (<font color='red'><b>the fellow</b></font>)</div>said the big fellow, with that slowly dawning smile which
belongs to heavy faces, <div class="bookquote">``I can take y' up fawst enough wi’out bein'
paid for 't if you dooant mind lyin' a bit closish a-top o' the woolpacks. Where do you coom from? And what do you want at
Ashby?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the fellow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I come from Stoniton. I'm going a long way--to Windsor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What! Arter some service, or what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Going to my brother--he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s a soldier there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm going no furder nor Leicester--and fur enough too--
but I'll take you, if you dooant mind being a bit long on the road.
Th' hosses wooant feel your weight no more nor they feel the little
doog there, as I puck up on the road a fortni't agoo. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) war lost, I
b'lieve, an's been all of a tremble iver sin'. Come, gi' us your basket
an' come behind and let me put y' in.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>To lie on the wool-packs, with a cranny left between the
curtains of the awning to let in the air, was luxury to Hetty now,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) half-slept away the hours till the driver came to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) wanted to get down and have <div class="bookquote">``some victual'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) himself was
going to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) dinner at this <div class="bookquote">``public.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Late at night they reached
Leicester, and so this second day of Hetty's journey was past. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
had spent no money except what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had paid for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) food, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt that this slow journeying would be intolerable for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
another day, and in the morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) way to a coachoffice to ask about the road to Windsor, and see if it would cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)



<p/>491

<p/>too much to go part of the distance by coach again. Yes! The
distance was too great--the coaches were too dear--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) must give
them up; but the elderly clerk at the office, touched by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) pretty
anxious face, wrote down for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) the names of the chief places she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
must pass through. This was the only comfort she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) got in Leicester,
for the men stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) went along the street, and for the
first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) life Hetty wished no one would look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) set
out walking again; but this day she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was fortunate, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was soon
overtaken by a carrier's cart which carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to Hinckley, and by
the help of a return chaise, with a drunken postilion--who
frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) by driving like Jehu the son of Nimshi, and
shouting hilarious remarks at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), twisting himself backwards on
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) saddle--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was before night in the heart of woody
Warwickshire: but still almost a hundred miles from Windsor, they
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). Oh what a large world it was, and what hard work for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) way in it! She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) went by mistake to Stratford-on-Avon,
finding Stratford set down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) list of places, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was
told she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had come a long way out of the right road. It was not till
the fifth day that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) got to Stony Stratford. That seems but a
slight journey as you look at the map, or remember your own
pleasant travels to and from the meadowy banks of the Avon. But
how wearily long it was to Hetty! It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) as if this country
of flat fields, and hedgerows, and dotted houses, and villages, and
market-towns--all so much alike to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) indifferent eyes--must
have no end, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) must go on wandering among them for ever,
waiting tired at toll-gates for some cart to come, and then finding
the cart went only a little way--a very little way--to the miller's a
mile off perhaps; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hated going into the public houses,
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) must go to get food and ask questions, because there



<p/>492

<p/>were always men lounging there, who stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and joked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
rudely. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) body was very weary too with these days of new
fatigue and anxiety; they had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) look more pale and worn
than all the time of hidden dread she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had gone through at home.
When at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) reached Stony Stratford, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) impatience and
weariness had become too strong for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) economical caution; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
determined to take the coach for the rest of the way, though it
should cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) all her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) remaining money. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would need nothing
at Windsor but to find Arthur. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had paid the fare for the
last coach, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had only a shilling; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) got down at the sign
of the Green Man in Windsor at twelve o’clock in the middle of the
seventh day, hungry and faint, the coachman came up, and begged
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to <div class="bookquote">``remember him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hand in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) pocket and took
out the shilling, but the tears came with the sense of exhaustion
and the thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was giving away her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) last means of getting
food, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) really required before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could go in search of
Arthur. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) held out the shilling, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) dark tearfilled eyes to the coachman's face and said, <div class="bookquote">``Can you give me back
sixpence?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said, gruffly, <div class="bookquote">``never mind--put the shilling up
again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The landlord of the Green Man had stood near enough to
witness this scene, and he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was a man whose abundant feeding
served to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) good nature, as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) person, in high
condition. And that lovely tearful face of Hetty's would have found
out the sensitive fibre in most men.
<div class="bookquote">``Come, young woman, come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and have a drop o'
something; you're pretty well knocked up, I can see that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) into the bar and said to his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) wife, ``Here, missis, take



<p/>493

<p/>this young woman into the parlour; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s a little overcome''--for
Hetty's tears were falling fast. They were merely hysterical tears:
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had no reason for weeping now, and was vexed
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was too weak and tired to help it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was at Windsor at
last, not far from Arthur.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) looked with eager, hungry eyes at the bread and meat and
beer that the landlady brought her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>), and for some minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>)
forgot everything else in the delicious sensations of satisfying
hunger and recovering from exhaustion. The landlady sat opposite
to her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) ate, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) earnestly. No wonder: Hetty
had thrown off her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) bonnet, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) curls had fallen down. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
face was all the more touching in its youth and beauty because of
its weary look, and the good woman's eyes presently wandered to
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) figure, which in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hurried dressing on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) journey she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
taken no pains to conceal; moreover, the stranger's eye detects
what the familiar unsuspecting eye leaves unnoticed.
``Why, you're not very fit for travelling,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, glancing while
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spoke at Hetty's ringless hand. ``Have you come far?''
``Yes,'' said Hetty, roused by this question to exert more selfcommand, and feeling the better for the food she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had taken. ``I've
come a good long way, and it's very tiring. But I'm better now.
Could you tell me which way to go to this place?'' Here Hetty took
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) pocket a bit of paper: it was the end of Arthur's letter on
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had written his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) address.
While she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was speaking, the landlord had come in and had
begun to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) as earnestly as his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) wife had done. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) took up
the piece of paper which Hetty handed across the table, and read
the address.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, what do you want at this house?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said. It is in the



<p/>494

<p/>nature of innkeepers and all men who have no pressing business
of their own to ask as many questions as possible before giving any
information.
<div class="bookquote">``I want to see a gentleman as is there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>said Hetty.
<div class="bookquote">``But there's no gentleman there,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned the landlord. <div class="bookquote">``It's
shut up--been shut up this fortnight. What gentleman is it you
want? Perhaps I can let you know where to find him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's Captain Donnithorne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>said Hetty tremulously, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heart
beginning to beat painfully at this disappointment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hope that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) should find Arthur at once.
<div class="bookquote">``Captain Donnithorne? Stop a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the landlord, slowly.
<div class="bookquote">``Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) in the Loamshire Militia? A tall young officer with a
fairish skin and reddish whiskers--and had a servant by the name
o' Pym?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>said Hetty; <div class="bookquote">``you know him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)--where is he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A fine sight o' miles away from here. The Loamshire Militia's
gone to Ireland; it's been gone this fortnight.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Look there! She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)'s fainting,''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>said the landlady, hastening to
support Hetty, who had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) miserable consciousness and
looked like a beautiful corpse. They carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to the sofa and
loosened her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) dress.
<div class="bookquote">``Here's a bad business, I suspect,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the landlord, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
brought in some water.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah, it's plain enough what sort of business it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wife</b></font>)</div>said the wife.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)'s not a common flaunting dratchell, I can see that. She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) looks
like a respectable country girl, and she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) comes from a good way off,
to judge by her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) tongue. She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) talks something like that ostler we had
that come from the north. He (<font color='blue'><b>ostler</b></font>) was as honest a fellow as we ever
had about the house--they're all honest folks in the north.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>495

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw a prettier young woman in my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>the husband</b></font>)</div>said the
husband. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s like a pictur in a shop-winder. It goes to one's

construction must have been supposed to have more <div class="bookquote">``conduct''
 (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>than beauty. <div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s coming to again. Fetch a drop more

<p/>Chapter XXXVII
The Journey in Despair

<p/>H

<p/>etty was too ill through the rest of that day for any
questions to be addressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>)--too ill even to think
with any distinctness of the evils that were to come. She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>)
only felt that all her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) hope was crushed, and that instead of having
found a refuge she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had only reached the borders of a new
wilderness where no goal lay before her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>). The sensations of bodily
sickness, in a comfortable bed, and with the tendance of the goodnatured landlady, made a sort of respite for her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>); such a respite as
there is in the faint weariness which obliges a man to throw
himself on the sand instead of toiling onward under the scorching
sun.
But when sleep and rest had brought back the strength
necessary for the keenness of mental suffering--when she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) lay the
next morning looking at the growing light which was like a cruel
task-master returning to urge from her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) a fresh round of hated
hopeless labour--she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) began to think what course she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) must take, to
remember that all her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) money was gone, to look at the prospect of
further wandering among strangers with the new clearness shed
on it by the experience of her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) journey to Windsor. But which way
could she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) turn? It was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) to enter into any service,
even if she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) could obtain it. There was nothing but immediate
beggary before her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) thought of a young woman who had been
found against the church wall at Hayslope one Sunday, nearly
dead with cold and hunger--a tiny infant in her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) arms. The woman



<p/>497

<p/>was rescued and taken to the parish. <div class="bookquote">``The parish!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>You can
perhaps hardly understand the effect of that word on a mind like
Hetty's, brought up among people who were somewhat hard in
their feelings even towards poverty, who lived among the fields,
and had little pity for want and rags as a cruel inevitable fate such
as they sometimes seem in cities, but held them a mark of idleness
and vice--and it was idleness and vice that brought burdens on
the parish. To Hetty the <div class="bookquote">``parish''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>was next to the prison in
obloquy, and to ask anything of strangers--to beg--lay in the same
far-off hideous region of intolerable shame that Hetty had all her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
life thought it impossible she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could ever come near. But now the
remembrance of that wretched woman whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had seen
herself, on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way from church, being carried into Joshua Rann's,
came back upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with the new terrible sense that there was
very little now to divide her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from the same lot. And the dread of
bodily hardship mingled with the dread of shame; for Hetty had
the luxurious nature of a round soft-coated pet animal.
How she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) yearned to be back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) safe home again, cherished
and cared for as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had always been! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt's scolding about
trifles would have been music to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) ears now; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) longed for it;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) used to hear it in a time when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had only trifles to hide.
Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) be the same Hetty that used to make up the butter in
the dairy with the gueldre roses peeping in at the window--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), a
runaway whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) friends would not open their doors to again,
lying in this strange bed, with the knowledge that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had no
money to pay for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) received, and must offer those
strangers some of the clothes in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) basket? It was then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) locket and ear-rings, and seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) pocket lie near,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) reached it and spread the contents on the bed before her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>).



<p/>498

<p/>There were the locket and ear-rings in the little velvet-lined boxes,
and with them there was a beautiful silver thimble which Adam
had bought her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), the words <div class="bookquote">``Remember me''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>making the ornament
of the border; a steel purse, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) one shilling in it; and a small
red-leather case, fastening with a strap. Those beautiful little earrings, with their delicate pearls and garnet, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had tried in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) ears with such longing in the bright sunshine on the 30th of
July! She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had no longing to put them in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) ears now: her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) head
with its dark rings of hair lay back languidly on the pillow, and the
sadness that rested about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) brow and eyes was something too
hard for regretful memory. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hands up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) ears: it
was because there were some thin gold rings in them, which were
also worth a little money. Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could surely get some money
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) ornaments: those Arthur had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) must have cost a
great deal of money. The landlord and landlady had been good to
her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>); perhaps they would help her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) to get the money for these
things.
But this money would not keep her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) long. What should she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) do
when it was gone? Where should she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) go? The horrible thought of
want and beggary drove her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) once to think she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) would go back to
her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) uncle and aunt and ask them to forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) and have pity on
her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) shrank from that idea again, as she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) might have
shrunk from scorching metal. She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) could never endure that shame
before her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) uncle and aunt, before Mary Burge, and the servants at
the Chase, and the people at Broxton, and everybody who knew
her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>). They should never know what had happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>). What
could she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) do? She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) would go away from Windsor--travel again as
she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had done the last week, and get among the flat green fields
with the high hedges round them, where nobody could see her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) or



<p/>499

<p/>know her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>); and there, perhaps, when there was nothing else she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>)
could do, she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) should get courage to drown herself in some pond
like that in the Scantlands. Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) would get away from Windsor
as soon as possible: she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) didn't like these people at the inn to know
about her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>), to know that she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had come to look for Captain
Donnithorne. She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) must think of some reason to tell them why she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>)
had asked for him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>).
With this thought she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) began to put the things back into her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>)
pocket, meaning to get up and dress before the landlady came to
her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) hand on the red-leather case, when it occurred to
her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) that there might be something in this case which she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had
forgotten--something worth selling; for without knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>)
should do with her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) life, she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) craved the means of living as long as
possible; and when we desire eagerly to find something, we are apt
to search for it in hopeless places. No, there was nothing but
common needles and pins, and dried tulip-petals between the
paper leaves where she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had written down her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) little moneyaccounts. But on one of these leaves there was a name, which,
often as she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had seen it before, now flashed on Hetty's mind like a
newly discovered message. The name was--Dinah Morris,
Snowfield. There was a text above it, written, as well as the name,
by Dinah's own hand with a little pencil, one evening that they
were sitting together and Hetty happened to have the red case
lying open before her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). Hetty did not read the text now: she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was
only arrested by the name. Now, for the first time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
remembered without indifference the affectionate kindness Dinah
had shown her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), and those words of Dinah in the bed-chamber--
that Hetty must think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) as a friend in trouble. Suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
were to go to Dinah, and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)? Dinah did not think



<p/>500

<p/>about things as other people did. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was a mystery to Hetty, but
Hetty knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was always kind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) couldn't imagine Dinah's
face turning away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) in dark reproof or scorn, Dinah's voice
willingly speaking ill of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), or rejoicing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) misery as a
punishment. Dinah did not seem to belong to that world of Hetty's,
whose glance she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) dreaded like scorching fire. But even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
Hetty shrank from beseeching and confession. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could not
prevail on herself to say, <div class="bookquote">``I will go to Dinah'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>: she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) only thought of
that as a possible alternative, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had not courage for death.
The good landlady was amazed when she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) saw Hetty come
downstairs soon after herself, neatly dressed, and looking
resolutely self-possessed. Hetty told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was quite well this
morning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had only been very tired and overcome with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
journey, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had come a long way to ask about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) brother,
who had run away, and they thought he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was gone for a soldier,
and Captain Donnithorne might know, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) had been very kind
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) brother once. It was a lame story, and the landlady looked
doubtfully at Hetty as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) told it; but there was a resolute air of
self-reliance about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) this morning, so different from the helpless
prostration of yesterday, that the landlady hardly knew how to
make a remark that might seem like prying into other people's
affairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) only invited her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) to sit down to breakfast with them,
and in the course of it Hetty brought out her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) ear-rings and locket,
and asked the landlord if he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) could help her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to get money for them.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) journey, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said, had cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) much more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) expected,
and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had no money to get back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) friends, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
wanted to do at once.
It was not the first time the landlady had seen the ornaments,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had examined the contents of Hetty's pocket yesterday,



<p/>501

<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) husband had discussed the fact of a country girl
having these beautiful things, with a stronger conviction than ever
that Hetty had been miserably deluded by the fine young officer.
<div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>said the landlord, when Hetty had spread the precious
trifles before him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``we might take ’em to the jeweller's shop, for
there's one not far off; but Lord bless you, they wouldn't give you a
quarter o' what the things are worth. And you wouldn't like to part
with ’em?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) added, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) inquiringly.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>said Hetty, hastily, <div class="bookquote">``so as I can get money to
go back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And they might think the things were stolen, as you wanted to
sell ’em,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``for it isn't usual for a young woman like you
to have fine jew'llery like that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The blood rushed to Hetty's face with anger. <div class="bookquote">``I belong to
respectable folks,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I'm not a thief.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, that you aren't, I'll be bound,''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>said the landlady; <div class="bookquote">``and
you'd no call to say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>looking indignantly at her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) husband.
<div class="bookquote">``The things were gev to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>): that's plain enough to be seen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean as I thought so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the husband</b></font>)</div>said the husband,
apologetically, <div class="bookquote">``but I said it was what the jeweller might think, and
so he (<font color='blue'><b>jeweller</b></font>) wouldn't be offering much money for ’em.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the husband</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wife</b></font>)</div>said the wife, <div class="bookquote">``suppose you were to advance some
money on the things yourself, and then if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) liked to redeem ’em
when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) got home, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could. But if we heard nothing from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
after two months, we might do as we liked with ’em.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the wife</b></font>)</div>I will not say that in this accommodating proposition the
landlady had no regard whatever to the possible reward of her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>)
good nature in the ultimate possession of the locket and ear-rings:
indeed, the effect they would have in that case on the mind of the



<p/>502

<p/>grocer's wife had presented itself with remarkable vividness to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
rapid imagination. The landlord took up the ornaments and
pushed out his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lips in a meditative manner. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wished Hetty well,
doubtless; but pray, how many of your well-wishers would decline
to make a little gain out of you? Your landlady is sincerely affected
at parting with you, respects you highly, and will really rejoice if
any one else is generous to you; but at the same time she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) hands
you a bill by which she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) gains as high a percentage as possible.
<div class="bookquote">``How much money do you want to get home with, young
woman?''  (<font color='red'><b>the well-wisher</b></font>)</div>said the well-wisher, at length.
<div class="bookquote">``Three guineas,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>answered Hetty, fixing on the sum she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) set out
with, for want of any other standard, and afraid of asking too
much.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I've ho objections to advance you three guineas,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the
landlord; <div class="bookquote">``and if you like to send it me back and get the jewellery
again, you can, you know. The Green Man isn't going to run
away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, I'll be very glad if you'll give me that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>said Hetty,
relieved at the thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would not have to go to the
jeweller's and be stared at and questioned.
<div class="bookquote">``But if you want the things again, you'll write before long,''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>said
the landlady, <div class="bookquote">``because when two months are up, we shall make up
our minds as you don't want ’em.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>said Hetty indifferently.
The husband and wife were equally content with this
arrangement. The husband thought, if the ornaments were not
redeemed, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could make a good thing of it by taking them to
London and selling them. The wife thought she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would coax the
good man into letting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) keep them. And they were



<p/>503

<p/>accommodating Hetty, poor thing--a pretty, respectable-looking
young woman, apparently in a sad case. They declined to take
anything for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) food and bed: she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was quite welcome. And at
eleven o’clock Hetty said <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>to them with the same quiet,
resolute air she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had worn all the morning, mounting the coach
that was to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) twenty miles back along the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had
come.
There is a strength of self-possession which is the sign that the
last hope has departed. Despair no more leans on others than
perfect contentment, and in despair pride ceases to be
counteracted by the sense of dependence.
Hetty felt that no one could deliver her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) from the evils that
would make life hateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>); and no one, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said to herself,
should ever know her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) misery and humiliation. No; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would not
confess even to Dinah. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would wander out of sight, and drown
herself where her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) body would never be found, and no one should
know what had become of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>).
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) got off this coach, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) began to walk again, and take
cheap rides in carts, and get cheap meals, going on and on without
distinct purpose, yet strangely, by some fascination, taking the
way she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had come, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was determined not to go back to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) own country. Perhaps it was because she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) mind
on the grassy Warwickshire fields, with the bushy tree-studded
hedgerows that made a hiding-place even in this leafless season.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) went more slowly than she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) came, often getting over the stiles
and sitting for hours under the hedgerows, looking before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) with
blank, beautiful eyes; fancying herself at the edge of a hidden pool,
low down, like that in the Scantlands; wondering if it were very
painful to be drowned, and if there would be anything worse after



<p/>504

<p/>death than what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) dreaded in life. Religious doctrines had taken
no hold on Hetty's mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was one of those numerous people
who have had godfathers and godmothers, learned their
catechism, been confirmed, and gone to church every Sunday, and
yet, for any practical result of strength in life, or trust in death,
have never appropriated a single Christian idea or Christian
feeling. You would misunderstand her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thoughts during these
wretched days, if you imagined that they were influenced either by
religious fears or religious hopes.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) chose to go to Stratford-on-Avon again, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had
gone before by mistake, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) remembered some grassy fields on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) former way towards it--fields among which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
might find just the sort of pool she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mind. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) took
care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) money still; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) basket; death seemed still a
long way off, and life was so strong in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) craved food and
rest--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hastened towards them at the very moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was
picturing to herself the bank from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would leap towards
death. It was already five days since she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had left Windsor, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
had wandered about, always avoiding speech or questioning looks,
and recovering her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) air of proud self-dependence whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
was under observation, choosing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) decent lodging at night, and
dressing herself neatly in the morning, and setting off on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) way
steadily, or remaining under shelter if it rained, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had a
happy life to cherish.
And yet, even in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) most self-conscious moments, the face was
sadly different from that which had smiled at itself in the old
specked glass, or smiled at others when they glanced at it
admiringly. A hard and even fierce look had come in the eyes,
though their lashes were as long as ever, and they had all their



<p/>505

<p/>dark brightness. And the cheek was never dimpled with smiles
now. It was the same rounded, pouting, childish prettiness, but
with all love and belief in love departed from it--the sadder for its
beauty, like that wondrous Medusa-face, with the passionate,
passionless lips.
At last she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was among the fields she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had been dreaming of, on a
long narrow pathway leading towards a wood. If there should be a
pool in that wood! It would be better hidden than one in the fields.
No, it was not a wood, only a wild brake, where there had once
been gravel-pits, leaving mounds and hollows studded with
brushwood and small trees. She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) roamed up and down, thinking
there was perhaps a pool in every hollow before she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) came to it, till
her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) limbs were weary, and she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) sat down to rest. The afternoon was
far advanced, and the leaden sky was darkening, as if the sun were
setting behind it. After a little while Hetty started up again, feeling
that darkness would soon come on; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) must put off finding
the pool till to-morrow, and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) way to some shelter for the
night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had quite lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) way in the fields, and might as well
go in one direction as another, for aught she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knew. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) walked
through field after field, and no village, no house was in sight; but
there, at the corner of this pasture, there was a break in the
hedges; the land seemed to dip down a little, and two trees leaned
towards each other across the opening. Hetty's heart gave a great
heat as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thought there must be a pool there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) walked
towards it heavily over the tufted grass, with pale lips and a sense
of trembling. It was as if the thing were come in spite of herself,
instead of being the object of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) search.
There it was, black under the darkening sky: no motion, no
sound near. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) set down her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) basket, and then sank down herself



<p/>506

<p/>on the grass, trembling. The pool had its wintry depth now: by the
time it got shallow, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) remembered the pools did at Hayslope,
in the summer, no one could find out that it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) body. But
then there was her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) basket--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) must hide that too. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) must
throw it into the water--make it heavy with stones first, and then
throw it in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) got up to look about for stones, and soon brought
five or six, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) laid down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) basket, and then sat
down again. There was no need to hurry--there was all the night
to drown herself in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) sat leaning her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) elbow on the basket. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
was weary, hungry. There were some buns in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) basket--three,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had supplied herself with at the place where she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) ate her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
dinner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) took them out now and ate them eagerly, and then sat
still again, looking at the pool. The soothed sensation that came
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) from the satisfaction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hunger, and this fixed dreamy
attitude, brought on drowsiness, and presently her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) head sank
down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knees. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was fast asleep.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) awoke it was deep night, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt chill. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was
frightened at this darkness--frightened at the long night before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could but throw herself into the water! No, not yet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
began to walk about that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) might get warm again, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
would have more resolution then. Oh how long the time was in
that darkness! The bright hearth and the warmth and the voices of
home, the secure uprising and lying down, the familiar fields, the
familiar people, the Sundays and holidays with their simple joys of
dress and feasting--all the sweets of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) young life rushed before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) now, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) seemed to be stretching her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) arms towards them
across a great gulf. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) set her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) teeth when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thought of Arthur.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cursed him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), without knowing what her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cursing would do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) too might know desolation, and cold, and a life of shame



<p/>507

<p/>that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) dared not end by death.
The horror of this cold, and darkness, and solitude--out of all
human reach--became greater every long minute. It was almost as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) were dead already, and knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was dead, and longed
to get back to life again. But no: she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was alive still; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had not
taken the dreadful leap. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt a strange contradictory
wretchedness and exultation: wretchedness, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) did not dare
to face death; exultation, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was still in life--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) might
yet know light and warmth again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) walked backwards and
forwards to warm herself, beginning to discern something of the
objects around her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), as her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eyes became accustomed to the night--
the darker line of the hedge, the rapid motion of some living
creature--perhaps a field-mouse--rushing across the grass. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
no longer felt as if the darkness hedged her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
could walk back across the field, and get over the stile; and then,
in the very next field, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) remembered there was a
hovel of furze near a sheepfold. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could get into that hovel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
would be warmer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could pass the night there, for that was
what Alick did at Hayslope in lambing-time. The thought of this
hovel brought the energy of a new hope. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) basket
and walked across the field, but it was some time before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) got in
the right direction for the stile. The exercise and the occupation of
finding the stile were a stimulus to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), however, and lightened
the horror of the darkness and solitude. There were sheep in the
next field, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) startled a group as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) set down her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) basket and
got over the stile; and the sound of their movement comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>),
for it assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) impression was right--this was the field
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had seen the hovel, for it was the field where the sheep
were. Right on along the path, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would get to it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)



<p/>508

<p/>reached the opposite gate, and felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) way along its rails and the
rails of the sheep-fold, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hand encountered the pricking of
the gorsy wall. Delicious sensation! She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had found the shelter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
groped her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) way, touching the prickly gorse, to the door, and
pushed it open. It was an ill-smelling close place, but warm, and
there was straw on the ground. Hetty sank down on the straw with
a sense of escape. Tears came--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had never shed tears before
since she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) left Windsor--tears and sobs of hysterical joy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
had still hold of life, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was still on the familiar earth, with
the sheep near her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). The very consciousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) own limbs was
a delight to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) turned up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) sleeves, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) arms
with the passionate love of life. Soon warmth and weariness lulled
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) in the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) sobs, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) fell continually into dozing,
fancying herself at the brink of the pool again--fancying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
had jumped into the water, and then awaking with a start, and
wondering where she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was. But at last deep dreamless sleep came;
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) head, guarded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) bonnet, found a pillow against the gorsy
wall, and the poor soul, driven to and fro between two equal
terrors, found the one relief that was possible to it--the relief of
unconsciousness.
Alas! That relief seems to end the moment it has begun. It
seemed to Hetty as if those dozen dreams had only passed into
another dream--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was in the hovel, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt was
standing over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) with a candle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) trembled under
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt's glance, and opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eyes. There was no candle, but
there was light in the hovel--the light of early morning through
the open door. And there was a face looking down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>); but it
was an unknown face, belonging to an elderly man in a smockfrock.



<p/>509

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what do you do here, young woman?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man said
roughly.
Hetty trembled still worse under this real fear and shame than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had done in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) momentary dream under her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) aunt's glance.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was like a beggar already--found sleeping in that
place. But in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) trembling, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was so eager to account to
the man for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) presence here, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) found words at once.
<div class="bookquote">``I lost my way,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm travelling--north'ard, and I got
away from the road into the fields, and was overtaken by the dark.
Will you tell me the way to the nearest village?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) got up as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was speaking, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
bonnet to adjust it, and then laid hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) basket.
The man looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) with a slow bovine gaze, without giving
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) any answer, for some seconds. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned away and
walked towards the door of the hovel, but it was not till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got
there that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood still, and, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder half-round
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), said, <div class="bookquote">``Aw, I can show you the way to Norton, if you
like. But what do you do gettin' out o' the highroad?''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added,
with a tone of gruff reproof. <div class="bookquote">``Y’ull be gettin' into mischief, if you
dooant mind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>said Hetty, <div class="bookquote">``I won't do it again. I'll keep in the road, if
you'll be so good as show me how to get to it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why dooant you keep where there's a finger-poasses an' folks
to ax the way on?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man said, still more gruffly. <div class="bookquote">``Anybody 'ud
think you was a wild woman, an' look at yer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>Hetty was frightened at this gruff old man, and still more at this
last suggestion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) looked like a wild woman. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) followed
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out of the hovel she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a sixpence for
telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) the way, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was wild.



<p/>510

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopped to point out the road to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hand in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
pocket to get the six-pence ready, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was turning away,
without saying good-morning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) held it out to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and said,
<div class="bookquote">``Thank you; will you please to take something for your trouble?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked slowly at the sixpence, and then said, <div class="bookquote">``I want none o'
your money. You'd better take care on 't, else you'll get it stool
from yer, if you go trapesin' about the fields like a mad woman athat’n.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>The man left her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) without further speech, and Hetty held on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
way. Another day had risen, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) must wander on. It was no
use to think of drowning herself--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could not do it, at least while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had money left to buy food and strength to journey on. But the
incident on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) waking this morning heightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) dread of that
time when her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) money would be all gone; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would have to sell
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) basket and clothes then, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would really look like a
beggar or a wild woman, as the man had said. The passionate joy
in life she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had felt in the night, after escaping from the brink of the
black cold death in the pool, was gone now. Life now, by the
morning light, with the impression of that man's hard wondering
look at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), was as full of dread as death--it was worse; it was a
dread to which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt chained, from which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shrank and
shrank as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did from the black pool, and yet could find no refuge
from it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took out her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) money from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) purse, and looked at it. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had still two-and-twenty shillings; it would serve her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for many
days more, or it would help her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to get on faster to Stonyshire,
within reach of Dinah. The thought of Dinah urged itself more
strongly now, since the experience of the night had driven her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
shuddering imagination away from the pool. If it had been only



<p/>511

<p/>going to Dinah--if nobody besides Dinah would ever know--Hetty
could have made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mind to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). The soft voice, the
pitying eyes, would have drawn her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). But afterwards the other
people must know, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could no more rush on that shame
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could rush on death.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) must wander on and on, and wait for a lower depth of
despair to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) courage. Perhaps death would come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was getting less and less able to bear the day's weariness. And
yet--such is the strange action of our souls, drawing us by a
lurking desire towards the very ends we dread--Hetty, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
set out again from Norton, asked the straightest road northwards
towards Stonyshire, and kept it all that day.
Poor wandering Hetty, with the rounded childish face and the
hard, unloving, despairing soul looking out of it--with the narrow
heart and narrow thoughts, no room in them for any sorrows but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) own, and tasting that sorrow with the more intense bitterness!
My heart bleeds for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) as I see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) toiling along on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) weary
feet, or seated in a cart, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eyes fixed vacantly on the road
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), never thinking or caring whither it tends, till hunger
comes and makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) desire that a village may be near.
What will be the end, the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) objectless wandering, apart
from all love, caring for human beings only through her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) pride,
clinging to life only as the hunted wounded brute clings to it?
God preserve you and me from being the beginners of such
misery!




<p/>512

<p/>Chapter XXXVIII
The Quest

<p/>T

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) first ten days after Hetty's departure passed as quietly
as any other days with the family at the Hall Farm, and
with Adam at his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) daily work. They had expected Hetty to
stay away a week or ten days at least, perhaps a little longer if
Dinah came back with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), because there might then be
something to detain them at Snowfield. But when a fortnight had
passed they began to feel a little surprise that Hetty did not return;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) must surely have found it pleasanter to be with Dinah than
any one could have supposed. Adam, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) part, was getting very
impatient to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) resolved that, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) did not appear
the next day -LRB-Saturday-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would set out on Sunday morning to
fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). There was no coach on a Sunday, but by setting out
before it was light, and perhaps getting a lift in a cart by the way,
he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) would arrive pretty early at Snowfield, and bring back Hetty
the next day--Dinah too, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) were coming. It was quite time
Hetty came home, and he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) would afford to lose his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) Monday for the
sake of bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>).
His (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) project was quite approved at the Farm when he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) went there
on Saturday evening. Mrs. Poyser desired him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) emphatically not to
come back without Hetty, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had been quite too long away,
considering the things she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had to get ready by the middle of
March, and a week was surely enough for any one to go out for
their health. As for Dinah, Mrs. Poyser had small hope of their
bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), unless they could make her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) believe the folks at




<p/>513

<p/>Hayslope were twice as miserable as the folks at Snowfield.
<div class="bookquote">``Though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser, by way of conclusion, <div class="bookquote">``you might tell
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s got but one aunt left, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s wasted pretty nigh to a
shadder; and we shall p'rhaps all be gone twenty mile farther off
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) next Michaelmas, and shall die o' broken hearts among
strange folks, and leave the children fatherless and motherless.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser, who certainly had the air of a man
perfectly heart-whole, <div class="bookquote">``it isna so bad as that. Thee 't looking rarely
now, and getting flesh every day. But I'd be glad for Dinah t' come,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'d help thee wi' the little uns: they took t' her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) wonderful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>So at daybreak, on Sunday, Adam set off. Seth went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)
the first mile or two, for the thought of Snowfield and the
possibility that Dinah might come again made him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) restless, and
the walk with Adam in the cold morning air, both in their best
clothes, helped to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) a sense of Sunday calm. It was the last
morning in February, with a low grey sky, and a slight hoar-frost
on the green border of the road and on the black hedges. They
heard the gurgling of the full brooklet hurrying down the hill, and
the faint twittering of the early birds. For they walked in silence,
though with a pleased sense of companionship.
<div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hand on Seth's shoulder
and looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) affectionately as they were about to part. <div class="bookquote">``I
wish thee wast going all the way wi' me, and as happy as I am.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm content, Addy, I'm content,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Seth cheerfully. <div class="bookquote">``I'll be
an old bachelor, belike, and make a fuss wi' thy children.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>They turned away from each other, and Seth walked leisurely
homeward, mentally repeating one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) favourite hymns--he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) was
very fond of hymns:




<p/>514

<p/>Dark and cheerless is the morn
Unaccompanied by thee:
Joyless is the day's return
Till thy mercy's beams I see:
Till thou inward light impart,
Glad my eyes and warm my heart.
Visit, then, this soul of mine,
Pierce the gloom of sin and grief--
Fill me, Radiancy Divine,
Scatter all my unbelief.
More and more thyself display,
Shining to the perfect day.
Adam walked much faster, and any one coming along the
Oakbourne road at sunrise that morning must have had a pleasant
sight in this tall broad-chested man, striding along with a carriage
as upright and firm as any soldier's, glancing with keen glad eyes
at the dark-blue hills as they began to show themselves on his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) way.
Seldom in Adam's life had his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) face been so free from any cloud of
anxiety as it was this morning; and this freedom from care, as is
usual with constructive practical minds like his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), made him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) all the
more observant of the objects round him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) and all the more ready to
gather suggestions from them towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) own favourite plans and
ingenious contrivances. His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) happy love--the knowledge that his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
steps were carrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) nearer and nearer to Hetty, who was so
soon to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)--was to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thoughts what the sweet morning air
was to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) sensations: it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) a consciousness of well-being
that made activity delightful. Every now and then there was a rush



<p/>515

<p/>of more intense feeling towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), which chased away other
images than Hetty; and along with that would come a wondering
thankfulness that all this happiness was given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)--that this
life of ours had such sweetness in it. For Adam had a devout mind,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was perhaps rather impatient of devout words, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
tenderness lay very close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) reverence, so that the one could
hardly be stirred without the other. But after feeling had welled up
and poured itself out in this way, busy thought would come back
with the greater vigour; and this morning it was intent on schemes
by which the roads might be improved that were so imperfect all
through the country, and on picturing all the benefits that might
come from the exertions of a single country gentleman, if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would
set himself to getting the roads made good in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own district.
It seemed a very short walk, the ten miles to Oakbourne, that
pretty town within sight of the blue hills, where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) break-fasted.
After this, the country grew barer and barer: no more rolling
woods, no more wide-branching trees near frequent homesteads,
no more bushy hedgerows, but grey stone walls intersecting the
meagre pastures, and dismal wide-scattered grey stone houses on
broken lands where mines had been and were no longer. <div class="bookquote">``A
hungry land,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam to himself. <div class="bookquote">``I'd rather go south'ard,
where they say it's as flat as a table, than come to live here; though
if Dinah likes to live in a country where she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) can be the most
comfort to folks, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s i' the right to live o' this side; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) must
look as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'d come straight from heaven, like th' angels in the
desert, to strengthen them as ha' got nothing t' eat.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And when at
last he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) came in sight of Snowfield, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought it looked like a town
that was <div class="bookquote">``fellow to the country,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>though the stream through the
valley where the great mill stood gave a pleasant greenness to the



<p/>516

<p/>lower fields. The town lay, grim, stony, and unsheltered, up the
side of a steep hill, and Adam did not go forward to it at present,
for Seth had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) where to find Dinah. It was at a thatched
cottage outside the town, a little way from the mill--an old cottage,
standing sideways towards the road, with a little bit of potatoground before it. Here Dinah lodged with an elderly couple; and if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) and Hetty happened to be out, Adam could learn where they
were gone, or when they would be at home again. Dinah might be
out on some preaching errand, and perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would have left
Hetty at home. Adam could not help hoping this, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
recognised the cottage by the roadside before him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), there shone out
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) face that involuntary smile which belongs to the expectation
of a near joy.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hurried his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) step along the narrow causeway, and rapped at
the door. It was opened by a very clean old woman, with a slow
palsied shake of the head.
<div class="bookquote">``Is Dinah Morris at home?''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam.
<div class="bookquote">``Eh? ... no,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman, looking up at this tall
stranger with a wonder that made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) slower of speech than usual.
<div class="bookquote">``Will you please to come in?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) added, retiring from the door, as
if recollecting herself. <div class="bookquote">``Why, ye're brother to the young man as
come afore, arena ye?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, entering. <div class="bookquote">``That was Seth Bede. I'm his (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam sat down patiently, not liking to hurry the shaking old



<p/>517

<p/>woman with questions, but looking eagerly towards the narrow
twisting stairs in one corner, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought it was possible Hetty
might have heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) voice and would come down them.
<div class="bookquote">``So you're come to see Dinah Morris?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman,
standing opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``An' you didn' know she (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was away from
home, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, <div class="bookquote">``but I thought it likely she (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) might be away,
seeing as it's Sunday. But the other young woman--is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at
home, or gone along with Dinah?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>The old woman looked at Adam with a bewildered air.
<div class="bookquote">``Gone along wi' her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Eh, Dinah's gone to Leeds, a

the money for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) journey. You may see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) room here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went
on, opening a door and not noticing the effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) words on
Adam. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) rose and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and darted an eager glance into
the little room with its narrow bed, the portrait of Wesley on the
wall, and the few books lying on the large Bible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wesley</b></font>) had had an
irrational hope that Hetty might be there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wesley</b></font>) could not speak in
the first moment after seeing that the room was empty; an
undefined fear had seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Wesley</b></font>)--something had happened to Hetty
on the journey. Still the old woman was so slow of; speech and
apprehension, that Hetty might be at Snowfield after all.
<div class="bookquote">``It's a pity ye didna know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Have ye come from your

 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know nobody by that name,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman,
wonderingly. <div class="bookquote">``Is it anybody ye've heared on at Snowfield?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did there come no young woman here--very young and

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div>The old woman had seen the ghastly look of fear in Adam's
face. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was not stunned or confounded: he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was thinking
eagerly where he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could inquire about Hetty.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes; a young woman started from our country to see Dinah,
Friday was a fortnight. I came to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) back. I'm afraid
something has happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). I can't stop. Good-bye.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hastened out of the cottage, and the old woman followed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to the gate, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) sadly with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shaking head as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
almost ran towards the town. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was going to inquire at the place
where the Oakbourne coach stopped.
No! No young woman like Hetty had been seen there. Had any
accident happened to the coach a fortnight ago? No. And there
was no coach to take him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) back to Oakbourne that day. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>)
would walk: he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) couldn't stay here, in wretched inaction. But the
innkeeper, seeing that Adam was in great anxiety, and entering
into this new incident with the eagerness of a man who passes a
great deal of time with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pockets looking into an
obstinately monotonous street, offered to take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back to
Oakbourne in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own <div class="bookquote">``taxed cart''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>this very evening. It was not



<p/>519

<p/>five o’clock; there was plenty of time for Adam to take a meal and
yet to get to Oakbourne before ten o’clock. The innkeeper
declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) really wanted to go to Oakbourne, and might as
well go to-night; he (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) should have all Monday before him (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) then.
Adam, after making an ineffectual attempt to eat, put the food in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) pocket, and, drinking a draught of ale, declared himself ready
to set off. As they approached the cottage, it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would do well to learn from the old woman where Dinah was to
be found in Leeds: if there was trouble at the Hall Farm--he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) only
half-admitted the foreboding that there would be--the Poysers
might like to send for Dinah. But Dinah had not left any address,
and the old woman, whose memory for names was infirm, could
not recall the name of the <div class="bookquote">``blessed woman''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>who was Dinah's chief
friend in the Society at Leeds.
During that long, long journey in the taxed cart, there was time
for all the conjectures of importunate fear and struggling hope. In
the very first shock of discovering that Hetty had not been to
Snowfield, the thought of Arthur had darted through Adam like a
sharp pang, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) tried for some time to ward off its return by
busying himself with modes of accounting for the alarming fact,
quite apart from that intolerable thought. Some accident had
happened. Hetty had, by some strange chance, got into a wrong
vehicle from Oakbourne: she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had been taken ill, and did not want
to frighten them by letting them know. But this frail fence of vague
improbabilities was soon hurled down by a rush of distinct
agonising fears. Hetty had been deceiving herself in thinking that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could love and marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had been loving Arthur all the
while; and now, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) desperation at the nearness of their
marriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had run away. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was gone to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). The old



<p/>520

<p/>indignation and jealousy rose again, and prompted the suspicion
that Arthur had been dealing falsely--had written to Hetty--had
tempted her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)--being unwilling, after all, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
should belong to another man besides himself. Perhaps the whole
thing had been contrived by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) directions
how to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to Ireland--for Adam knew that Arthur had
been gone thither three weeks ago, having recently learnt it at the
Chase. Every sad look of Hetty's, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had been engaged to
Adam, returned upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) now with all the exaggeration of painful
retrospect. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had been foolishly sanguine and confident. The
poor thing hadn't perhaps known her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) own mind for a long while;
had thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could forget Arthur; had been momentarily
drawn towards the man who offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) a protecting, faithful love.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) couldn't bear to blame her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) never meant to cause him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) this
dreadful pain. The blame lay with that man who had selfishly
played with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heart--had perhaps even deliberately lured her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
away.
At Oakbourne, the ostler at the Royal Oak remembered such a
young woman as Adam described getting out of the Treddleston
coach more than a fortnight ago--wasn't likely to forget such a
pretty lass as that in a hurry--was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) had not gone on by the
Buxton coach that went through Snowfield, but had lost sight of
her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) went away with the horses and had never set eyes on
her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) again. Adam then went straight to the house from which the
Stoniton coach started: Stoniton was the most obvious place for
Hetty to go to first, whatever might be her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) destination, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
would hardly venture on any but the chief coach-roads. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had
been noticed here too, and was remembered to have sat on the box
by the coachman; but the coachman could not be seen, for another



<p/>521

<p/>man had been driving on that road in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stead the last three or
four days. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could probably be seen at Stoniton, through inquiry
at the inn where the coach put up. So the anxious heart-stricken
Adam must of necessity wait and try to rest till morning--nay, till
eleven o’clock, when the coach started.
At Stoniton another delay occurred, for the old coachman who
had driven Hetty would not be in the town again till night. When
he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) did come he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) remembered Hetty well, and remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) own
joke addressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), quoting it many times to Adam, and
observing with equal frequency that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought there was
something more than common, because Hetty had not laughed
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) joked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) declared, as the people had done at the
inn, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had lost sight of Hetty directly she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) got down. Part of
the next morning was consumed in inquiries at every house in the
town from which a coach started---LRB-all in vain, for you know Hetty
did not start from Stoniton by coach, but on foot in the grey
morning-RRB---and then in walking out to the first toll-gates on the
different lines of road, in the forlorn hope of finding some
recollection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) there. No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was not to be traced any farther;
and the next hard task for Adam was to go home and carry the
wretched tidings to the Hall Farm. As to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) should do
beyond that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had come to two distinct resolutions amidst the
tumult of thought and feeling which was going on within him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) went to and fro. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would not mention what he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) knew of
Arthur Donnithorne's behaviour to Hetty till there was a clear
necessity for it: it was still possible Hetty might come back, and
the disclosure might be an injury or an offence to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). And as soon
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had been home and done what was necessary there to
prepare for his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) further absence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would start off to Ireland: if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)



<p/>522

<p/>found no trace of Hetty on the road, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would go straight to Arthur
Donnithorne and make himself certain how far he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) was acquainted
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) movements. Several times the thought occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>)
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) would consult Mr. Irwine, but that would be useless unless
he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) all, and so betrayed the secret about Arthur. It seems
strange that Adam, in the incessant occupation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mind about
Hetty, should never have alighted on the probability that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had
gone to Windsor, ignorant that Arthur was no longer there.
Perhaps the reason was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could not conceive Hetty's
throwing herself on Arthur uncalled; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) imagined no cause that
could have driven her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to such a step, after that letter written in
August. There were but two alternatives in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mind: either Arthur
had written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) again and enticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) away, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had simply
fled from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) approaching marriage with himself because she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
found, after all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) well enough, and yet was
afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) friends' anger if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) retracted.
With this last determination on his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mind, of going straight to
Arthur, the thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had spent two days in inquiries which
had proved to be almost useless, was torturing to Adam; and yet,
since he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would not tell the Poysers his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) conviction as to where
Hetty was gone, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) intention to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thither, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) must be
able to say to them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had traced her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) as far as possible.
It was after twelve o’clock on Tuesday night when Adam
reached Treddleston; and, unwilling to disturb his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother and
Seth, and also to encounter their questions at that hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) threw
himself without undressing on a bed at the <div class="bookquote">``Waggon
Overthrown,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and slept hard from pure weariness. Not more than
four hours, however, for before five o’clock he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) set out on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) way
home in the faint morning twilight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) always kept a key of the



<p/>523

<p/>workshop door in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) pocket, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could let himself in; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
wished to enter without awaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was anxious to
avoid telling her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) the new trouble himself by seeing Seth first, and
asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) when it should be necessary. He (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) walked
gently along the yard, and turned the key gently in the door; but,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) expected, Gyp, who lay in the workshop, gave a sharp bark.
It subsided when he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) saw Adam, holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) finger at him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) to
impose silence, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) dumb, tailless joy he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) must content
himself with rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) body against his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) master's legs.
Adam was too heart-sick to take notice of Gyp's fondling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
threw himself on the bench and stared dully at the wood and the
signs of work around him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), wondering if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) should ever come to
feel pleasure in them again, while Gyp, dimly aware that there was
something wrong with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) master, laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) rough grey head on
Adam's knee and wrinkled his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) brows to look up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). Hitherto,
since Sunday afternoon, Adam had been constantly among
strange people and in strange places, having no associations with
the details of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) daily life, and now that by the light of this new
morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was come back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) home and surrounded by the
familiar objects that seemed for ever robbed of their charm, the
reality--the hard, inevitable reality of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) troubles pressed upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) with a new weight. Right before him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was an unfinished chest
of drawers, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had been making in spare moments for
Hetty's use, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) home should be hers.
Seth had not heard Adam's entrance, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had been roused
by Gyp's bark, and Adam heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) moving about in the room
above, dressing himself. Seth's first thoughts were about his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)
brother: he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) would come home to-day, surely, for the business
would be wanting him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) sadly by to-morrow, but it was pleasant to



<p/>524

<p/>think he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had had a longer holiday than he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had expected. And
would Dinah come too? Seth felt that that was the greatest
happiness he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) could look forward to for himself, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had no
hope left that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would ever love him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) well enough to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>);
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had often said to himself, it was better to be Dinah's friend
and brother than any other woman's husband. If he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could but be
always near her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), instead of living so far off!
He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) came downstairs and opened the inner door leading from
the kitchen into the workshop, intending to let out Gyp; but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
stood still in the doorway, smitten with a sudden shock at the sight
of Adam seated listlessly on the bench, pale, unwashed, with
sunken blank eyes, almost like a drunkard in the morning. But
Seth felt in an instant what the marks meant--not drunkenness,
but some great calamity. Adam looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) without
speaking, and Seth moved forward towards the bench, himself
trembling so that speech did not come readily.
<div class="bookquote">``God have mercy on us, Addy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, in a low voice, sitting
down on the bench beside Adam, <div class="bookquote">``what is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam was unable to speak. The strong man, accustomed to
suppress the signs of sorrow, had felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) heart swell like a child's
at this first approach of sympathy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) fell on Seth's neck and
sobbed.
Seth was prepared for the worst now, for, even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)
recollections of their boyhood, Adam had never sobbed before.
<div class="bookquote">``Is it death, Adam? Is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dead?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) asked, in a low tone, when
Adam raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) head and was recovering himself.
``No, lad; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s gone--gone away from us. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s never been
to Snowfield. Dinah's been gone to Leeds ever since last Friday
was a fortnight, the very day Hetty set out. I can't find out where



<p/>525

<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) went after she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) got to Stoniton.''
Seth was silent from utter astonishment: he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) knew nothing that
could suggest to him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) a reason for Hetty's going away.
``Hast any notion what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s done it for?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) said, at last.
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) can't ha' loved me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) didn't like our marriage when it
came nigh--that must be it,'' said Adam. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had determined to
mention no further reason.
``I hear Mother stirring,'' said Seth. ``Must we tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)?''
``No, not yet,'' said Adam, rising from the bench and pushing
the hair from his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) face, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) wanted to rouse himself. ``I can't
have her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) told yet; and I must set out on another journey directly,
after I've been to the village and th' Hall Farm. I can't tell thee
where I'm going, and thee must say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) I'm gone on business as
nobody is to know anything about. I'll go and wash myself now.''
Adam moved towards the door of the workshop, but after a step or
two he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) turned round, and, meeting Seth's eyes with a calm sad
glance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) said, ``I must take all the money out o' the tin box, lad;
but if anything happens to me, all the rest 'll be thine, to take care
o' Mother with.''
Seth was pale and trembling: he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) felt there was some terrible
secret under all this. ``Brother,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) said, faintly--he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) never called
Adam ``Brother'' except in solemn moments--``I don't believe
you'll do anything as you can't ask God's blessing on.''
``Nay, lad,'' said Adam, <div class="bookquote">``don't be afraid. I'm for doing nought
but what's a man's duty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nay lad</b></font>)</div>The thought that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) betrayed his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) trouble to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
would only distress him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) by words, half of blundering affection, half
of irrepressible triumph that Hetty proved as unfit to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) wife as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had always foreseen, brought back some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) habitual



<p/>526

<p/>firmness and self-command. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had felt ill on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) journey home--
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) came down--had stayed all night at
Treddleston for that reason; and a bad headache, that still hung
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) this morning, accounted for his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) paleness and heavy
eyes.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) determined to go to the village, in the first place, attend to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) business for an hour, and give notice to Burge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) being
obliged to go on a journey, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) must beg him (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) not to mention
to any one; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) wished to avoid going to the Hall Farm near
breakfast-time, when the children and servants would be in the
house-place, and there must be exclamations in their hearing
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) having returned without Hetty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) waited until the clock
struck nine before he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) left the work-yard at the village, and set off,
through the fields, towards the Farm. It was an immense relief to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) came near the Home Close, to see Mr. Poyser
advancing towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>), for this would spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) the pain of going
to the house. Mr. Poyser was walking briskly this March morning,
with a sense of spring business on his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) mind: he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was going to cast
the master's eye on the shoeing of a new cart-horse, carrying his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
spud as a useful companion by the way. His (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) surprise was great
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) caught sight of Adam, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was not a man given to
presentiments of evil.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, Adam, lad, is't you? Have ye been all this time away and
not brought the lasses back, after all? Where are they?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I've not brought ’em,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, turning round, to
indicate that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) wished to walk back with Mr. Poyser.
<div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin Poyser/Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin, looking with sharper attention at Adam,
<div class="bookquote">``ye look bad. Is there anything happened?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, heavily. ``A sad thing's happened. I didna



<p/>527

<p/>find Hetty at Snowfield.''
Mr. Poyser's good-natured face showed signs of troubled
astonishment. ``Not find her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)? What's happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thoughts flying at once to bodily accident.
``That I can't tell, whether anything's happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
never went to Snowfield--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) took the coach to Stoniton, but I
can't learn nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) after she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) got down from the Stoniton
coach.''
``Why, you donna mean she (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>)'s run away?'' said Martin, standing
still, so puzzled and bewildered that the fact did not yet make itself
felt as a trouble by him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>).
``She (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>) must ha' done,'' said Adam. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>) didn't like our marriage
when it came to the point--that must be it. She (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>)'d mistook her (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>)
feelings.''
Martin was silent for a minute or two, looking on the ground
and rooting up the grass with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) spud, without knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
was doing. His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) usual slowness was always trebled when the
subject of speech was painful. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) looked up, right in Adam's
face, saying, ``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>) didna deserve t' ha' ye, my lad. An' I feel i'
fault myself, for she (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>) was my niece, and I was allays hot for her (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>)
marr'ing ye. There's no amends I can make ye, lad--the more's
the pity: it's a sad cut-up for ye, I doubt.''
Adam could say nothing; and Mr. Poyser, after pursuing his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
walk for a little while, went on, ``I'll be bound she (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>)'s gone after
trying to get a lady's maid's place, for she (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>)'d got that in her (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>) head
half a year ago, and wanted me to gi' my consent. But I'd thought
better on her (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>)''--he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) added, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) head slowly and sadly--<div class="bookquote">``I'd
thought better on her (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>), nor to look for this, after she (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>)'d gi’en y' her (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>)
word, an' everything been got ready.''



 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>528

<p/>Adam had the strongest motives for encouraging this
supposition in Mr. Poyser, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) even tried to believe that it
might possibly be true. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had no warrant for the certainty that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was gone to Arthur.
<div class="bookquote">``It was better it should be so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said, as quietly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could, <div class="bookquote">``if
she (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>) couldn't like me for a husband. Better run away before
than repent after. I hope you won't look harshly on her (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>)
comes back, as she (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>) may do if she (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>) finds it hard to get on away from
home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I canna look on her (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>) as I've done before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin Poyser/Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin
decisively. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>)'s acted bad by you, and by all of us. But I'll not
turn my back on her (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>)'s but a young un, and it's the first harm
I've knowed on her (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>). It'll be a hard job for me to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>donna</b></font>) aunt. Why
didna Dinah come back wi' ye? She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'d ha' helped to pacify her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) aunt
a bit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dinah wasn't at Snowfield. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s been gone to Leeds this
fortnight, and I couldn't learn from th' old woman any direction
where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is at Leeds, else I should ha' brought it you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d a deal better be staying wi' her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own kin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Poyser, indignantly, <div class="bookquote">``than going preaching among strange folks athat’n.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I must leave you now, Mr. Poyser,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, <div class="bookquote">``for I've a deal
to see to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye, you'd best be after your business, and I must tell the
missis when I go home. It's a hard job.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, <div class="bookquote">``I beg particular, you'll keep what's
happened quiet for a week or two. I've not told my mother yet, and
there's no knowing how things may turn out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>``Aye, aye; least said, soonest mended. We’n no need to say why



<p/>529

<p/>the match is broke off, an' we may hear of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) after a bit. Shake
hands wi' me, lad: I wish I could make thee amends.''
There was something in Martin Poyser's throat at that moment
which caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to bring out those scanty words in rather a
broken fashion. Yet Adam knew what they meant all the better,
and the two honest men grasped each other's hard hands in
mutual understanding.
There was nothing now to hinder Adam from setting off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
had told Seth to go to the Chase and leave a message for the
squire, saying that Adam Bede had been obliged to start off
suddenly on a journey--and to say as much, and no more, to any
one else who made inquiries about him (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>). If the Poysers learned
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) was gone away again, Adam knew they would infer that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
was gone in search of Hetty.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had intended to go right on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) way from the Hall Farm, but
now the impulse which had frequently visited him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) before--to go to
Mr. Irwine, and make a confidant of him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)--recurred with the new
force which belongs to a last opportunity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) was about to start on
a long journey--a difficult one--by sea--and no soul would know
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) was gone. If anything happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)? Or, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
absolutely needed help in any matter concerning Hetty? Mr.
Irwine was to be trusted; and the feeling which made Adam shrink
from telling anything which was her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) secret must give way before
the need there was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) should have some one else besides
himself who would be prepared to defend her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) in the worst
extremity. Towards Arthur, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) might have incurred
no new guilt, Adam felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was not bound to keep silence
when Hetty's interest called on him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to speak.
<div class="bookquote">``I must do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Adam, when these thoughts, which had



<p/>530

<p/>spread themselves through hours of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) sad journeying, now
rushed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) in an instant, like a wave that had been slowly
gathering; <div class="bookquote">``it's the right thing. I can't stand alone in this way any
longer.''




 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>531

<p/>Chapter XXXIX
The Tidings

<p/>A

<p/>dam turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) face towards Broxton and walked with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
swiftest stride, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) watch with the fear that Mr.
Irwine might be gone out--hunting, perhaps. The fear
and haste together produced a state of strong excitement before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) reached the rectory gate, and outside it he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) saw the deep marks
of a recent hoof on the gravel.
But the hoofs were turned towards the gate, not away from it,
and though there was a horse against the stable door, it was not
Mr. Irwine's: it had evidently had a journey this morning, and
must belong to some one who had come on business. Mr. Irwine
was at home, then; but Adam could hardly find breath and
calmness to tell Carroll that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) wanted to speak to the rector. The
double suffering of certain and uncertain sorrow had begun to
shake the strong man. The butler looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) wonderingly, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) threw himself on a bench in the passage and stared absently at
the clock on the opposite wall. The master had somebody with
him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said, but he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) heard the study door open--the stranger
seemed to be coming out, and as Adam was in a hurry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would
let the master know at once.
Adam sat looking at the clock: the minute-hand was hurrying
along the last five minutes to ten with a loud, hard, indifferent tick,
and Adam watched the movement and listened to the sound as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had had some reason for doing so. In our times of bitter
suffering there are almost always these pauses, when our




<p/>532

<p/>consciousness is benumbed to everything but some trivial
perception or sensation. It is as if semi-idiocy came to give us rest
from the memory and the dread which refuse to leave us in our
sleep.
Carroll, coming back, recalled Adam to the sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) burden.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was to go into the study immediately. <div class="bookquote">``I can't think what that
strange person's come about,''  (<font color='red'><b>the butler</b></font>)</div>the butler added, from mere
incontinence of remark, as he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) preceded Adam to the door, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'s
gone i' the dining-room. And master looks unaccountable--as if he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
was frightened.''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam took no notice of the words: he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could not
care about other people's business. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) entered the study
and looked in Mr. Irwine's face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) felt in an instant that there was
a new expression in it, strangely different from the warm
friendliness it had always worn for him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) before. A letter lay open on
the table, and Mr. Irwine's hand was on it, but the changed glance
he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) cast on Adam could not be owing entirely to preoccupation
with some disagreeable business, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was looking eagerly
towards the door, as if Adam's entrance were a matter of poignant
anxiety to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``You want to speak to me, Adam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, in that low
constrainedly quiet tone which a man uses when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is determined
to suppress agitation. <div class="bookquote">``Sit down here.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pointed to a chair just
opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), at no more than a yard's distance from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own,
and Adam sat down with a sense that this cold manner of Mr.
Irwine's gave an additional unexpected difficulty to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) disclosure.
But when Adam had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mind to a measure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was not
the man to renounce it for any but imperative reasons.
<div class="bookquote">``I come to you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, ``as the gentleman I look up to
most of anybody. I've something very painful to tell you--



<p/>533

<p/>something as it'll pain you to hear as well as me to tell. But if I
speak o' the wrong other people have done, you'll see I didn't
speak till I'd good reason.''
Mr. Irwine nodded slowly, and Adam went on rather
tremulously, ``You was t' ha' married me and Hetty Sorrel, you
know, sir, o' the fifteenth o' this month. I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>) loved me,
and I was th' happiest man i' the parish. But a dreadful blow's
come upon me.''
Mr. Irwine started up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) chair, as if involuntarily, but
then, determined to control himself, walked to the window and
looked out.
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>)'s gone away, sir, and we don't know where. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>)
was going to Snowfield o' Friday was a fortnight, and I went last
Sunday to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>) back; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>)'d never been there, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>)
took the coach to Stoniton, and beyond that I can't trace her (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>). But
now I'm going a long journey to look for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>), and I can't trust t'
anybody but you where I'm going.''
Mr. Irwine came back from the window and sat down.
``Have you no idea of the reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>) went away?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) said.
``It's plain enough she (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>) didn't want to marry me, sir,'' said Adam.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>) didn't like it when it came so near. But that isn't all, I doubt.
There's something else I must tell you, sir. There's somebody else
concerned besides me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A gleam of something--it was almost like relief or joy--came
across the eager anxiety of Mr. Irwine's face at that moment.
Adam was looking on the ground, and paused a little: the next
words were hard to speak. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) went on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
head and looked straight at Mr. Irwine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) would do the thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
had resolved to do, without flinching.



<p/>534

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know who's the man I've reckoned my greatest friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``and used to be proud to think as I should pass my life i'
working for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and had felt so ever since we were lads ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mr. Irwine, as if all self-control had forsaken him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>), grasped
Adam's arm, which lay on the table, and, clutching it tightly like a
man in pain, said, with pale lips and a low hurried voice, <div class="bookquote">``No,
Adam, no--don't say it, for God's sake!''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>Adam, surprised at the violence of Mr. Irwine's feeling,
repented of the words that had passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) lips and sat in
distressed silence. The grasp on his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) arm gradually relaxed, and
Mr. Irwine threw himself back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) chair, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Go on--I must
know it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div>``That man played with Hetty's feelings, and behaved to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d no right to do to a girl in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) station o' life--made her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
presents and used to go and meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) out a-walking. I found it out
only two days before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went away--found him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a-kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) as
they were parting in the Grove. There'd been nothing said
between me and Hetty then, though I'd loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) for a long while,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knew it. But I reproached him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrong actions, and
words and blows passed between us; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said solemnly to me,
after that, as it had been all nonsense and no more than a bit o'
flirting. But I made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) write a letter to tell Hetty he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d meant
nothing, for I saw clear enough, sir, by several things as I hadn't
understood at the time, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d got hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heart, and I thought
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'d belike go on thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and never come to love another
man as wanted to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). And I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) the letter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
seemed to bear it all after a while better than I'd expected ... and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) behaved kinder and kinder to me ... I daresay she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) didn't
know her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) own feelings then, poor thing, and they came back upon



<p/>535

<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) when it was too late ... I don't want to blame her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) ... I can't
think as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) meant to deceive me. But I was encouraged to think
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) loved me, and--you know the rest, sir. But it's on my mind as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s been false to me, and 'ticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) away, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s gone to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)--
and I'm going now to see, for I can never go to work again till I
know what's become of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>).''
During Adam's narrative, Mr. Irwine had had time to recover
his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) self-mastery in spite of the painful thoughts that crowded upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>). It was a bitter remembrance to him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) now--that morning when
Arthur breakfasted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) and seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) were on the
verge of a confession. It was plain enough now what he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had
wanted to confess. And if their words had taken another turn ... if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) himself had been less fastidious about intruding on another
man's secrets ... it was cruel to think how thin a film had shut out
rescue from all this guilt and misery. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) saw the whole history
now by that terrible illumination which the present sheds back
upon the past. But every other feeling as it rushed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was
thrown into abeyance by pity, deep respectful pity, for the man
who sat before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--already so bruised, going forth with sad blind
resignedness to an unreal sorrow, while a real one was close upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), too far beyond the range of common trial for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ever to have
feared it. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own agitation was quelled by a certain awe that
comes over us in the presence of a great anguish, for the anguish
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must inflict on Adam was already present to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Again he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand on the arm that lay on the table, but very gently this time,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said solemnly:
``Adam, my dear friend, you have had some hard trials in your
life. You can bear sorrow manfully, as well as act manfully. God
requires both tasks at our hands. And there is a heavier sorrow



<p/>536

<p/>coming upon you than any you have yet known. But you are not
guilty--you have not the worst of all sorrows. God help him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) who
has!''
The two pale faces looked at each other; in Adam's there was
trembling suspense, in Mr. Irwine's hesitating, shrinking pity. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) went on.
``I have had news of Hetty this morning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) is not gone to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) is in Stonyshire--at Stoniton.''
Adam started up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) chair, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could have
leaped to her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) that moment. But Mr. Irwine laid hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) arm
again and said, persuasively, ``Wait, Adam, wait.'' So he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) sat down.
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) is in a very unhappy position--one which will make it
worse for you to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), my poor friend, than to have lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) for
ever.''
Adam's lips moved tremulously, but no sound came. They
moved again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) whispered, ``Tell me.''
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) has been arrested ... she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) is in prison.''
It was as if an insulting blow had brought back the spirit of
resistance into Adam. The blood rushed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said,
loudly and sharply, ``For what?''
``For a great crime--the murder of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) child.''
``It can't be!'' Adam almost shouted, starting up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) cnair
and making a stride towards the door; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) turned round again,
setting his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) back against the bookcase, and looking fiercely at Mr.
Irwine. ``It isn't possible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) never had a child. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) can't be
guilty. Who says it?''
``God grant she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) may be innocent, Adam. We can still hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
is.''
``But who says she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) is guilty?'' said Adam violently. ``Tell me



<p/>537

<p/>everything.''
``Here is a letter from the magistrate before whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was
taken, and the constable who arrested her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) is in the dining-room.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) will not confess her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) name or where she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) comes from; but I fear,
I fear, there can be no doubt it is Hetty. The description of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
person corresponds, only that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) is said to look very pale and ill.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had a small red-leather pocket-book in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) pocket with two
names written in it--one at the beginning, `Hetty Sorrel,
Hayslope,' and the other near the end, `Dinah Morris, Snowfield.'
She (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) will not say which is her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) own name--she (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) denies everything,
and will answer no questions, and application has been made to
me, as a magistrate, that I may take measures for identifying her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>),
for it was thought probable that the name which stands first is her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
own name.''
``But what proof have they got against her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), if it is Hetty?'' said
Adam, still violently, with an effort that seemed to shake his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) whole
frame. ``I'll not believe it. It couldn't ha' been, and none of us know
it.''
``Terrible proof that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was under the temptation to commit
the crime; but we have room to hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) did not really
commit it. Try and read that letter, Adam.''
Adam took the letter between his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) shaking hands and tried to fix
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) eyes steadily on it. Mr. Irwine meanwhile went out to give
some orders. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) came back, Adam's eyes were still on the
first page--he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) couldn't read--he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could not put the words together
and make out what they meant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) threw it down at last and
clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) fist.
``It's his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) doing,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said; ``if there's been any crime, it's at his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
door, not at hers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to deceive--he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) deceived me first.



<p/>538

<p/>Let ’em put him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) trial--let him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) stand in court beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), and
I'll tell ’em how he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) got hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heart, and 'ticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) t' evil, and
then lied to me. Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to go free, while they lay all the punishment
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) ... so weak and young?''
The image called up by these last words gave a new direction to
poor Adam's maddened feelings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was silent, looking at the
corner of the room as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) saw something there. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) burst out
again, in a tone of appealing anguish,
``I can't bear it ... O God, it's too hard to lay upon me--it's too
hard to think she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)'s wicked.''
Mr. Irwine had sat down again in silence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) was too wise to
utter soothing words at present, and indeed, the sight of Adam
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), with that look of sudden age which sometimes comes
over a young face in moments of terrible emotion--the hard
bloodless look of the skin, the deep lines about the quivering
mouth, the furrows in the brow--the sight of this strong firm man
shattered by the invisible stroke of sorrow, moved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so deeply
that speech was not easy. Adam stood motionless, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) eyes
vacantly fixed in this way for a minute or two; in that short space
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was living through all his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) love again.
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) can't ha' done it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, still without moving his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) eyes, as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) were only talking to himself: ``it was fear made her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hide it ...
I forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) for deceiving me ... I forgive thee, Hetty ... thee
wast deceived too ... it's gone hard wi' thee, my poor Hetty ... but
they'll never make me believe it.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was silent again for a few moments, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, with
fierce abruptness, ``I'll go to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)--I'll bring him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) back--I'll make
him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) go and look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) misery--he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shall look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
can't forget it--it shall follow him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) night and day--as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)



<p/>539

<p/>lives it shall follow him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shan't escape wi' lies this time--I'll
fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), I'll drag him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) myself.''
In the act of going towards the door, Adam paused
automatically and looked about for his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hat, quite unconscious
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was or who was present with him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). Mr. Irwine had
followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>), and now took him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) by the arm, saying, in a quiet but
decided tone,
``No, Adam, no; I'm sure you will wish to stay and see what good
can be done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), instead of going on a useless errand of
vengeance. The punishment will surely fall without your aid.
Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) is no longer in Ireland. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) must be on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) way home--
or would be, long before you arrived, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) grandfather, I know,
wrote for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to come at least ten days ago. I want you now to go
with me to Stoniton. I have ordered a horse for you to ride with us,
as soon as you can compose yourself.''
While Mr. Irwine was speaking, Adam recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
consciousness of the actual scene. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hair off his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
forehead and listened.
``Remember,'' Mr. Irwine went on, ``there are others to think of,
and act for, besides yourself, Adam: there are Hetty's friends, the
good Poysers, on whom this stroke will fall more heavily than I can
bear to think. I expect it from your strength of mind, Adam--from
your sense of duty to God and man--that you will try to act as long
as action can be of any use.''
In reality, Mr. Irwine proposed this journey to Stoniton for
Adam's own sake. Movement, with some object before him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), was
the best means of counteracting the violence of suffering in these
first hours.
<div class="bookquote">``You will go with me to Stoniton, Adam?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said again, after a



<p/>540

<p/>moment's pause. <div class="bookquote">``We have to see if it is really Hetty who is there,
you know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, <div class="bookquote">``I'll do what you think right. But the
folks at th' Hall Farm?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wish them not to know till I return to tell them myself. I shall
have ascertained things then which I am uncertain about now, and
I shall return as soon as possible. Come now, the horses are
ready.''

<p/>Chapter XL
The Bitter Waters Spread

<p/>M

<p/>r. Irwine returned from Stoniton in a post-chaise that
night, and the first words Carroll said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carroll</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Carroll</b></font>)
entered the house, were, that Squire Donnithorne was
dead--found dead in his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) bed at ten o’clock that morning--and that
Mrs. Irwine desired him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) should be awake when Mr.
Irwine came home, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) not to go to bed without
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Well, Dauphin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Irwine</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Irwine said, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) son entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) room,
<div class="bookquote">``you're come at last. So the old gentleman's fidgetiness and low
spirits, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Dauphin</b></font>) send for Arthur in that sudden way, really
meant something. I suppose Carroll has told you that Donnithorne
was found dead in his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) bed this morning. You will believe my
prognostications another time, though I daresay I shan't live to
prognosticate anything but my own death.''
 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What have they done about Arthur?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Irwine. <div class="bookquote">``Sent a
messenger to await him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) at Liverpool?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Ralph was gone before the news was brought to us. Dear
Arthur, I shall live now to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) master at the Chase, and
making good times on the estate, like a generous-hearted fellow as
he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'ll be as happy as a king now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div>Mr. Irwine could not help giving a slight groan: he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) was worn
with anxiety and exertion, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) mother's light words were
almost intolerable.
``What are you so dismal about, Dauphin? Is there any bad



<p/>542

<p/>news? Or are you thinking of the danger for Arthur in crossing
that frightful Irish Channel at this time of year?''
``No, Mother, I'm not thinking of that; but I'm not prepared to
rejoice just now.''
``You've been worried by this law business that you've been to
Stoniton about. What in the world is it, that you can't tell me?''
``You will know by-and-by, mother. It would not be right for me
to tell you at present. Good-night: you'll sleep now you have no
longer anything to listen for.''
Mr. Irwine gave up his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) intention of sending a letter to meet
Arthur, since it would not now hasten his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) return: the news of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
grandfather's death would bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could possibly
come. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could go to bed now and get some needful rest, before
the time came for the morning's heavy duty of carrying his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
sickening news to the Hall Farm and to Adam's home.
Adam himself was not come back from Stoniton, for though he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
shrank from seeing Hetty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could not bear to go to a distance
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) again.
``It's no use, sir,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said to the rector, ``it's no use for me to go
back. I can't go to work again while she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s here, and I couldn't bear
the sight o' the things and folks round home. I'll take a bit of a
room here, where I can see the prison walls, and perhaps I shall
get, in time, to bear seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''
Adam had not been shaken in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) belief that Hetty was innocent
of the crime she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was charged with, for Mr. Irwine, feeling that the
belief in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) guilt would be a crushing addition to Adam's load,
had kept from him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) the facts which left no hope in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) own mind.
There was not any reason for thrusting the whole burden on
Adam at once, and Mr. Irwine, at parting, only said, ``If the



<p/>543

<p/>evidence should tell too strongly against her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), Adam, we may still
hope for a pardon. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) youth and other circumstances will be a
plea for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''
``Ah, and it's right people should know how she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was tempted
into the wrong way,'' said Adam, with bitter earnestness. ``It's
right they should know it was a fine gentleman made love to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),
and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head wi' notions. You'll remember, sir, you've
promised to tell my mother, and Seth, and the people at the farm,
who it was as led her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wrong, else they'll think harder of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) than
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) deserves. You'll be doing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a hurt by sparing him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>), and I hold
him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) the guiltiest before God, let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ha' done what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) may. If you
spare him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), I'll expose him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)!''
``I think your demand is just, Adam,'' said Mr. Irwine, <div class="bookquote">``but
when you are calmer, you will judge Arthur more mercifully. I say
nothing now, only that his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) punishment is in other hands than
ours.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Mr. Irwine felt it hard upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) should have to tell of
Arthur's sad part in the story of sin and sorrow--he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) who cared for
Arthur with fatherly affection, who had cared for him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) with fatherly
pride. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) saw clearly that the secret must be known before
long, even apart from Adam's determination, since it was scarcely
to be supposed that Hetty would persist to the end in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) obstinate
silence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mind to withhold nothing from the
Poysers, but to tell them the worst at once, for there was no time
to rob the tidings of their suddenness. Hetty's trial must come on
at the Lent assizes, and they were to be held at Stoniton the next
week. It was scarcely to be hoped that Martin Poyser could escape
the pain of being called as a witness, and it was better he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) should
know everything as long beforehand as possible.



<p/>544

<p/>Before ten o’clock on Thursday morning the home at the Hall
Farm was a house of mourning for a misfortune felt to be worse
than death. The sense of family dishonour was too keen even in
the kind-hearted Martin Poyser the younger to leave room for any
compassion towards Hetty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) father were simple-minded
farmers, proud of their untarnished character, proud that they
came of a family which had held up its head and paid its way as far
back as its name was in the parish register; and Hetty had brought
disgrace on them all--disgrace that could never be wiped out.
That was the all-conquering feeling in the mind both of father and
son--the scorching sense of disgrace, which neutralised all other
sensibility--and Mr. Irwine was struck with surprise to observe
that Mrs. Poyser was less severe than her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) husband. We are often
startled by the severity of mild people on exceptional occasions;
the reason is, that mild people are most liable to be under the yoke
of traditional impressions.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm willing to pay any money as is wanted towards trying to
bring her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin Poyser/Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin the younger when Mr. Irwine was gone,
while the old grandfather was crying in the opposite chair, <div class="bookquote">``but I'll
not go nigh her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), nor ever see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) again, by my own will. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s
made our bread bitter to us for all our lives to come, an' we shall
ne’er hold up our heads i' this parish nor i' any other. The parson
talks o' folks pitying us: it's poor amends pity 'ull make us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the grandfather</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pity?''  (<font color='red'><b>the grandfather</b></font>)</div>said the grandfather, sharply. <div class="bookquote">``I ne’er wanted folks's

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't fret so, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser, who had spoken very

and decision. <div class="bookquote">``You'll have your children wi' you; an' there's the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, there's no staying i' this country for us now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Poyser, and the hard tears trickled slowly down his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) round cheeks.
<div class="bookquote">``We thought it 'ud be bad luck if the old squire gave us notice this
Lady Day, but I must gi' notice myself now, an' see if there can

 (<font color='red'><b>Alick</b></font>)</div>Alick came now with the message, and Seth, finding that Mrs.
Poyser was writing to Dinah, gave up the intention of writing
himself; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) went to the Hall Farm to tell them all he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) could
suggest about the address of the letter, and warn them that there
might be some delay in the delivery, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) not knowing an
exact direction.
On leaving Lisbeth, Mr. Irwine had gone to Jonathan Burge,
who had also a claim to be acquainted with what was likely to keep
Adam away from business for some time; and before six o’clock
that evening there were few people in Broxton and Hayslope who
had not heard the sad news. Mr. Irwine had not mentioned
Arthur's name to Burge, and yet the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) conduct towards
Hetty, with all the dark shadows cast upon it by its terrible
consequences, was presently as well known as that his (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>)
grandfather was dead, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) was come into the estate. For



<p/>548

<p/>Martin Poyser felt no motive to keep silence towards the one or
two neighbours who ventured to come and shake him (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) sorrowfully
by the hand on the first day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) trouble; and Carroll, who kept
his (<font color='blue'><b>Carroll</b></font>) ears open to all that passed at the rectory, had framed an
inferential version of the story, and found early opportunities of
communicating it.
One of those neighbours who came to Martin Poyser and shook
him (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) by the hand without speaking for some minutes was Bartle
Massey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) had shut up his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) school, and was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) way to the
rectory, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) arrived about half-past seven in the evening,
and, sending his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) duty to Mr. Irwine, begged pardon for troubling
him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) at that hour, but had something particular on his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
was shown into the study, where Mr. Irwine soon joined him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Well, Bartle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Irwine, putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) hand. That was
not his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) usual way of saluting the schoolmaster, but trouble makes
us treat all who feel with us very much alike. <div class="bookquote">``Sit down.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You know what I'm come about as well as I do, sir, I daresay,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div>said Bartle.
<div class="bookquote">``You wish to know the truth about the sad news that has
reached you ... about Hetty Sorrel?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Nay, sir, what I wish to know is about Adam Bede. I
understand you left him (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) at Stoniton, and I beg the favour of you to
tell me what's the state of the poor lad's mind, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) means
to do. For as for that bit o' pink-and-white they've taken the
trouble to put in jail, I don't value her (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>) a rotten nut--not a rotten
nut--only for the harm or good that may come out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>) to an
honest man--a lad I've set such store by--trusted to, that he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'d
make my bit o' knowledge go a good way in the world ... Why, sir,
he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'s the only scholar I've had in this stupid country that ever had



<p/>549

<p/>the will or the head-piece for mathematics. If he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) hadn't had so
much hard work to do, poor fellow, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) might have gone into the
higher branches, and then this might never have happened--
might never have happened.''
Bartle was heated by the exertion of walking fast in an agitated
frame of mind, and was not able to check himself on this first
occasion of venting his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) feelings. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) paused now to rub his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>)
moist forehead, and probably his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) moist eyes also.
``You'll excuse me, sir,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) said, when this pause had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>)
time to reflect, ``for running on in this way about my own feelings,
like that foolish dog of mine howling in a storm, when there's
nobody wants to listen to me. I came to hear you speak, not to talk
myself--if you'll take the trouble to tell me what the poor lad's
doing.''
``Don't put yourself under any restraint, Bartle,'' said Mr.
Irwine. ``The fact is, I'm very much in the same condition as you
just now; I've a great deal that's painful on my mind, and I find it
hard work to be quite silent about my own feelings and only
attend to others. I share your concern for Adam, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) is not
the only one whose sufferings I care for in this affair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) intends to
remain at Stoniton till after the trial: it will come on probably a
week to-morrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) has taken a room there, and I encouraged
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to do so, because I think it better he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) should be away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
own home at present; and, poor fellow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) still believes Hetty is
innocent--he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) wants to summon up courage to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) can; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
is unwilling to leave the spot where she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) is.''
``Do you think the creatur's guilty, then?'' said Bartle. ``Do you
think they'll hang her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)?''
``I'm afraid it will go hard with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). The evidence is very strong.



<p/>550

<p/>And one bad symptom is that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) denies everything--denies that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) has had a child in the face of the most positive evidence. I saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) myself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was obstinately silent to me; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) shrank up
like a frightened animal when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) saw me. I was never so shocked
in my life as at the change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). But I trust that, in the worst
case, we may obtain a pardon for the sake of the innocent who are
involved.''
``Stuff and nonsense!'' said Bartle, forgetting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) irritation to
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) was speaking. ``I beg your pardon, sir, I mean it's stuff
and nonsense for the innocent to care about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) being hanged. For
my own part, I think the sooner such women are put out o' the
world the better; and the men that help ’em to do mischief had
better go along with ’em for that matter. What good will you do by
keeping such vermin alive, eating the victual that 'ud feed rational
beings? But if Adam's fool enough to care about it, I don't want
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to suffer more than's needful ... Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) very much cut up, poor
fellow?'' Bartle added, taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) spectacles and putting them
on, as if they would assist his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) imagination.
``Yes, I'm afraid the grief cuts very deep,'' said Mr. Irwine. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
looks terribly shattered, and a certain violence came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) now
and then yesterday, which made me wish I could have remained
near him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). But I shall go to Stoniton again to-morrow, and I have
confidence enough in the strength of Adam's principle to trust that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) will be able to endure the worst without being driven to
anything rash.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Mr. Irwine, who was involuntarily uttering his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) own thoughts
rather than addressing Bartle Massey in the last sentence, had in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) mind the possibility that the spirit of vengeance to-wards
Arthur, which was the form Adam's anguish was continually



<p/>551

<p/>taking, might make him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) seek an encounter that was likely to end
more fatally than the one in the Grove. This possibility heightened
the anxiety with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) looked forward to Arthur's arrival. But
Bartle thought Mr. Irwine was referring to suicide, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) face
wore a new alarm.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what I have in my head, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and I hope
you'll approve of it. I'm going to shut up my school--if the scholars
come, they must go back again, that's all--and I shall go to
Stoniton and look after Adam till this business is over. I'll pretend
I'm come to look on at the assizes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) can't object to that. What do
you think about it, sir?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Irwine, rather hesitatingly, <div class="bookquote">``there would be
some real advantages in that ... and I honour you for your
friendship towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), Bartle. But ... you must be careful what
you say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), you know. I'm afraid you have too little fellowfeeling in what you consider his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) weakness about Hetty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Trust to me, sir--trust to me. I know what you mean. I've been
a fool myself in my time, but that's between you and me. I shan't
thrust myself on him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) only keep my eye on him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), and see that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
gets some good food, and put in a word here and there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Irwine, reassured a little as to Bartle's
discretion, <div class="bookquote">``I think you'll be doing a good deed; and it will be well
for you to let Adam's mother and brother know that you're going.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div>said Bartle, rising, and taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) spectacles,
``I'll do that, I'll do that; though the mother's a whimpering thing--
I don't like to come within earshot of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); however, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s a
straight-backed, clean woman, none of your slatterns. I wish you
good-bye, sir, and thank you for the time you've spared me. You're
everybody's friend in this business--everybody's friend. It's a



<p/>552

<p/>heavy weight you've got on your shoulders.''
``Good-bye, Bartle, till we meet at Stoniton, as I daresay we
shall.''
Bartle hurried away from the rectory, evading Carroll's
conversational advances, and saying in an exasperated tone to
Vixen, whose short legs pattered beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) on the gravel, <div class="bookquote">``Now, I
shall be obliged to take you with me, you good-for-nothing woman.
You'd go fretting yourself to death if I left you--you know you
would, and perhaps get snapped up by some tramp. And you'll be
running into bad company, I expect, putting your nose in every
hole and corner where you've no business! But if you do anything
disgraceful, I'll disown you--mind that, madam, mind that!''

<p/>Chapter XLI
The Eve of the Trial

<p/>A

<p/>n upper room in a dull Stoniton street, with two beds in
it--one laid on the floor. It is ten o’clock on Thursday
night, and the dark wall opposite the window shuts out
the moonlight that might have struggled with the light of the one
dip candle by which Bartle Massey is pretending to read, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>)
is really looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) spectacles at Adam Bede, seated near the
dark window.
You would hardly have known it was Adam without being told.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) face has got thinner this last week: he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) has the sunken eyes, the
neglected beard of a man just risen from a sick-bed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) heavy
black hair hangs over his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) forehead, and there is no active impulse
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) which inclines him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to push it off, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) may be more
awake to what is around him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) has one arm over the back of the
chair, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) seems to be looking down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) clasped hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) is
roused by a knock at the door.
<div class="bookquote">``There he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div>said Bartle Massey, rising hastily and
unfastening the door. It was Mr. Irwine.
Adam rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) chair with instinctive respect, as Mr. Irwine
approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm late, Adam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) said, sitting down on the chair which
Bartle placed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but I was later in setting off from Broxton
than I intended to be, and I have been incessantly occupied since I
arrived. I have done everything now, however--everything that
can be done to-night, at least. Let us all sit down.''




 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>554

<p/>Adam took his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) chair again mechanically, and Bartle, for whom
there was no chair remaining, sat on the bed in the background.
<div class="bookquote">``Have you seen her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>), sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam tremulously.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, Adam; I and the chaplain have both been with her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) this
evening.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did you ask her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>), sir ... did you say anything about me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Irwine, with some hesitation, <div class="bookquote">``I spoke of you. I
said you wished to see her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) before the trial, if she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) consented.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div>As Mr. Irwine paused, Adam looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) with eager,
questioning eyes.
``You know she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) shrinks from seeing any one, Adam. It is not
only you--some fatal influence seems to have shut up her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) heart
against her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) fellow-creatures. She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) has scarcely said anything more
than `No' either to me or the chaplain. Three or four days ago,
before you were mentioned to her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>), when I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) if there was
any one of her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) family whom she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) would like to see--to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)
could open her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) mind--she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) said, with a violent shudder, `Tell them
not to come near me--I won't see any of them.'''
Adam's head was hanging down again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) did not speak.
There was silence for a few minutes, and then Mr. Irwine said, ``I
don't like to advise you against your own feelings, Adam, if they
now urge you strongly to go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) to-morrow morning, even
without her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) consent. It is just possible, notwithstanding
appearances to the contrary, that the interview might affect her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)
favourably. But I grieve to say I have scarcely any hope of that.
She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) didn't seem agitated when I mentioned your name; she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) only
said `No,' in the same cold, obstinate way as usual. And if the
meeting had no good effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>), it would be pure, useless
suffering to you--severe suffering, I fear. She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) is very much



<p/>555

<p/>changed ... ''
Adam started up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) chair and seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hat, which lay on
the table. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) stood still then, and looked at Mr. Irwine, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
had a question to ask which it was yet difficult to utter. Bartle
Massey rose quietly, turned the key in the door, and put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>)
pocket.
``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) come back?'' said Adam at last.
``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) is not,'' said Mr. Irwine, quietly. ``Lay down your hat,
Adam, unless you like to walk out with me for a little fresh air. I
fear you have not been out again to-day.''
``You needn't deceive me, sir,'' said Adam, looking hard at Mr.
Irwine and speaking in a tone of angry suspicion. ``You needn't be
afraid of me. I only want justice. I want him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to feel what she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) feels.
It's his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) work ... she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) was a child as it 'ud ha' gone t' anybody's
heart to look at ... I don't care what she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)'s done ... it was him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
brought her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) to it. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) shall know it ... he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) shall feel it ... if
there's a just God, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shall feel what it is t' ha' brought a child like
her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) to sin and misery.''
``I'm not deceiving you, Adam,'' said Mr. Irwine. ``Arthur
Donnithorne is not come back--was not come back when I left. I
have left a letter for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) will know all as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) arrives.''
``But you don't mind about it,'' said Adam indignantly. ``You
think it doesn't matter as she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) lies there in shame and misery, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) knows nothing about it--he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) suffers nothing.''
``Adam, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) will know--he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) will suffer, long and bitterly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) has a
heart and a conscience: I can't be entirely deceived in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
character. I am convinced--I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) didn't fall under
temptation without a struggle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) may be weak, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) is not
callous, not coldly selfish. I am persuaded that this will be a shock



<p/>556

<p/>of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) will feel the effects all his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) life. Why do you crave
vengeance in this way? No amount of torture that you could inflict
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could benefit her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>).''
``No--O God, no,'' Adam groaned out, sinking on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) chair
again; ``but then, that's the deepest curse of all ... that's what
makes the blackness of it ... it can never be undone. My poor Hetty
... she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) can never be my sweet Hetty again ... the prettiest thing
God had made--smiling up at me ... I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) loved me ...
and was good ... ''
Adam's voice had been gradually sinking into a hoarse
undertone, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) were only talking to himself; but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said
abruptly, looking at Mr. Irwine, ``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) isn't as guilty as they
say? You don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) is, sir? She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) can't ha' done it.''
``That perhaps can never be known with certainty, Adam,'' Mr.
Irwine answered gently. ``In these cases we sometimes form our
judgment on what seems to us strong evidence, and yet, for want
of knowing some small fact, our judgment is wrong. But suppose
the worst: you have no right to say that the guilt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) crime lies
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) ought to bear the punishment. It is not for us
men to apportion the shares of moral guilt and retribution. We
find it impossible to avoid mistakes even in determining who has
committed a single criminal act, and the problem how far a man is
to be held responsible for the unforeseen consequences of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
deed is one that might well make us tremble to look into it. The
evil consequences that may lie folded in a single act of selfish
indulgence is a thought so awful that it ought surely to awaken
some feeling less presumptuous than a rash desire to punish. You
have a mind that can understand this fully, Adam, when you are
calm. Don't suppose I can't enter into the anguish that drives you



<p/>557

<p/>into this state of revengeful hatred. But think of this: if you were to
obey your passion--for it is passion, and you deceive yourself in
calling it justice--it might be with you precisely as it has been with
Arthur; nay, worse; your passion might lead you yourself into a
horrible crime.''
``No--not worse,'' said Adam, bitterly; ``I don't believe it's
worse--I'd sooner do it--I'd sooner do a wickedness as I could
suffer for by myself than ha' brought her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to do wickedness and
then stand by and see ’em punish her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) while they let me alone; and
all for a bit o' pleasure, as, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)'d had a man's heart in him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)'d
ha' cut his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hand off sooner than he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)'d ha' taken it. What if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) didn't
foresee what's happened? He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) foresaw enough; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)'d no right to
expect anything but harm and shame to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) wanted
to smooth it off wi' lies. No--there's plenty o' things folks are
hanged for not half so hateful as that. Let a man do what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will, if
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s to bear the punishment himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) isn't half so bad
as a mean selfish coward as makes things easy t' himself and
knows all the while the punishment 'll fall on somebody else.''
``There again you partly deceive yourself, Adam. There is no
sort of wrong deed of which a man can bear the punishment alone;
you can't isolate yourself and say that the evil which is in you shall
not spread. Men's lives are as thoroughly blended with each other
as the air they breathe: evil spreads as necessarily as disease. I
know, I feel the terrible extent of suffering this sin of Arthur's has
caused to others; but so does every sin cause suffering to others
besides those who commit it. An act of vengeance on your part
against Arthur would simply be another evil added to those we are
suffering under: you could not bear the punishment alone; you
would entail the worst sorrows on every one who loves you. You



<p/>558

<p/>would have committed an act of blind fury that would leave all the
present evils just as they were and add worse evils to them. You
may tell me that you meditate no fatal act of vengeance, but the
feeling in your mind is what gives birth to such actions, and as
long as you indulge it, as long as you do not see that to fix your
mind on Arthur's punishment is revenge, and not justice, you are
in danger of being led on to the commission of some great wrong.
Remember what you told me about your feelings after you had
given that blow to Arthur in the Grove.''
Adam was silent: the last words had called up a vivid image of
the past, and Mr. Irwine left him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) thoughts, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) spoke to
Bartle Massey about old Mr. Donnithorne's funeral and other
matters of an indifferent kind. But at length Adam turned round
and said, in a more subdued tone, ``I've not asked about ’em at th'
Hall Farm, sir. Is Mr. Poyser coming?''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) is come; he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) is in Stoniton to-night. But I could not advise
him (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) to see you, Adam. His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) own mind is in a very perturbed state,
and it is best he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) should not see you till you are calmer.''
``Is Dinah Morris come to ’em, sir? Seth said they'd sent for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>).''
``No. Mr. Poyser tells me she (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was not come when he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) left.
They're afraid the letter has not reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>). It seems they had no
exact address.''
Adam sat ruminating a little while, and then said, ``I wonder if
Dinah 'ud ha' gone to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). But perhaps the Poysers would ha'
been sorely against it, since they won't come nigh her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) themselves.
But I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would, for the Methodists are great folks for going
into the prisons; and Seth said he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'d a very
tender way with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), Dinah had; I wonder if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) could ha' done



<p/>559

<p/>any good. You never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), sir, did you?''
``Yes, I did. I had a conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) pleased me a
good deal. And now you mention it, I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would come, for it is
possible that a gentle mild woman like her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might move Hetty to
open her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart. The jail chaplain is rather harsh in his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) manner.''
``But it's o' no use if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) doesn't come,'' said Adam sadly.
``If I'd thought of it earlier, I would have taken some measures
for finding her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) out,'' said Mr. Irwine, <div class="bookquote">``but it's too late now, I fear . .
. Well, Adam, I must go now. Try to get some rest to-night. God
bless you. I'll see you early to-morrow morning.''

<p/>Chapter XLII
The Morning of the Trial

<p/>A

<p/>t one o’clock the next day, Adam was alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) dull
upper room; his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) watch lay before him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) on the table, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
were counting the long minutes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had no knowledge of
what was likely to be said by the witnesses on the trial, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had
shrunk from all the particulars connected with Hetty's arrest and
accusation. This brave active man, who would have hastened
towards any danger or toil to rescue Hetty from an apprehended
wrong or misfortune, felt himself powerless to contemplate
irremediable evil and suffering. The susceptibility which would
have been an impelling force where there was any possibility of
action became helpless anguish when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was obliged to be
passive, or else sought an active outlet in the thought of inflicting
justice on Arthur. Energetic natures, strong for all strenuous
deeds, will often rush away from a hopeless sufferer, as if they
were hard-hearted. It is the overmastering sense of pain that
drives them. They shrink by an ungovernable instinct, as they
would shrink from laceration. Adam had brought himself to think
of seeing Hetty, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would consent to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
thought the meeting might possibly be a good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)--might help
to melt away this terrible hardness they told him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) of. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) no ill will for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had done to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) might open
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heart to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). But this resolution had been an immense effort--
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) trembled at the thought of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) changed face, as a timid
woman trembles at the thought of the surgeon's knife, and he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>)




<p/>561

<p/>chose now to bear the long hours of suspense rather than
encounter what seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) the more intolerable agony of
witnessing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) trial.
Deep unspeakable suffering may well be called a baptism, a
regeneration, the initiation into a new state. The yearning
memories, the bitter regret, the agonised sympathy, the struggling
appeals to the Invisible Right--all the intense emotions which had
filled the days and nights of the past week, and were compressing
themselves again like an eager crowd into the hours of this single
morning, made Adam look back on all the previous years as if they
had been a dim sleepy existence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had only now awaked to
full consciousness. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had always before
thought it a light thing that men should suffer, as if all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had
himself endured and called sorrow before was only a moment's
stroke that had never left a bruise. Doubtless a great anguish may
do the work of years, and we may come out from that baptism of
fire with a soul full of new awe and new pity.
<div class="bookquote">``O God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam groaned, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) leaned on the table and looked
blankly at the face of the watch, <div class="bookquote">``and men have suffered like this
before ... and poor helpless young things have suffered like her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) . .
. Such a little while ago looking so happy and so pretty ... kissing
’em all, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grandfather and all of ’em, and they wishing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) luck .
. . O my poor, poor Hetty ... dost think on it now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Adam started and looked round towards the door. Vixen had
begun to whimper, and there was a sound of a stick and a lame
walk on the stairs. It was Bartle Massey come back. Could it be all
over?
Bartle entered quietly, and, going up to Adam, grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
hand and said, ``I'm just come to look at you, my boy, for the folks



<p/>562

<p/>are gone out of court for a bit.''
Adam's heart beat so violently he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was unable to speak--he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
could only return the pressure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) friend's hand--and Bartle,
drawing up the other chair, came and sat in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>), taking off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) hat and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) spectacles.
``That's a thing never happened to me before,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) observed, ``to
go out o' the door with my spectacles on. I clean forgot to take ’em
off.''
The old man made this trivial remark, thinking it better not to
respond at all to Adam's agitation: he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would gather, in an indirect
way, that there was nothing decisive to communicate at present.
``And now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, rising again, ``I must see to your having a
bit of the loaf, and some of that wine Mr. Irwine sent this morning.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)'ll be angry with me if you don't have it. Come, now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) went
on, bringing forward the bottle and the loaf and pouring some
wine into a cup, ``I must have a bit and a sup myself. Drink a drop
with me, my lad--drink with me.''
Adam pushed the cup gently away and said, entreatingly, ``Tell
me about it, Mr. Massey--tell me all about it. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) there? Have
they begun?''
``Yes, my boy, yes--it's taken all the time since I first went; but
they're slow, they're slow; and there's the counsel they've got for
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) puts a spoke in the wheel whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) can, and makes a deal
to do with cross-examining the witnesses and quarrelling with the
other lawyers. That's all he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) can do for the money they give him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>);
and it's a big sum--it's a big sum. But he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>)'s a 'cute fellow, with an
eye that 'ud pick the needles out of the hay in no time. If a man
had got no feelings, it 'ud be as good as a demonstration to listen
to what goes on in court; but a tender heart makes one stupid. I'd



<p/>563

<p/>have given up figures for ever only to have had some good news to
bring to you, my poor lad.''
``But does it seem to be going against her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)?'' said Adam. ``Tell
me what they've said. I must know it now--I must know what they
have to bring against her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).''
``Why, the chief evidence yet has been the doctors; all but
Martin Poyser--poor Martin. Everybody in court felt for him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)--it
was like one sob, the sound they made when he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) came down again.
The worst was when they told him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) to look at the prisoner at the
bar. It was hard work, poor fellow--it was hard work. Adam, my
boy, the blow falls heavily on him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) as well as you; you must help
poor Martin; you must show courage. Drink some wine now, and
show me you mean to bear it like a man.''
Bartle had made the right sort of appeal. Adam, with an air of
quiet obedience, took up the cup and drank a little.
``Tell me how she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) looked,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said presently.
``Frightened, very frightened, when they first brought her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) in; it
was the first sight of the crowd and the judge, poor creatur. And
there's a lot o' foolish women in fine clothes, with gewgaws all up
their arms and feathers on their heads, sitting near the judge:
they've dressed themselves out in that way, one 'ud think, to be
scarecrows and warnings against any man ever meddling with a
woman again. They put up their glasses, and stared and
whispered. But after that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood like a white image, staring
down at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands and seeming neither to hear nor see anything.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s as white as a sheet. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) didn't speak when they asked
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d plead `guilty' or `not guilty,' and they pleaded `not
guilty' for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). But when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) uncle's name, there
seemed to go a shiver right through her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and when they told him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)



<p/>564

<p/>to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hung her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head down, and cowered, and hid her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
face in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)'d much ado to speak poor man, his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) voice
trembled so. And the counsellors--who look as hard as nails
mostly--I saw, spared him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) as much as they could. Mr. Irwine put
himself near him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) and went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) out o' court. Ah, it's a great
thing in a man's life to be able to stand by a neighbour and uphold
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in such trouble as that.''
``God bless him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and you too, Mr. Massey,'' said Adam, in a low
voice, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hand on Bartle's arm.
``Aye, aye, he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>)'s good metal; he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) gives the right ring when you try
him (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>), our parson does. A man o' sense--says no more than's
needful. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s not one of those that think they can comfort you with
chattering, as if folks who stand by and look on knew a deal better
what the trouble was than those who have to bear it. I've had to do
with such folks in my time--in the south, when I was in trouble
myself. Mr. Irwine is to be a witness himself, by-and-by, on her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
side, you know, to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) character and bringing up.''
``But the other evidence ... does it go hard against her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)!'' said
Adam. ``What do you think, Mr. Massey? Tell me the truth.''
``Yes, my lad, yes. The truth is the best thing to tell. It must
come at last. The doctors' evidence is heavy on her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)--is heavy. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'s gone on denying she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'s had a child from first to last. These
poor silly women-things--they've not the sense to know it's no use
denying what's proved. It'll make against her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) with the jury, I
doubt, her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) being so obstinate: they may be less for recommending
her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) to mercy, if the verdict's against her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>). But Mr. Irwine 'ull leave
no stone unturned with the judge--you may rely upon that,
Adam.''
``Is there nobody to stand by her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) and seem to care for her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) in the



<p/>565

<p/>court?'' said Adam.
``There's the chaplain o' the jail sits near her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>)'s a sharp
ferrety-faced man--another sort o' flesh and blood to Mr. Irwine.
They say the jail chaplains are mostly the fag-end o' the clergy.''
``There's one man as ought to be there,'' said Adam bitterly.
Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) drew himself up and looked fixedly out of the
window, apparently turning over some new idea in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mind.
``Mr. Massey,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said at last, pushing the hair off his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) forehead,
``I'll go back with you. I'll go into court. It's cowardly of me to keep
away. I'll stand by her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)--I'll own her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)--for all she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'s been deceitful.
They oughtn't to cast her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) off--her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) own flesh and blood. We hand
folks over to God's mercy, and show none ourselves. I used to be
hard sometimes: I'll never be hard again. I'll go, Mr. Massey--I'll
go with you.''
There was a decision in Adam's manner which would have
prevented Bartle from opposing him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had wished to do
so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) only said, <div class="bookquote">``Take a bit, then, and another sup, Adam, for the
love of me. See, I must stop and eat a morsel. Now, you take
some.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Nerved by an active resolution, Adam took a morsel of bread
and drank some wine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was haggard and unshaven, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had
been yesterday, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) stood upright again, and looked more like
the Adam Bede of former days.




<p/>566

<p/>Chapter XLIII
The Verdict

<p/>T

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) place fitted up that day as a court of justice was a grand
old hall, now destroyed by fire. The midday light that fell
on the close pavement of human heads was shed through
a line of high pointed windows, variegated with the mellow tints of
old painted glass. Grim dusty armour hung in high relief in front
of the dark oaken gallery at the farther end, and under the broad
arch of the great mullioned window opposite was spread a curtain
of old tapestry, covered with dim melancholy figures, like a dozing
indistinct dream of the past. It was a place that through the rest of
the year was haunted with the shadowy memories of old kings and
queens, unhappy, discrowned, imprisoned; but to-day all those
shadows had fled, and not a soul in the vast hall felt the presence
of any but a living sorrow, which was quivering in warm hearts.
But that sorrow seemed to have made it itself feebly felt
hitherto, now when Adam Bede's tall figure was suddenly seen
being ushered to the side of the prisoner's dock. In the broad
sunlight of the great hall, among the sleek shaven faces of other
men, the marks of suffering in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) face were startling even to Mr.
Irwine, who had last seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) in the dim light of his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) small room;
and the neighbours from Hayslope who were present, and who
told Hetty Sorrel's story by their firesides in their old age, never
forgot to say how it moved them when Adam Bede, poor fellow,
taller by the head than most of the people round him (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>), came into
court and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) place by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>) side.




<p/>567

<p/>But Hetty did not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was standing in the same
position Bartle Massey had described, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hands crossed over
each other and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eyes fixed on them. Adam had not dared to
look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) in the first moments, but at last, when the attention of
the court was withdrawn by the proceedings he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) face
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) with a resolution not to shrink.
Why did they say she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was so changed? In the corpse we love, it
is the likeness we see--it is the likeness, which makes itself felt the
more keenly because something else was and is not. There they
were--the sweet face and neck, with the dark tendrils of hair, the
long dark lashes, the rounded cheek and the pouting lips--pale
and thin, yes, but like Hetty, and only Hetty. Others thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
looked as if some demon had cast a blighting glance upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>),
withered up the woman's soul in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), and left only a hard
despairing obstinacy. But the mother's yearning, that completest
type of the life in another life which is the essence of real human
love, feels the presence of the cherished child even in the debased,
degraded man; and to Adam, this pale, hard-looking culprit was
the Hetty who had smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) in the garden under the appletree boughs--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was that Hetty's corpse, which he (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) had trembled
to look at the first time, and then was unwilling to turn away his (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>)
eyes from.
But presently he (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) heard something that compelled him (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) to listen,
and made the sense of sight less absorbing. A woman was in the
witness-box, a middle-aged woman, who spoke in a firm distinct
voice. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said,
``My name is Sarah Stone. I am a widow, and keep a small shop
licensed to sell tobacco, snuff, and tea in Church Lane, Stoniton.
The prisoner at the bar is the same young woman who came,



<p/>568

<p/>looking ill and tired, with a basket on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arm, and asked for a
lodging at my house on Saturday evening, the 27th of February.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had taken the house for a public, because there was a figure
against the door. And when I said I didn't take in lodgers, the
prisoner began to cry, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was too tired to go anywhere
else, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only wanted a bed for one night. And her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) prettiness,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) condition, and something respectable about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) clothes
and looks, and the trouble she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seemed to be in made me as I
couldn't find in my heart to send her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) away at once. I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to
sit down, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) some tea, and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
going, and where her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) friends were. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was going home
to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) friends: they were farming folks a good way off, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d
had a long journey that had cost her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) more money than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
expected, so as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d hardly any money left in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pocket, and was
afraid of going where it would cost her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) much. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been
obliged to sell most of the things out of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) basket, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d
thankfully give a shilling for a bed. I saw no reason why I shouldn't
take the young woman in for the night. I had only one room, but
there were two beds in it, and I told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might stay with me. I
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d been led wrong, and got into trouble, but if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
going to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) friends, it would be a good work to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) out of
further harm.''
The witness then stated that in the night a child was born, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) identified the baby-clothes then shown to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as those in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had herself dressed the child.
``Those are the clothes. I made them myself, and had kept them
by me ever since my last child was born. I took a deal of trouble
both for the child and the mother. I couldn't help taking to the
little thing and being anxious about it. I didn't send for a doctor,



<p/>569

<p/>for there seemed no need. I told the mother in the day-time she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
must tell me the name of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) friends, and where they lived, and let
me write to them. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, by and by she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would write herself, but
not to-day. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would have no nay, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would get up and be
dressed, in spite of everything I could say. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt quite
strong enough; and it was wonderful what spirit she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) showed. But I
wasn't quite easy what I should do about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and towards evening
I made up my mind I'd go, after Meeting was over, and speak to
our minister about it. I left the house about half-past eight o’clock.
I didn't go out at the shop door, but at the back door, which opens
into a narrow alley. I've only got the ground-floor of the house, and
the kitchen and bedroom both look into the alley. I left the
prisoner sitting up by the fire in the kitchen with the baby on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
lap. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hadn't cried or seemed low at all, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did the night
before. I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had a strange look with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) got
a bit flushed towards evening. I was afraid of the fever, and I
thought I'd call and ask an acquaintance of mine, an experienced
woman, to come back with me when I went out. It was a very dark
night. I didn't fasten the door behind me; there was no lock; it was
a latch with a bolt inside, and when there was nobody in the house
I always went out at the shop door. But I thought there was no
danger in leaving it unfastened that little while. I was longer than I
meant to be, for I had to wait for the woman that came back with
me. It was an hour and a half before we got back, and when we
went in, the candle was standing burning just as I left it, but the
prisoner and the baby were both gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d taken her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cloak and
bonnet, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d left the basket and the things in it ... I was
dreadful frightened, and angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for going. I didn't go to
give information, because I'd no thought she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) meant to do any



<p/>570

<p/>harm, and I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had money in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pocket to buy her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) food
and lodging. I didn't like to set the constable after her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d a
right to go from me if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) liked.''
The effect of this evidence on Adam was electrical; it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
new force. Hetty could not be guilty of the crime--her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heart must
have clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) baby--else why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) have taken it with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) might have left it behind. The little creature had died
naturally, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had hidden it. Babies were so liable to
death--and there might be the strongest suspicions without any
proof of guilt. His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mind was so occupied with imaginary
arguments against such suspicions, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could not listen to the
cross-examination by Hetty's counsel, who tried, without result, to
elicit evidence that the prisoner had shown some movements of
maternal affection towards the child. The whole time this witness
was being examined, Hetty had stood as motionless as before: no
word seemed to arrest her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) ear. But the sound of the next witness's
voice touched a chord that was still sensitive, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) gave a start and
a frightened look towards him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>), but immediately turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
head and looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hands as before. This witness was a
man, a rough peasant. He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) said:
<div class="bookquote">``My name is John Olding. I am a labourer, and live at Tedd's
Hole, two miles out of Stoniton. A week last Monday, towards one
o’clock in the afternoon, I was going towards Hetton Coppice, and
about a quarter of a mile from the coppice I saw the prisoner, in a
red cloak, sitting under a bit of a haystack not far off the stile. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
got up when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw me, and seemed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d be walking on the
other way. It was a regular road through the fields, and nothing
very uncommon to see a young woman there, but I took notice of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked white and scared. I should have thought



<p/>571

<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a beggar-woman, only for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) good clothes. I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
looked a bit crazy, but it was no business of mine. I stood and
looked back after her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went right on while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was in sight.
I had to go to the other side of the coppice to look after some
stakes. There's a road right through it, and bits of openings here
and there, where the trees have been cut down, and some of ’em
not carried away. I didn't go straight along the road, but turned off
towards the middle, and took a shorter way towards the spot I
wanted to get to. I hadn't got far out of the road into one of the
open places before I heard a strange cry. I thought it didn't come
from any animal I knew, but I wasn't for stopping to look about
just then. But it went on, and seemed so strange to me in that
place, I couldn't help stopping to look. I began to think I might
make some money of it, if it was a new thing. But I had hard work
to tell which way it came from, and for a good while I kept looking
up at the boughs. And then I thought it came from the ground; and
there was a lot of timber-choppings lying about, and loose pieces
of turf, and a trunk or two. And I looked about among them, but
could find nothing, and at last the cry stopped. So I was for giving
it up, and I went on about my business. But when I came back the
same way pretty nigh an hour after, I couldn't help laying down
my stakes to have another look. And just as I was stooping and
laying down the stakes, I saw something odd and round and
whitish lying on the ground under a nut-bush by the side of me.
And I stooped down on hands and knees to pick it up. And I saw it
was a little baby's hand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>At these words a thrill ran through the court. Hetty was visibly
trembling; now, for the first time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) seemed to be listening to
what a witness said.



<p/>572

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was a lot of timber-choppings put together just where
the ground went hollow, like, under the bush, and the hand came
out from among them. But there was a hole left in one place and I
could see down it and see the child's head; and I made haste and
did away the turf and the choppings, and took out the child. It had
got comfortable clothes on, but its body was cold, and I thought it
must be dead. I made haste back with it out of the wood, and took
it home to my wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said it was dead, and I'd better take it to
the parish and tell the constable. And I said, `I'll lay my life it's that
young woman's child as I met going to the coppice.' But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
seemed to be gone clean out of sight. And I took the child on to
Hetton parish and told the constable, and we went on to Justice
Hardy. And then we went looking after the young woman till dark
at night, and we went and gave information at Stoniton, as they
might stop her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). And the next morning, another constable came to
me, to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) to the spot where I found the child. And when
we got there, there was the prisoner a-sitting against the bush
where I found the child; and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried out when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw us, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) never offered to move. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d got a big piece of bread on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
lap.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam had given a faint groan of despair while this witness was
speaking. He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had hidden his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) face on his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) arm, which rested on the
boarding in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>). It was the supreme moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>)
suffering: Hetty was guilty; and he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was silently calling to God for
help. He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) heard no more of the evidence, and was unconscious
when the case for the prosecution had closed--unconscious that
Mr. Irwine was in the witness-box, telling of Hetty's unblemished
character in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) own parish and of the virtuous habits in which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had been brought up. This testimony could have no influence



<p/>573

<p/>on the verdict, but it was given as part of that plea for mercy which
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) own counsel would have made if he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) had been allowed to speak
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)--a favour not granted to criminals in those stern times.
At last Adam lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) head, for there was a general
movement round him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). The judge had addressed the jury, and they
were retiring. The decisive moment was not far off Adam felt a
shuddering horror that would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) look at Hetty, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
had long relapsed into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) blank hard indifference. All eyes were
strained to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) stood like a statue of dull despair.
There was a mingled rustling, whispering, and low buzzing
throughout the court during this interval. The desire to listen was
suspended, and every one had some feeling or opinion to express
in undertones. Adam sat looking blankly before him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) did
not see the objects that were right in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) eyes--the counsel
and attorneys talking with an air of cool business, and Mr. Irwine
in low earnest conversation with the judge--did not see Mr. Irwine
sit down again in agitation and shake his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) head mournfully when
somebody whispered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>). The inward action was too intense
for Adam to take in outward objects until some strong sensation
roused him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>).
It was not very long, hardly more than a quarter of an hour,
before the knock which told that the jury had come to their
decision fell as a signal for silence on every ear. It is sublime--that
sudden pause of a great multitude which tells that one soul moves
in them all. Deeper and deeper the silence seemed to become, like
the deepening night, while the jurymen's names were called over,
and the prisoner was made to hold up her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) hand, and the jury were
asked for their verdict.
<div class="bookquote">``Guilty.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>574

<p/>It was the verdict every one expected, but there was a sigh of
disappointment from some hearts that it was followed by no
recommendation to mercy. Still the sympathy of the court was not
with the prisoner. The unnaturalness of her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) crime stood out the
more harshly by the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) hard immovability and obstinate
silence. Even the verdict, to distant eyes, had not appeared to
move her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), but those who were near saw her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) trembling.
The stillness was less intense until the judge put on his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) black
cap, and the chaplain in his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) canonicals was observed behind him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>).
Then it deepened again, before the crier had had time to
command silence. If any sound were heard, it must have been the
sound of beating hearts. The judge spoke,
<div class="bookquote">``Hester Sorrel ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>The judge</b></font>)</div>The blood rushed to Hetty's face, and then fled back again as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) looked up at the judge and kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) wide-open eyes fixed on
him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>), as if fascinated by fear. Adam had not yet turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>),
there was a deep horror, like a great gulf, between them. But at
the words <div class="bookquote">``and then to be hanged by the neck till you be dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>a
piercing shriek rang through the hall. It was Hetty's shriek. Adam
started to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) feet and stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) arms towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). But the
arms could not reach her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had fallen down in a fainting fit, and
was carried out of court.




<p/>575

<p/>Chapter XLIV
Arthur's Return

<p/>W

<p/>hen Arthur Donnithorne landed at Liverpool and read
the letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) Aunt Lydia, briefly announcing his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>)
grandfather's death, his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) first feeling was, <div class="bookquote">``Poor
Grandfather! I wish I could have got to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) to be with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) died. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) might have felt or wished something at the last that I
shall never know now. It was a lonely death.''
 (<font color='red'><b>grandfather</b></font>)</div>It is impossible to say that his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) grief was deeper than that. Pity
and softened memory took place of the old antagonism, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>)
busy thoughts about the future, as the chaise carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) rapidly
along towards the home where he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) was now to be master, there was
a continually recurring effort to remember anything by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>)
could show a regard for his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) grandfather's wishes, without
counteracting his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) own cherished aims for the good of the tenants
and the estate. But it is not in human nature--only in human
pretence--for a young man like Arthur, with a fine constitution
and fine spirits, thinking well of himself, believing that others
think well of him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and having a very ardent intention to give them
more and more reason for that good opinion--it is not possible for
such a young man, just coming into a splendid estate through the
death of a very old man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not fond of, to feel anything
very different from exultant joy. Now his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) real life was beginning;
now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have room and opportunity for action, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
use them. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would show the Loamshire people what a fine
country gentleman was; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not exchange that career for any




<p/>576

<p/>other under the sun. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt himself riding over the hills in the
breezy autumn days, looking after favourite plans of drainage and
enclosure; then admired on sombre mornings as the best rider on
the best horse in the hunt; spoken well of on market-days as a
first-rate landlord; by and by making speeches at election dinners,
and showing a wonderful knowledge of agriculture; the patron of
new ploughs and drills, the severe upbraider of negligent
landowners, and withal a jolly fellow that everybody must like--
happy faces greeting him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) everywhere on his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own estate, and the
neighbouring families on the best terms with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). The Irwines
should dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) every week, and have their own carriage to
come in, for in some very delicate way that Arthur would devise,
the lay-impropriator of the Hayslope tithes would insist on paying
a couple of hundreds more to the vicar; and his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) aunt should be as
comfortable as possible, and go on living at the Chase, if she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) liked,
in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) old-maidish ways--at least until he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) was married,
and that event lay in the indistinct background, for Arthur had not
yet seen the woman who would play the lady-wife to the first-rate
country gentleman.
These were Arthur's chief thoughts, so far as a man's thoughts
through hours of travelling can be compressed into a few
sentences, which are only like the list of names telling you what
are the scenes in a long, long panorama full of colour, of detail,
and of life. The happy faces Arthur saw greeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) were not pale
abstractions, but real ruddy faces, long familiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>): Martin
Poyser was there--the whole Poyser family.
What--Hetty?
Yes; for Arthur was at ease about Hetty--not quite at ease
about the past, for a certain burning of the ears would come



<p/>577

<p/>whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) thought of the scenes with Adam last August, but at
ease about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) present lot. Mr. Irwine, who had been a regular
correspondent, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) all the news about the old places and
people, had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) word nearly three months ago that Adam
Bede was not to marry Mary Burge, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) had thought, but pretty
Hetty Sorrel. Martin Poyser and Adam himself had both told Mr.
Irwine all about it--that Adam had been deeply in love with Hetty
these two years, and that now it was agreed they were to be
married in March. That stalwart rogue Adam was more
susceptible than the rector had thought; it was really quite an
idyllic love affair; and if it had not been too long to tell in a letter,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would have liked to describe to Arthur the blushing looks and
the simple strong words with which the fine honest fellow told his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
secret. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) knew Arthur would like to hear that Adam had this sort
of happiness in prospect.
Yes, indeed! Arthur felt there was not air enough in the room to
satisfy his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) renovated life, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had read that passage in the
letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) threw up the windows, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) rushed out of doors into the
December air, and greeted every one who spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) with an
eager gaiety, as if there had been news of a fresh Nelson victory.
For the first time that day since he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) had come to Windsor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) was in
true boyish spirits. The load that had been pressing upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) was
gone, the haunting fear had vanished. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) could
conquer his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) bitterness towards Adam now--could offer him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
hand, and ask to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) friend again, in spite of that painful
memory which would still make his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) ears burn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had been
knocked down, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had been forced to tell a lie: such things
make a scar, do what we will. But if Adam were the same again as
in the old days, Arthur wished to be the same too, and to have



<p/>578

<p/>Adam mixed up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) business and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) future, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had always
desired before the accursed meeting in August. Nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would do
a great deal more for Adam than he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) should otherwise have done,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) came into the estate; Hetty's husband had a special claim
on him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)--Hetty herself should feel that any pain she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had suffered
through Arthur in the past was compensated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) a hundredfold.
For really she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) could not have felt much, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had so soon
made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mind to marry Adam.
You perceive clearly what sort of picture Adam and Hetty made
in the panorama of Arthur's thoughts on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) journey homeward. It
was March now; they were soon to be married: perhaps they were
already married. And now it was actually in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) power to do a great
deal for them. Sweet--sweet little Hetty! The little puss hadn't
cared for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) half as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) cared for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>); for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was a great
fool about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) still--was almost afraid of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)--indeed, had
not cared much to look at any other woman since he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) parted from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). That little figure coming towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) in the Grove, those
dark-fringed childish eyes, the lovely lips put up to kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)--that
picture had got no fainter with the lapse of months. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would
look just the same. It was impossible to think how he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could meet
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) should certainly tremble. Strange, how long this sort of
influence lasts, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was certainly not in love with Hetty now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
had been earnestly desiring, for months, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) should marry
Adam, and there was nothing that contributed more to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
happiness in these moments than the thought of their marriage. It
was the exaggerating effect of imagination that made his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) heart still
beat a little more quickly at the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) saw the
little thing again as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) really was, as Adam's wife, at work quite
prosaically in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) new home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) should perhaps wonder at the



<p/>579

<p/>possibility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) past feelings. Thank heaven it had turned out so
well! He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) should have plenty of affairs and interests to fill his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) life
now, and not be in danger of playing the fool again.
Pleasant the crack of the postboy's whip! Pleasant the sense of
being hurried along in swift ease through English scenes, so like
those round his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) own home, only not quite so charming. Here was a
market-town--very much like Treddleston--where the arms of the
neighbouring lord of the manor were borne on the sign of the
principal inn; then mere fields and hedges, their vicinity to a
market-town carrying an agreeable suggestion of high rent, till the
land began to assume a trimmer look, the woods were more
frequent, and at length a white or red mansion looked down from
a moderate eminence, or allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) to be aware of its parapet
and chimneys among the dense-looking masses of oaks and elms--
masses reddened now with early buds. And close at hand came the
village: the small church, with its red-tiled roof, looking humble
even among the faded half-timbered houses; the old green
gravestones with nettles round them; nothing fresh and bright but
the children, opening round eyes at the swift post-chaise; nothing
noisy and busy but the gaping curs of mysterious pedigree. What a
much prettier village Hayslope was! And it should not be
neglected like this place: vigorous repairs should go on
everywhere among farm-buildings and cottages, and travellers in
post-chaises, coming along the Rosseter road, should do nothing
but admire as they went. And Adam Bede should superintend all
the repairs, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) had a share in Burge's business now, and, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>)
liked, Arthur would put some money into the concern and buy the
old man out in another year or two. That was an ugly fault in
Arthur's life, that affair last summer, but the future should make



<p/>580

<p/>amends. Many men would have retained a feeling of
vindictiveness towards Adam, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would not--he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would
resolutely overcome all littleness of that kind, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had certainly
been very much in the wrong; and though Adam had been harsh
and violent, and had thrust on him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) a painful dilemma, the poor
fellow was in love, and had real provocation. No, Arthur had not
an evil feeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mind towards any human being: he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was
happy, and would make every one else happy that came within his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
reach.
And here was dear old Hayslope at last, sleeping, on the hill,
like a quiet old place as it was, in the late afternoon sunlight, and
opposite to it the great shoulders of the Binton Hills, below them
the purplish blackness of the hanging woods, and at last the pale
front of the Abbey, looking out from among the oaks of the Chase,
as if anxious for the heir's return. <div class="bookquote">``Poor Grandfather! And he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) lies
dead there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) was a young fellow once, coming into the estate
and making his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) plans. So the world goes round! Aunt Lydia must
feel very desolate, poor thing; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) shall be indulged as much as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) indulges her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) fat Fido.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>The wheels of Arthur's chaise had been anxiously listened for at
the Chase, for to-day was Friday, and the funeral had already been
deferred two days. Before it drew up on the gravel of the
courtyard, all the servants in the house were assembled to receive
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) with a grave, decent welcome, befitting a house of death. A
month ago, perhaps, it would have been difficult for them to have
maintained a suitable sadness in their faces, when Mr. Arthur was
come to take possession; but the hearts of the head-servants were
heavy that day for another cause than the death of the old squire,
and more than one of them was longing to be twenty miles away,



<p/>581

<p/>as Mr. Craig was, knowing what was to become of Hetty Sorrel--
pretty Hetty Sorrel--whom they used to see every week. They had
the partisanship of household servants who like their places, and
were not inclined to go the full length of the severe indignation felt
against him (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) by the farming tenants, but rather to make excuses for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>); nevertheless, the upper servants, who had been on terms of
neighbourly intercourse with the Poysers for many years, could
not help feeling that the longed-for event of the young squire's
coming into the estate had been robbed of all its pleasantness.
To Arthur it was nothing surprising that the servants looked
grave and sad: he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) himself was very much touched on seeing them
all again, and feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was in a new relation to them. It was
that sort of pathetic emotion which has more pleasure than pain in
it--which is perhaps one of the most delicious of all states to a
good-natured man, conscious of the power to satisfy his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) good
nature. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart swelled agreeably as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``Well, Mills, how is my aunt?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But now Mr. Bygate, the lawyer, who had been in the house
ever since the death, came forward to give deferential greetings
and answer all questions, and Arthur walked with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) towards the
library, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) Aunt Lydia was expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). Aunt Lydia was
the only person in the house who knew nothing about Hetty. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
sorrow as a maiden daughter was unmixed with any other
thoughts than those of anxiety about funeral arrangements and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) own future lot; and, after the manner of women, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mourned
for the father who had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) life important, all the more
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had a secret sense that there was little mourning for
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in other hearts.
But Arthur kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) tearful face more tenderly than he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had



<p/>582

<p/>ever done in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) life before.
<div class="bookquote">``Dear Aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said affectionately, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``your

it up to you all the rest of your life.''

began, pouring out her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) little plaints, and Arthur sat down to listen
with impatient patience. When a pause came, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said:
<div class="bookquote">``Now, Aunt, I'll leave you for a quarter of an hour just to go to
my own room, and then I shall come and give full attention to
everything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My room is all ready for me, I suppose, Mills?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said to the
butler, who seemed to be lingering uneasily about the entrancehall.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, and there are letters for you; they are all laid on the
writing-table in your dressing-room.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>On entering the small anteroom which was called a dressingroom, but which Arthur really used only to lounge and write in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
just cast his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) eyes on the writing-table, and saw that there were
several letters and packets lying there; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was in the
uncomfortable dusty condition of a man who has had a long
hurried journey, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) must really refresh himself by attending
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) toilette a little, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) read his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) letters. Pym was there,
making everything ready for him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and soon, with a delightful
freshness about him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) were prepared to begin a new day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
went back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) dressing-room to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) letters. The level
rays of the low afternoon sun entered directly at the window, and
as Arthur seated himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) velvet chair with their pleasant
warmth upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was conscious of that quiet well-being which
perhaps you and I have felt on a sunny afternoon when, in our



<p/>583

<p/>brightest youth and health, life has opened a new vista for us, and
long to-morrows of activity have stretched before us like a lovely
plain which there was no need for hurrying to look at, because it
was all our own.
The top letter was placed with its address upwards: it was in
Mr. Irwine's handwriting, Arthur saw at once; and below the
address was written, <div class="bookquote">``To be delivered as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mills</b></font>) arrives.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>Nothing could have been less surprising to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) than a letter from
Mr. Irwine at that moment: of course, there was something he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
wished Arthur to know earlier than it was possible for them to see
each other. At such a time as that it was quite natural that Irwine
should have something pressing to say. Arthur broke the seal with
an agreeable anticipation of soon seeing the writer.
``I send this letter to meet you on your arrival, Arthur, because I
may then be at Stoniton, whither I am called by the most painful duty
it has ever been given me to perform, and it is right that you should
know what I have to tell you without delay.
``I will not attempt to add by one word of reproach to the
retribution that is now falling on you: any other words that I could
write at this moment must be weak and unmeaning by the side of
those in which I must tell you the simple fact.
<div class="bookquote">``Hetty Sorrel is in prison, and will be tried on Friday for the
crime of child-murder ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>Arthur read no more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) started up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) chair and stood for
a single minute with a sense of violent convulsion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) whole
frame, as if the life were going out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) with horrible throbs; but
the next minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had rushed out of the room, still clutching the



<p/>584

<p/>letter--he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was hurrying along the corridor, and down the stairs
into the hall. Mills was still there, but Arthur did not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
passed like a hunted man across the hall and out along the gravel.
The butler hurried out after him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) as fast as his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) elderly limbs could
run: he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) guessed, he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) knew, where the young squire was going.
When Mills got to the stables, a horse was being saddled, and
Arthur was forcing himself to read the remaining words of the
letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) thrust it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) pocket as the horse was led up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>),
and at that moment caught sight of Mills' anxious face in front of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Mills</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Tell them I'm gone--gone to Stoniton,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mills</b></font>) said in a muffled
tone of agitation--sprang into the saddle, and set off at a gallop.

<p/>Chapter XLV
In the Prison

<p/>N

<p/>ear sunset that evening an elderly gentleman was
standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) back against the smaller entrance-door
of Stoniton jail, saying a few last words to the departing
chaplain. The chaplain walked away, but the elderly gentleman
stood still, looking down on the pavement and stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chin
with a ruminating air, when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was roused by a sweet clear
woman's voice, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Can I get into the prison, if you please?''
 (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head and looked fixedly at the speaker for a few
moments without answering.
<div class="bookquote">``I have seen you before,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``Do you remember
preaching on the village green at Hayslope in Loamshire?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, surely. Are you the gentleman that stayed to listen on
horseback?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Why do you want to go into the prison?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I want to go to Hetty Sorrel, the young woman who has been
condemned to death--and to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sorrel</b></font>), if I may be permitted.
Have you power in the prison, sir?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I am a magistrate, and can get admittance for you. But
did you know this criminal, Hetty Sorrel?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, we are kin. My own aunt married her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) uncle, Martin
Poyser. But I was away at Leeds, and didn't know of this great
trouble in time to get here before to-day. I entreat you, sir, for the
love of our heavenly Father, to let me go to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) and stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Leeds</b></font>)</div>``How did you know she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was condemned to death, if you are



<p/>586

<p/>only just come from Leeds?''
``I have seen my uncle since the trial, sir. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is gone back to his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
home now, and the poor sinner is forsaken of all. I beseech you to
get leave for me to be with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).''
``What! Have you courage to stay all night in the prison? She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is
very sullen, and will scarcely make answer when she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is spoken to.''
``Oh, sir, it may please God to open her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) heart still. Don't let us
delay.''
``Come, then,'' said the elderly gentleman, ringing and gaining
admission, ``I know you have a key to unlock hearts.''
Dinah mechanically took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) bonnet and shawl as soon as
they were within the prison court, from the habit she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had of
throwing them off when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) preached or prayed, or visited the
sick; and when they entered the jailer's room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) laid them down
on a chair unthinkingly. There was no agitation visible in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), but
a deep concentrated calmness, as if, even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was speaking,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) soul was in prayer reposing on an unseen support.
After speaking to the jailer, the magistrate turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) and
said, ``The turnkey will take you to the prisoner's cell and leave
you there for the night, if you desire it, but you can't have a light
during the night--it is contrary to rules. My name is Colonel
Townley: if I can help you in anything, ask the jailer for my
address and come to me. I take some interest in this Hetty Sorrel,
for the sake of that fine fellow, Adam Bede. I happened to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>)
at Hayslope the same evening I heard you preach, and recognised
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) in court to-day, ill as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) looked.''
<div class="bookquote">``Ah, sir, can you tell me anything about him (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>)? Can you tell me
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) lodges? For my poor uncle was too much weighed down
with trouble to remember.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>587

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Close by here. I inquired all about him (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) of Mr. Irwine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
lodges over a tinman's shop, in the street on the right hand as you
entered the prison. There is an old school-master with him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>). Now,
good-bye: I wish you success.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Farewell, sir. I am grateful to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>As Dinah crossed the prison court with the turnkey, the solemn
evening light seemed to make the walls higher than they were by
day, and the sweet pale face in the cap was more than ever like a
white flower on this background of gloom. The turnkey looked
askance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) all the while, but never spoke. He (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) somehow felt
that the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) own rude voice would be grating just then.
He (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) struck a light as they entered the dark corridor leading to the
condemned cell, and then said in his (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) most civil tone, <div class="bookquote">``It'll be pretty
nigh dark in the cell a'ready, but I can stop with my light a bit, if
you like.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nay, friend, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>said Dinah. <div class="bookquote">``I wish to go in alone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``As you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>the jailer</b></font>)</div>said the jailer, turning the harsh key in the lock
and opening the door wide enough to admit Dinah. A jet of light
from his (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) lantern fell on the opposite corner of the cell, where Hetty
was sitting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) straw pallet with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) face buried in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knees. It
seemed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) were asleep, and yet the grating of the lock would
have been likely to waken her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>).
The door closed again, and the only light in the cell was that of
the evening sky, through the small high grating--enough to
discern human faces by. Dinah stood still for a minute, hesitating
to speak because Hetty might be asleep, and looking at the
motionless heap with a yearning heart. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said, softly,
<div class="bookquote">``Hetty!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>There was a slight movement perceptible in Hetty's frame--a



<p/>588

<p/>start such as might have been produced by a feeble electrical
shock--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) did not look up. Dinah spoke again, in a tone made
stronger by irrepressible emotion:
<div class="bookquote">``Hetty ... it's Dinah.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>Again there was a slight startled movement through Hetty's
frame, and without uncovering her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) head a
little, as if listening.
<div class="bookquote">``Hetty ... Dinah is come to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>After a moment's pause, Hetty lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) head slowly and
timidly from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knees and raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eyes. The two pale faces
were looking at each other: one with a wild hard despair in it, the
other full of sad yearning love. Dinah unconsciously opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
arms and stretched them out.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't you know me, Hetty? Don't you remember Dinah? Did
you think I wouldn't come to you in trouble?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>Hetty kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eyes fixed on Dinah's face--at first like an
animal that gazes, and gazes, and keeps aloof.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm come to be with you, Hetty--not to leave you--to stay with
you--to be your sister to the last.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>Slowly, while Dinah was speaking, Hetty rose, took a step
forward, and was clasped in Dinah's arms.
They stood so a long while, for neither of them felt the impulse
to move apart again. Hetty, without any distinct thought of it, hung
on this something that was come to clasp her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) now, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was
sinking helpless in a dark gulf; and Dinah felt a deep joy in the
first sign that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) love was welcomed by the wretched lost one.
The light got fainter as they stood, and when at last they sat down
on the straw pallet together, their faces had become indistinct.
Not a word was spoken. Dinah waited, hoping for a



<p/>589

<p/>spontaneous word from Hetty, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) sat in the same dull
despair, only clutching the hand that held hers and leaning her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
cheek against Dinah's. It was the human contact she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) clung to, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was not the less sinking into the dark gulf.
Dinah began to doubt whether Hetty was conscious who it was
that sat beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thought suffering and fear might have
driven the poor sinner out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mind. But it was borne in upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) afterwards said, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) must not hurry God's work:
we are overhasty to speak--as if God did not manifest himself by
our silent feeling, and make his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) love felt through ours. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) did not
know how long they sat in that way, but it got darker and darker,
till there was only a pale patch of light on the opposite wall: all the
rest was darkness. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt the Divine presence more and
more--nay, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) herself were a part of it, and it was the Divine
pity that was beating in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heart and was willing the rescue of
this helpless one. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was prompted to speak and find out
how far Hetty was conscious of the present.
<div class="bookquote">``Hetty,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said gently, <div class="bookquote">``do you know who it is that sits by
your side?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>Hetty answered slowly, <div class="bookquote">``it's Dinah.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And do you remember the time when we were at the Hall
Farm together, and that night when I told you to be sure and think
of me as a friend in trouble?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>said Hetty. Then, after a pause, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``But you can
do nothing for me. You can't make ’em do anything. They'll hang
me o' Monday--it's Friday now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As Hetty said the last words, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) clung closer to Dinah,
shuddering.
``No, Hetty, I can't save you from that death. But isn't the



<p/>590

<p/>suffering less hard when you have somebody with you, that feels
for you--that you can speak to, and say what's in your heart? ...
Yes, Hetty: you lean on me: you are glad to have me with you.''
``You won't leave me, Dinah? You'll keep close to me?''
``No, Hetty, I won't leave you. I'll stay with you to the last ...
But, Hetty, there is some one else in this cell besides me, some one
close to you.''
Hetty said, in a frightened whisper, ``Who?''
``Some one who has been with you through all your hours of sin
and trouble--who has known every thought you have had--has
seen where you went, where you lay down and rose up again, and
all the deeds you have tried to hide in darkness. And on Monday,
when I can't follow you--when my arms can't reach you--when
death has parted us--He (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) who is with us now, and knows all, will
be with you then. It makes no difference--whether we live or die,
we are in the presence of God.''
``Oh, Dinah, won't nobody do anything for me? Will they hang
me for certain? ... I wouldn't mind if they'd let me live.''
``My poor Hetty, death is very dreadful to you. I know it's
dreadful. But if you had a friend to take care of you after death--in
that other world--some one whose love is greater than mine--who
can do everything? ... If God our Father was your friend, and was
willing to save you from sin and suffering, so as you should neither
know wicked feelings nor pain again? If you could believe he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) loved
you and would help you, as you believe I love you and will help
you, it wouldn't be so hard to die on Monday, would it?''
``But I can't know anything about it,'' Hetty said, with sullen
sadness.
``Because, Hetty, you are shutting up your soul against him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), by



<p/>591

<p/>trying to hide the truth. God's love and mercy can overcome all
things--our ignorance, and weakness, and all the burden of our
past wickedness--all things but our wilful sin, sin that we cling to,
and will not give up. You believe in my love and pity for you,
Hetty, but if you had not let me come near you, if you wouldn't
have looked at me or spoken to me, you'd have shut me out from
helping you. I couldn't have made you feel my love; I couldn't have
told you what I felt for you. Don't shut God's love out in that way,
by clinging to sin ... He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) can't bless you while you have one
falsehood in your soul; his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pardoning mercy can't reach you until
you open your heart to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and say, `I have done this great
wickedness; O God, save me, make me pure from sin.' While you
cling to one sin and will not part with it, it must drag you down to
misery after death, as it has dragged you to misery here in this
world, my poor, poor Hetty. It is sin that brings dread, and
darkness, and despair: there is light and blessedness for us as soon
as we cast it off. God enters our souls then, and teaches us, and
brings us strength and peace. Cast it off now, Hetty--now: confess
the wickedness you have done--the sin you have been guilty of
against your Heavenly Father. Let us kneel down together, for we
are in the presence of God.''
Hetty obeyed Dinah's movement, and sank on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knees. They
still held each other's hands, and there was long silence. Then
Dinah said, ``Hetty, we are before God. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is waiting for you to tell
the truth.''
Still there was silence. At last Hetty spoke, in a tone of
beseeching--
<div class="bookquote">``Dinah ... help me ... I can't feel anything like you ... my
heart is hard.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah</b></font>)</div><p/>592

<p/>Dinah held the clinging hand, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) soul went forth in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
voice:
``Jesus, thou present Saviour! Thou hast known the depths of
all sorrow: thou hast entered that black darkness where God is
not, and hast uttered the cry of the forsaken. Come Lord, and
gather of the fruits of thy travail and thy pleading. Stretch forth
thy hand, thou who art mighty to save to the uttermost, and rescue
this lost one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) is clothed round with thick darkness. The fetters
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) sin are upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) cannot stir to come to thee. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
can only feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) heart is hard, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) is helpless. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) cries to me,
thy weak creature ... Saviour! It is a blind cry to thee. Hear it!
Pierce the darkness! Look upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) with thy face of love and
sorrow that thou didst turn on him (<font color='blue'><b>Pierce</b></font>) who denied thee, and melt her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
hard heart.
``See, Lord, I bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), as they of old brought the sick and
helpless, and thou didst heal them. I bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) on my arms and
carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) before thee. Fear and trembling have taken hold on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>),
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) trembles only at the pain and death of the body. Breathe
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) thy life-giving Spirit, and put a new fear within her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)--the
fear of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) sin. Make her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) dread to keep the accursed thing within
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) soul. Make her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) feel the presence of the living God, who
beholds all the past, to whom the darkness is as noonday; who is
waiting now, at the eleventh hour, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) to turn to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and
confess her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) sin, and cry for mercy--now, before the night of death
comes, and the moment of pardon is for ever fled, like yesterday
that returneth not.
``Saviour! It is yet time--time to snatch this poor soul from
everlasting darkness. I believe--I believe in thy infinite love. What



<p/>593

<p/>is my love or my pleading? It is quenched in thine. I can only clasp
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) in my weak arms and urge her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) with my weak pity. Thou--thou
wilt breathe on the dead soul, and it shall arise from the
unanswering sleep of death.
``Yea, Lord, I see thee, coming through the darkness coming,
like the morning, with healing on thy wings. The marks of thy
agony are upon thee--I see, I see thou art able and willing to
save--thou wilt not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) perish for ever. ``Come, mighty
Saviour! Let the dead hear thy voice. Let the eyes of the blind be
opened. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) see that God encompasses her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) tremble at
nothing but at the sin that cuts her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) off from him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). Melt the hard
heart. Unseal the closed lips: make her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) cry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) whole soul,
`Father, I have sinned' ... ''
``Dinah,'' Hetty sobbed out, throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) arms round Dinah's
neck, ``I will speak ... I will tell ... I won't hide it any more.''
But the tears and sobs were too violent. Dinah raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) gently
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) knees and seated her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) on the pallet again, sitting down by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) side. It was a long time before the convulsed throat was quiet,
and even then they sat some time in stillness and darkness,
holding each other's hands. At last Hetty whispered, ``I did do it,
Dinah ... I buried it in the wood ... the little baby ... and it cried .
. . I heard it cry ... ever such a way off ... all night ... and I went
back because it cried.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) paused, and then spoke hurriedly in a louder, pleading
tone.
``But I thought perhaps it wouldn't die--there might somebody
find it. I didn't kill it--I didn't kill it myself. I put it down there and
covered it up, and when I came back it was gone ... It was



<p/>594

<p/>because I was so very miserable, Dinah ... I didn't know where to
go ... and I tried to kill myself before, and I couldn't. Oh, I tried so
to drown myself in the pool, and I couldn't. I went to Windsor--I
ran away--did you know? I went to find him (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) might take
care of me; and he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) was gone; and then I didn't know what to do. I
daredn't go back home again--I couldn't bear it. I couldn't have
bore to look at anybody, for they'd have scorned me. I thought o'
you sometimes, and thought I'd come to you, for I didn't think
you'd be cross with me, and cry shame on me. I thought I could
tell you. But then the other folks 'ud come to know it at last, and I
couldn't bear that. It was partly thinking o' you made me come
toward Stoniton; and, besides, I was so frightened at going
wandering about till I was a beggar-woman, and had nothing; and
sometimes it seemed as if I must go back to the farm sooner than
that. Oh, it was so dreadful, Dinah ... I was so miserable ... I
wished I'd never been born into this world. I should never like to
go into the green fields again--I hated ’em so in my misery.''
Hetty paused again, as if the sense of the past were too strong
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) for words.
``And then I got to Stoniton, and I began to feel frightened that
night, because I was so near home. And then the little baby was
born, when I didn't expect it; and the thought came into my mind
that I might get rid of it and go home again. The thought came all
of a sudden, as I was lying in the bed, and it got stronger and
stronger ... I longed so to go back again ... I couldn't bear being
so lonely and coming to beg for want. And it gave me strength and
resolution to get up and dress myself. I felt I must do it ... I didn't
know how ... I thought I'd find a pool, if I could, like that other, in
the corner of the field, in the dark. And when the woman went out,



<p/>595

<p/>I felt as if I was strong enough to do anything ... I thought I
should get rid of all my misery, and go back home, and never let
’em know why I ran away I put on my bonnet and shawl, and went
out into the dark street, with the baby under my cloak; and I
walked fast till I got into a street a good way off, and there was a
public, and I got some warm stuff to drink and some bread. And I
walked on and on, and I hardly felt the ground I trod on; and it got
lighter, for there came the moon--oh, Dinah, it frightened me
when it first looked at me out o' the clouds--it never looked so
before; and I turned out of the road into the fields, for I was afraid
o' meeting anybody with the moon shining on me. And I came to a
haystack, where I thought I could lie down and keep myself warm
all night. There was a place cut into it, where I could make me a
bed, and I lay comfortable, and the baby was warm against me;
and I must have gone to sleep for a good while, for when I woke it
was morning, but not very light, and the baby was crying. And I
saw a wood a little way off ... I thought there'd perhaps be a ditch
or a pond there ... and it was so early I thought I could hide the
child there, and get a long way off before folks was up. And then I
thought I'd go home--I'd get rides in carts and go home and tell
’em I'd been to try and see for a place, and couldn't get one. I
longed so for it, Dinah, I longed so to be safe at home. I don't know
how I felt about the baby. I seemed to hate it--it was like a heavy
weight hanging round my neck; and yet its crying went through
me, and I daredn't look at its little hands and face. But I went on to
the wood, and I walked about, but there was no water ... ''
Hetty shuddered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was silent for some moments, and when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) began again, it was in a whisper.
``I came to a place where there was lots of chips and turf, and I



<p/>596

<p/>sat down on the trunk of a tree to think what I should do. And all
of a sudden I saw a hole under the nut-tree, like a little grave. And
it darted into me like lightning--I'd lay the baby there and cover it
with the grass and the chips. I couldn't kill it any other way. And
I'd done it in a minute; and, oh, it cried so, Dinah--I couldn't cover
it quite up--I thought perhaps somebody 'ud come and take care
of it, and then it wouldn't die. And I made haste out of the wood,
but I could hear it crying all the while; and when I got out into the
fields, it was as if I was held fast--I couldn't go away, for all I
wanted so to go. And I sat against the haystack to watch if anybody
'ud come. I was very hungry, and I'd only a bit of bread left, but I
couldn't go away. And after ever such a while--hours and hours--
the man came--him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in a smock-frock, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at me so, I
was frightened, and I made haste and went on. I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
going to the wood and would perhaps find the baby. And I went
right on, till I came to a village, a long way off from the wood, and I
was very sick, and faint, and hungry. I got something to eat there,
and bought a loaf. But I was frightened to stay. I heard the baby
crying, and thought the other folks heard it too--and I went on.
But I was so tired, and it was getting towards dark. And at last, by
the roadside there was a barn--ever such a way off any house--
like the barn in Abbot's Close, and I thought I could go in there
and hide myself among the hay and straw, and nobody 'ud be
likely to come. I went in, and it was half full o' trusses of straw, and
there was some hay too. And I made myself a bed, ever so far
behind, where nobody could find me; and I was so tired and weak,
I went to sleep ... But oh, the baby's crying kept waking me, and I
thought that man as looked at me so was come and laying hold of
me. But I must have slept a long while at last, though I didn't



<p/>597

<p/>know, for when I got up and went out of the barn, I didn't know
whether it was night or morning. But it was morning, for it kept
getting lighter, and I turned back the way I'd come. I couldn't help
it, Dinah; it was the baby's crying made me go--and yet I was
frightened to death. I thought that man in the smock-frock 'ud see
me and know I put the baby there. But I went on, for all that. I'd
left off thinking about going home--it had gone out o' my mind. I
saw nothing but that place in the wood where I'd buried the baby .
. . I see it now. Oh Dinah! shall I allays see it?''
Hetty clung round Dinah and shuddered again. The silence
seemed long before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) went on.
``I met nobody, for it was very early, and I got into the wood ...
I knew the way to the place ... the place against the nut-tree; and
I could hear it crying at every step ... I thought it was alive ... I
don't know whether I was frightened or glad ... I don't know what
I felt. I only know I was in the wood and heard the cry. I don't
know what I felt till I saw the baby was gone. And when I'd put it
there, I thought I should like somebody to find it and save it from
dying; but when I saw it was gone, I was struck like a stone, with
fear. I never thought o' stirring, I felt so weak. I knew I couldn't
run away, and everybody as saw me 'ud know about the baby. My
heart went like a stone. I couldn't wish or try for anything; it
seemed like as if I should stay there for ever, and nothing 'ud ever
change. But they came and took me away.''
Hetty was silent, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) shuddered again, as if there was still
something behind; and Dinah waited, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) heart was so full that
tears must come before words. At last Hetty burst out, with a sob,
<div class="bookquote">``Dinah, do you think God will take away that crying and the place
in the wood, now I've told everything?''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>598

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us pray, poor sinner. Let us fall on our knees again, and

<p/>Chapter XLVI
The Hours of Suspense

<p/>O

<p/>n Sunday morning, when the church bells in Stoniton
were ringing for morning service, Bartle Massey reentered Adam's room, after a short absence, and said,
<div class="bookquote">``Adam, here's a visitor wants to see you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam was seated with is back towards the door, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) started
up and turned round instantly, with a flushed face and an eager
look. His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) face was even thinner and more worn than we have seen
it before, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was washed and shaven this Sunday morning.
<div class="bookquote">``Is it any news?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Keep yourself quiet, my lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div>said Bartle; <div class="bookquote">``keep quiet. It's not
what you're thinking of. It's the young Methodist woman come
from the prison. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s at the bottom o' the stairs, and wants to
know if you think well to see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has something to say to
you about that poor castaway; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wouldn't come in without
your leave, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought you'd perhaps like to go out and
speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). These preaching women are not so back'ard
commonly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div>Bartle muttered to himself.
<div class="bookquote">``Ask her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) face towards the door, and as Dinah
entered, lifting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) mild grey eyes towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) saw at once
the great change that had come since the day when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had looked
up at the tall man in the cottage. There was a trembling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
clear voice as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and said, <div class="bookquote">``Be comforted,
Adam Bede, the Lord has not forsaken her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''




 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>600

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless you for coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam said. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Massey brought
me word yesterday as you was come.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They could neither of them say any more just yet, but stood
before each other in silence; and Bartle Massey, too, who had put
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) spectacles, seemed transfixed, examining Dinah's face. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) recovered himself first, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Sit down, young woman, sit
down,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>placing the chair for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) and retiring to his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) old seat on the
bed.
<div class="bookquote">``Thank you, friend; I won't sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>said Dinah, <div class="bookquote">``for I must
hasten back. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) entreated me not to stay long away. What I came
for, Adam Bede, was to pray you to go and see the poor sinner and
bid her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) farewell. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) desires to ask your forgiveness, and it is meet
you should see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to-day, rather than in the early morning, when
the time will be short.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>Adam stood trembling, and at last sank down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) chair
again.
<div class="bookquote">``It won't be,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it'll be put off--there'll perhaps come a
pardon. Mr. Irwine said there was hope. He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) said, I needn't quite
give it up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's a blessed thought to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>said Dinah, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) eyes filling
with tears. <div class="bookquote">``It's a fearful thing hurrying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soul away so fast.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But let what will be,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) added presently. ``You will surely
come, and let her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) speak the words that are in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart. Although
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) poor soul is very dark and discerns little beyond the things of
the flesh, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is no longer hard. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is contrite, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has confessed
all to me. The pride of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart has given way, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) leans on
me for help and desires to be taught. This fills me with trust, for I
cannot but think that the brethren sometimes err in measuring
the Divine love by the sinner's knowledge. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is going to write a



<p/>601

<p/>letter to the friends at the Hall Farm for me to give them when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
is gone, and when I told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) you were here, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, `I should like
to say good-bye to Adam and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to forgive me.' You will
come, Adam? Perhaps you will even now come back with me.''
``I can't,'' Adam said. ``I can't say good-bye while there's any
hope. I'm listening, and listening--I can't think o' nothing but that.
It can't be as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll die that shameful death--I can't bring my mind
to it.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) got up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) chair again and looked away out of the
window, while Dinah stood with compassionate patience. In a
minute or two he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) turned round and said,
``I will come, Dinah ... to-morrow morning ... if it must be. I
may have more strength to bear it, if I know it must be. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), I
forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>); tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) I will come--at the very last.''
``I will not urge you against the voice of your own heart,'' said
Dinah. ``I must hasten back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), for it is wonderful how she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
clings now, and was not willing to let me out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) sight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) used
never to make any return to my affection before, but now
tribulation has opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) heart. Farewell, Adam. Our heavenly
Father comfort you and strengthen you to bear all things.'' Dinah
put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hand, and Adam pressed it in silence.
Bartle Massey was getting up to lift the stiff latch of the door for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) could reach it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had said gently, ``Farewell,
friend,'' and was gone, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) light step down the stairs.
``Well,'' said Bartle, taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) spectacles and putting them
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) pocket, <div class="bookquote">``if there must be women to make trouble in the
world, it's but fair there should be women to be comforters under
it; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s one--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s one. It's a pity she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s a Methodist; but
there's no getting a woman without some foolishness or other.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><p/>602

<p/>Adam never went to bed that night. The excitement of
suspense, heightening with every hour that brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) nearer
the fatal moment, was too great, and in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) entreaties, in
spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) promises that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would be perfectly quiet, the
schoolmaster watched too.
<div class="bookquote">``What does it matter to me, lad?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div>Bartle said: <div class="bookquote">``a night's sleep
more or less? I shall sleep long enough, by and by, underground.
Let me keep thee company in trouble while I can.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div>It was a long and dreary night in that small chamber. Adam
would sometimes get up and tread backwards and forwards along
the short space from wall to wall; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would sit down and hide
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) face, and no sound would be heard but the ticking of the watch
on the table, or the falling of a cinder from the fire which the
schoolmaster carefully tended. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would burst out into
vehement speech, <div class="bookquote">``If I could ha' done anything to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)--if my
bearing anything would ha' done any good ... but t' have to sit
still, and know it, and do nothing ... it's hard for a man to bear ...
and to think o' what might ha' been now, if it hadn't been for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) .
. . O God, it's the very day we should ha' been married.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye, my lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div>said Bartle tenderly, <div class="bookquote">``it's heavy--it's heavy. But
you must remember this: when you thought of marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), you'd
a notion she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'d got another sort of a nature inside her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). You didn't
think she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could have got hardened in that little while to do what
she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s done.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know--I know that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam. ``I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was loving
and tender-hearted, and wouldn't tell a lie, or act deceitful. How
could I think any other way? And if he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'d never come near her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and
I'd married her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and been loving to her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and took care of her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
might never ha' done anything bad. What would it ha' signified--



<p/>603

<p/>my having a bit o' trouble with her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)? It 'ud ha' been nothing to
this.''
``There's no knowing, my lad--there's no knowing what might
have come. The smart's bad for you to bear now: you must have
time--you must have time. But I've that opinion of you, that you'll
rise above it all and be a man again, and there may good come out
of this that we don't see.''
``Good come out of it!'' said Adam passionately. ``That doesn't
alter th' evil: her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) ruin can't be undone. I hate that talk o' people, as
if there was a way o' making amends for everything. They'd more
need be brought to see as the wrong they do can never be altered.
When a man's spoiled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fellow-creatur's life, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s no right to
comfort himself with thinking good may come out of it. Somebody
else's good doesn't alter her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) shame and misery.''
``Well, lad, well,'' said Bartle, in a gentle tone, strangely in
contrast with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) usual peremptoriness and impatience of
contradiction, ``it's likely enough I talk foolishness. I'm an old
fellow, and it's a good many years since I was in trouble myself.
It's easy finding reasons why other folks should be patient.''
``Mr. Massey,'' said Adam penitently, ``I'm very hot and hasty. I
owe you something different; but you mustn't take it ill of me.''
``Not I, lad--not I.''
So the night wore on in agitation till the chill dawn and the
growing light brought the tremulous quiet that comes on the brink
of despair. There would soon be no more suspense.
``Let us go to the prison now, Mr. Massey,'' said Adam, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
saw the hand of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) watch at six. <div class="bookquote">``If there's any news come, we
shall hear about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The people were astir already, moving rapidly, in one direction,



<p/>604

<p/>through the streets. Adam tried not to think where they were
going, as they hurried past him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) in that short space between his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
lodging and the prison gates. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was thankful when the gates shut
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) in from seeing those eager people.
No; there was no news come--no pardon--no reprieve.
Adam lingered in the court half an hour before he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could bring
himself to send word to Dinah that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was come. But a voice
caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) ear: he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could not shut out the words.
<div class="bookquote">``The cart is to set off at half-past seven.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It must be said--the last good-bye: there was no help.
In ten minutes from that time, Adam was at the door of the cell.
Dinah had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) word that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) could not come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
could not leave Hetty one moment; but Hetty was prepared for the
meeting.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) entered, for agitation deadened
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) senses, and the dim cell was almost dark to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) stood a
moment after the door closed behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), trembling and
stupefied.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) began to see through the dimness--to see the dark eyes
lifted up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) once more, but with no smile in them. O God, how
sad they looked! The last time they had met his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
parted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heart full of joyous hopeful love, and they
looked out with a tearful smile from a pink, dimpled, childish face.
The face was marble now; the sweet lips were pallid and half-open
and quivering; the dimples were all gone--all but one, that never
went; and the eyes--O, the worst of all was the likeness they had
to Hetty's. They were Hetty's eyes looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) with that
mournful gaze, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had come back to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) from the dead to
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) misery.



<p/>605

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was clinging close to Dinah; her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) cheek was against Dinah's.
It seemed as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) last faint strength and hope lay in that contact,
and the pitying love that shone out from Dinah's face looked like a
visible pledge of the Invisible Mercy.
When the sad eyes met--when Hetty and Adam looked at each
other--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) felt the change in him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) too, and it seemed to strike her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
with fresh fear. It was the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had seen any being whose
face seemed to reflect the change in herself: Adam was a new
image of the dreadful past and the dreadful present. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) trembled
more as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>), Hetty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>Dinah said; <div class="bookquote">``tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) what is in your
heart.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>Hetty obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), like a little child.
<div class="bookquote">``Adam ... I'm very sorry ... I behaved very wrong to you ...
will you forgive me ... before I die?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam answered with a half-sob, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I forgive thee Hetty. I
forgave thee long ago.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>It had seemed to Adam as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) brain would burst with the
anguish of meeting Hetty's eyes in the first moments, but the
sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) voice uttering these penitent words touched a chord
which had been less strained. There was a sense of relief from
what was becoming unbearable, and the rare tears came--they
had never come before, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had hung on Seth's neck in the
beginning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) sorrow.
Hetty made an involuntary movement towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), some of the
love that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had once lived in the midst of was come near her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) kept hold of Dinah's hand, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) went up to Adam
and said timidly, <div class="bookquote">``Will you kiss me again, Adam, for all I've been
so wicked?''



 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><p/>606

<p/>Adam took the blanched wasted hand she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) put out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), and
they gave each other the solemn unspeakable kiss of a lifelong
parting.
<div class="bookquote">``And tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>Hetty said, in rather a stronger voice, <div class="bookquote">``tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) .
. . for there's nobody else to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) ... as I went after him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) and
couldn't find him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) ... and I hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) and cursed him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) once ... but
Dinah says I should forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) ... and I try ... for else God won't
forgive me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Hetty Sorrel/HETTY</b></font>)</div>There was a noise at the door of the cell now--the key was
being turned in the lock, and when the door opened, Adam saw
indistinctly that there were several faces there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was too
agitated to see more--even to see that Mr. Irwine's face was one of
them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) felt that the last preparations were beginning, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
could stay no longer. Room was silently made for him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) to depart,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) chamber in loneliness, leaving Bartle Massey to
watch and see the end.

<p/>Chapter XLVII
The Last Moment

<p/>I

<p/>t was a sight that some people remembered better even than
their own sorrows--the sight in that grey clear morning, when
the fatal cart with the two young women in it was descried by
the waiting watching multitude, cleaving its way towards the
hideous symbol of a deliberately inflicted sudden death.
All Stoniton had heard of Dinah Morris, the young Methodist
woman who had brought the obstinate criminal to confess, and
there was as much eagerness to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) as to see the wretched
Hetty.
But Dinah was hardly conscious of the multitude. When Hetty
had caught sight of the vast crowd in the distance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had
clutched Dinah convulsively.
<div class="bookquote">``Close your eyes, Hetty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>Dinah said, <div class="bookquote">``and let us pray without
ceasing to God.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>And in a low voice, as the cart went slowly along through the
midst of the gazing crowd, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) poured forth her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) soul with the
wrestling intensity of a last pleading, for the trembling creature
that clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) and clutched her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) as the only visible sign of love
and pity.
Dinah did not know that the crowd was silent, gazing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
with a sort of awe--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) did not even know how near they were to
the fatal spot, when the cart stopped, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) shrank appalled at a
loud shout hideous to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) ear, like a vast yell of demons. Hetty's
shriek mingled with the sound, and they clasped each other in




<p/>608

<p/>mutual horror.
But it was not a shout of execration--not a yell of exultant
cruelty.
It was a shout of sudden excitement at the appearance of a
horseman cleaving the crowd at full gallop. The horse is hot and
distressed, but answers to the desperate spurring; the rider looks
as if his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) eyes were glazed by madness, and he (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) saw nothing but
what was unseen by others. See, he (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) has something in his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) hand--he (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>)
is holding it up as if it were a signal.
The Sheriff knows him (<font color='blue'><b>Sheriff</b></font>): it is Arthur Donnithorne, carrying in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) hand a hard-won release from death.




<p/>609

<p/>Chapter XLVIII
Another Meeting in the Wood

<p/>T

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) next day, at evening, two men were walking from
opposite points towards the same scene, drawn thither by
a common memory. The scene was the Grove by
Donnithorne Chase: you know who the men were.
The old squire's funeral had taken place that morning, the will
had been read, and now in the first breathing-space, Arthur
Donnithorne had come out for a lonely walk, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) might look
fixedly at the new future before him (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) and confirm himself in a sad
resolution. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) could do that best in the Grove.
Adam too had come from Stoniton on Monday evening, and today he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had not left home, except to go to the family at the Hall
Farm and tell them everything that Mr. Irwine had left untold. He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
had agreed with the Poysers that he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) would follow them to their
new neighbourhood, wherever that might be, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) meant to give
up the management of the woods, and, as soon as it was
practicable, he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) would wind up his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) business with Jonathan Burge
and settle with his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) mother and Seth in a home within reach of the
friends to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) felt bound by a mutual sorrow.
<div class="bookquote">``Seth and me are sure to find work,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) said. ``A man that's got
our trade at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger-ends is at home everywhere; and we must
make a new start. My mother won't stand in the way, for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s told
me, since I came home, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d made up her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mind to being buried in
another parish, if I wished it, and if I'd be more comfortable
elsewhere. It's wonderful how quiet she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s been ever since I came




<p/>610

<p/>back. It seems as if the very greatness o' the trouble had quieted
and calmed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). We shall all be better in a new country, though
there's some I shall be loath to leave behind. But I won't part from
you and yours, if I can help it, Mr. Poyser. Trouble's made us kin.''
``Aye, lad,'' said Martin. ``We'll go out o' hearing o' that man's
name. But I doubt we shall ne’er go far enough for folks not to find
out as we've got them belonging to us as are transported o’er the
seas, and were like to be hanged. We shall have that flyin' up in
our faces, and our children's after us.''
That was a long visit to the Hall Farm, and drew too strongly on
Adam's energies for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to think of seeing others, or re-entering
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) old occupations till the morrow. ``But to-morrow,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said to
himself, ``I'll go to work again. I shall learn to like it again some
time, maybe; and it's right whether I like it or not.''
This evening was the last he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would allow to be absorbed by
sorrow: suspense was gone now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) must bear the unalterable.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was resolved not to see Arthur Donnithorne again, if it were
possible to avoid him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had no message to deliver from Hetty
now, for Hetty had seen Arthur. And Adam distrusted himself--he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
had learned to dread the violence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) own feeling. That word of
Mr. Irwine's--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) must remember what he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) had felt after giving
the last blow to Arthur in the Grove--had remained with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).
These thoughts about Arthur, like all thoughts that are charged
with strong feeling, were continually recurring, and they always
called up the image of the Grove--of that spot under the
overarching boughs where he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had caught sight of the two bending
figures, and had been possessed by sudden rage.
``I'll go and see it again to-night for the last time,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``it'll
do me good; it'll make me feel over again what I felt when I'd



<p/>611

<p/>knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) down. I felt what poor empty work it was, as soon as
I'd done it, before I began to think he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might be dead.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>In this way it happened that Arthur and Adam were walking
towards the same spot at the same time.
Adam had on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) working-dress again, now, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had thrown
off the other with a sense of relief as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) came home; and if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had had the basket of tools over his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) shoulder, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) might have
been taken, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) pale wasted face, for the spectre of the Adam
Bede who entered the Grove on that August evening eight months
ago. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) had no basket of tools, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) was not walking with
the old erectness, looking keenly round him (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) hands were thrust
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) side pockets, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) eyes rested chiefly on the ground. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>)
had not long entered the Grove, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) paused before a
beech. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) knew that tree well; it was the boundary mark of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>)
youth--the sign, to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>), of the time when some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) earliest,
strongest feelings had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) felt sure they would never
return. And yet, at this moment, there was a stirring of affection at
the remembrance of that Arthur Donnithorne whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) had
believed in before he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnithorne</b></font>) had come up to this beech eight months ago.
It was affection for the dead: that Arthur existed no longer.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was disturbed by the sound of approaching footsteps, but
the beech stood at a turning in the road, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could not see who
was coming until the tall slim figure in deep mourning suddenly
stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) at only two yards' distance. They both started,
and looked at each other in silence. Often, in the last fortnight,
Adam had imagined himself as close to Arthur as this, assailing
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) with words that should be as harrowing as the voice of
remorse, forcing upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) a just share in the misery he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had
caused; and often, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had told himself that such a meeting had



<p/>612

<p/>better not be. But in imagining the meeting he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had always seen
Arthur, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had met him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) on that evening in the Grove, florid,
careless, light of speech; and the figure before him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
with the signs of suffering. Adam knew what suffering was--he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
could not lay a cruel finger on a bruised man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) felt no impulse
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) needed to resist. Silence was more just than reproach.
Arthur was the first to speak.
<div class="bookquote">``Adam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said, quietly, <div class="bookquote">``it may be a good thing that we have
met here, for I wished to see you. I should have asked to see you
to-morrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) paused, but Adam said nothing.
<div class="bookquote">``I know it is painful to you to meet me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>Arthur went on, <div class="bookquote">``but it
is not likely to happen again for years to come.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, coldly, <div class="bookquote">``that was what I meant to write to
you to-morrow, as it would be better all dealings should be at an
end between us, and somebody else put in my place.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Arthur felt the answer keenly, and it was not without an effort
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) spoke again.
<div class="bookquote">``It was partly on that subject I wished to speak to you. I don't
want to lessen your indignation against me, or ask you to do
anything for my sake. I only wish to ask you if you will help me to
lessen the evil consequences of the past, which is unchangeable. I
don't mean consequences to myself, but to others. It is but little I
can do, I know. I know the worst consequences will remain; but
something may be done, and you can help me. Will you listen to
me patiently?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, after some hesitation; <div class="bookquote">``I'll hear what it is.
If I can help to mend anything, I will. Anger 'ull mend nothing, I
know. We've had enough o' that.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><p/>613

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was going to the Hermitage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>said Arthur. <div class="bookquote">``Will you go there
with me and sit down? We can talk better there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>The Hermitage had never been entered since they left it
together, for Arthur had locked up the key in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) desk. And now,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) opened the door, there was the candle burnt out in the
socket; there was the chair in the same place where Adam
remembered sitting; there was the waste-paper basket full of
scraps, and deep down in it, Arthur felt in an instant, there was
the little pink silk handkerchief. It would have been painful to
enter this place if their previous thoughts had been less painful.
They sat down opposite each other in the old places, and Arthur
said, <div class="bookquote">``I'm going away, Adam; I'm going into the army.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>Poor Arthur felt that Adam ought to be affected by this
announcement--ought to have a movement of sympathy towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). But Adam's lips remained firmly closed, and the expression
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) face unchanged.
<div class="bookquote">``What I want to say to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>Arthur continued, <div class="bookquote">``is this: one of
my reasons for going away is that no one else may leave
Hayslope--may leave their home on my account. I would do
anything, there is no sacrifice I would not make, to prevent any
further injury to others through my--through what has
happened.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>Arthur's words had precisely the opposite effect to that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had
anticipated. Adam thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) perceived in them that notion of
compensation for irretrievable wrong, that self-soothing attempt
to make evil bear the same fruits as good, which most of all roused
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) indignation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was as strongly impelled to look painful facts
right in the face as Arthur was to turn away his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) eyes from them.
Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had the wakeful suspicious pride of a poor man in



<p/>614

<p/>the presence of a rich man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old severity returning as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``The time's past for that, sir. A man should make sacrifices to
keep clear of doing a wrong; sacrifices won't undo it when it's
done. When people's feelings have got a deadly wound, they can't
be cured with favours.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Favours!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>said Arthur, passionately; <div class="bookquote">``no; how can you suppose
I meant that? But the Poysers--Mr. Irwine tells me the Poysers
mean to leave the place where they have lived so many years--for
generations. Don't you see, as Mr. Irwine does, that if they could
be persuaded to overcome the feeling that drives them away, it
would be much better for them in the end to remain on the old
spot, among the friends and neighbours who know them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam coldly. <div class="bookquote">``But then, sir, folks's feelings
are not so easily overcome. It'll be hard for Martin Poyser to go to
a strange place, among strange faces, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)'s been bred up on
the Hall Farm, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) father before him (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>); but then it 'ud be harder
for a man with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feelings to stay. I don't see how the thing's to be
made any other than hard. There's a sort o' damage, sir, that can't
be made up for.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>Arthur was silent some moments. In spite of other feelings
dominant in him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) this evening, his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) pride winced under Adam's
mode of treating him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). Wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) himself suffering? Was not he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) too
obliged to renounce his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) most cherished hopes? It was now as it
had been eight months ago--Adam was forcing Arthur to feel
more intensely the irrevocableness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own wrong-doing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
was presenting the sort of resistance that was the most irritating to
Arthur's eager ardent nature. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) anger was subdued by the
same influence that had subdued Adam's when they first
confronted each other--by the marks of suffering in a long



<p/>615

<p/>familiar face. The momentary struggle ended in the feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
could bear a great deal from Adam, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had been the
occasion of bearing so much; but there was a touch of pleading,
boyish vexation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) tone as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, ``But people may make
injuries worse by unreasonable conduct--by giving way to anger
and satisfying that for the moment, instead of thinking what will
be the effect in the future.
``If I were going to stay here and act as landlord,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) added
presently, with still more eagerness--``if I were careless about
what I've done--what I've been the cause of, you would have some
excuse, Adam, for going away and encouraging others to go. You
would have some excuse then for trying to make the evil worse.
But when I tell you I'm going away for years--when you know
what that means for me, how it cuts off every plan of happiness
I've ever formed--it is impossible for a sensible man like you to
believe that there is any real ground for the Poysers refusing to
remain. I know their feeling about disgrace--Mr. Irwine has told
me all; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) is of opinion that they might be persuaded out of
this idea that they are disgraced in the eyes of their neighbours,
and that they can't remain on my estate, if you would join him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) efforts--if you would stay yourself and go on managing the old
woods.''
Arthur paused a moment and then added, pleadingly, <div class="bookquote">``You
know that's a good work to do for the sake of other people, besides
the owner. And you don't know but that they may have a better
owner soon, whom you will like to work for. If I die, my cousin
Tradgett will have the estate and take my name. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is a good
fellow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Adam could not help being moved: it was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)



<p/>616

<p/>not to feel that this was the voice of the honest warm-hearted
Arthur whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had loved and been proud of in old days; but
nearer memories would not be thrust away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was silent; yet
Arthur saw an answer in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) face that induced him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to go on, with
growing earnestness.
<div class="bookquote">``And then, if you would talk to the Poysers--if you would talk
the matter over with Mr. Irwine--he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) means to see you tomorrow--and then if you would join your arguments to his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) to
prevail on them not to go ... I know, of course, that they would not
accept any favour from me--I mean nothing of that kind--but I'm
sure they would suffer less in the end. Irwine thinks so too. And
Mr. Irwine is to have the chief authority on the estate--he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) has
consented to undertake that. They will really be under no man but
one whom they respect and like. It would be the same with you,
Adam, and it could be nothing but a desire to give me worse pain
that could incline you to go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>Arthur was silent again for a little while, and then said, with
some agitation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't act so towards you, I know.
If you were in my place and I in yours, I should try to help you to
do the best.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>Adam made a hasty movement on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) chair and looked on the
ground. Arthur went on, <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you've never done anything
you've had bitterly to repent of in your life, Adam; if you had, you
would be more generous. You would know then that it's worse for
me than for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div>Arthur rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) seat with the last words, and went to one
of the windows, looking out and turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) back on Adam, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
continued, passionately,
``Haven't I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) too? Didn't I see her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) yesterday? Shan't I



<p/>617

<p/>carry the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) about with me as much as you will? And
don't you think you would suffer more if you'd been in fault?''
There was silence for several minutes, for the struggle in
Adam's mind was not easily decided. Facile natures, whose
emotions have little permanence, can hardly understand how
much inward resistance he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) overcame before he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) seat
and turned towards Arthur. Arthur heard the movement, and
turning round, met the sad but softened look with which Adam
said,
``It's true what you say, sir. I'm hard--it's in my nature. I was
too hard with my father, for doing wrong. I've been a bit hard t'
everybody but her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). I felt as if nobody pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) enough--her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
suffering cut into me so; and when I thought the folks at the farm
were too hard with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), I said I'd never be hard to anybody myself
again. But feeling overmuch about her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has perhaps made me
unfair to you. I've known what it is in my life to repent and feel it's
too late. I felt I'd been too harsh to my father when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was gone
from me--I feel it now, when I think of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I've no right to be
hard towards them as have done wrong and repent.''
Adam spoke these words with the firm distinctness of a man
who is resolved to leave nothing unsaid that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) is bound to say;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) went on with more hesitation.
``I wouldn't shake hands with you once, sir, when you asked
me--but if you're willing to do it now, for all I refused then ... ''
Arthur's white hand was in Adam's large grasp in an instant,
and with that action there was a strong rush, on both sides, of the
old, boyish affection.
``Adam,'' Arthur said, impelled to full confession now, ``it would
never have happened if I'd known you loved her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). That would have



<p/>618

<p/>helped to save me from it. And I did struggle. I never meant to
injure her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). I deceived you afterwards--and that led on to worse;
but I thought it was forced upon me, I thought it was the best
thing I could do. And in that letter I told her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to let me know if she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
were in any trouble: don't think I would not have done everything
I could. But I was all wrong from the very first, and horrible wrong
has come of it. God knows, I'd give my life if I could undo it.''
They sat down again opposite each other, and Adam said,
tremulously, ``How did she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) seem when you left her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), sir?''
``Don't ask me, Adam,'' Arthur said; ``I feel sometimes as if I
should go mad with thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) looks and what she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said to me,
and then, that I couldn't get a full pardon--that I couldn't save her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
from that wretched fate of being transported--that I can do
nothing for her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) all those years; and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) may die under it, and
never know comfort any more.''
``Ah, sir,'' said Adam, for the first time feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) own pain
merged in sympathy for Arthur, ``you and me'll often be thinking
o' the same thing, when we're a long way off one another. I'll pray
God to help you, as I pray him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to help me.''
``But there's that sweet woman--that Dinah Morris,'' Arthur
said, pursuing his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own thoughts and not knowing what had been
the sense of Adam's words, ``she (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) shall stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) to the
very last moment--till she (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) goes; and the poor thing clings to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) found some comfort in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>). I could worship that woman; I
don't know what I should do if she (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) were not there. Adam, you will
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) comes back. I could say nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
yesterday--nothing of what I felt towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>). Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>),'' Arthur
went on hurriedly, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) wanted to hide the emotion with which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) spoke, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) chain and watch, ``tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) I asked



<p/>619

<p/>you to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) this in remembrance of me--of the man to whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) is the one source of comfort, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thinks of ... I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
doesn't care about such things--or anything else I can give her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) for
its own sake. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) will use the watch--I shall like to think of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) using it.''
``I'll give it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), sir,'' Adam said, ``and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) your words. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
told me she (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) should come back to the people at the Hall Farm.''
``And you will persuade the Poysers to stay, Adam?'' said
Arthur, reminded of the subject which both of them had forgotten
in the first interchange of revived friendship. ``You will stay
yourself, and help Mr. Irwine to carry out the repairs and
improvements on the estate?''
``There's one thing, sir, that perhaps you don't take account of,''
said Adam, with hesitating gentleness, ``and that was what made
me hang back longer. You see, it's the same with both me and the
Poysers: if we stay, it's for our own worldly interest, and it looks as
if we'd put up with anything for the sake o' that. I know that's
what they'll feel, and I can't help feeling a little of it myself. When
folks have got an honourable independent spirit, they don't like to
do anything that might make ’em seem base-minded.''
``But no one who knows you will think that, Adam. That is not a
reason strong enough against a course that is really more
generous, more unselfish than the other. And it will be known--it
shall be made known, that both you and the Poysers stayed at my
entreaty. Adam, don't try to make things worse for me; I'm
punished enough without that.''
``No, sir, no,'' Adam said, looking at Arthur with mournful
affection. ``God forbid I should make things worse for you. I used
to wish I could do it, in my passion--but that was when I thought



<p/>620

<p/>you didn't feel enough. I'll stay, sir, I'll do the best I can. It's all I've
got to think of now--to do my work well and make the world a bit
better place for them as can enjoy it.''
``Then we'll part now, Adam. You will see Mr. Irwine tomorrow, and consult with him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) about everything.''
``Are you going soon, sir?'' said Adam.
``As soon as possible--after I've made the necessary
arrangements. Good-bye, Adam. I shall think of you going about
the old place.''
<div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, sir. God bless you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The hands were clasped once more, and Adam left the
Hermitage, feeling that sorrow was more bearable now hatred was
gone.
As soon as the door was closed behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), Arthur went to the
waste-paper basket and took out the little pink silk handkerchief.

<p/>Chapter XLIX
At the Hall Farm

<p/>T

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) first autumnal afternoon sunshine of 1801--more than
eighteen months after that parting of Adam and Arthur in
the Hermitage--was on the yard at the Hall Farm; and the
bull-dog was in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) most excited moments, for it was that
hour of the day when the cows were being driven into the yard for
their afternoon milking. No wonder the patient beasts ran
confusedly into the wrong places, for the alarming din of the bulldog was mingled with more distant sounds which the timid
feminine creatures, with pardonable superstition, imagined also to
have some relation to their own movements--with the tremendous
crack of the waggoner's whip, the roar of his (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>) voice, and the
booming thunder of the waggon, as it left the rick-yard empty of
its golden load.
The milking of the cows was a sight Mrs. Poyser loved, and at
this hour on mild days she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was usually standing at the house door,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) knitting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) hands, in quiet contemplation, only
heightened to a keener interest when the vicious yellow cow, who
had once kicked over a pailful of precious milk, was about to
undergo the preventive punishment of having her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) hinder-legs
strapped.
To-day, however, Mrs. Poyser gave but a divided attention to
the arrival of the cows, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) was in eager discussion with Dinah,
who was stitching Mr. Poyser's shirt-collars, and had borne
patiently to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) thread broken three times by Totty pulling at




<p/>623

<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) arm with a sudden insistence that she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) should look at <div class="bookquote">``Baby,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>that is, at a large wooden doll with no legs and a long skirt, whose
bald head Totty, seated in her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) small chair at Dinah's side, was
caressing and pressing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) fat cheek with much fervour. Totty is
larger by more than two years' growth than when you first saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) has on a black frock under her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) pinafore. Mrs. Poyser
too has on a black gown, which seems to heighten the family
likeness between her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) and Dinah. In other respects there is little
outward change now discernible in our old friends, or in the
pleasant house-place, bright with polished oak and pewter.
<div class="bookquote">``I never saw the like to you, Dinah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Poyser was saying,
<div class="bookquote">``when you've once took anything into your head: there's no more
moving you than the rooted tree. You may say what you like, but I
don't believe that's religion; for what's the Sermon on the Mount
about, as you're so fond o' reading to the boys, but doing what
other folks 'ud have you do? But if it was anything unreasonable
they wanted you to do, like taking your cloak off and giving it to
’em, or letting ’em slap you i' the face, I daresay you'd be ready
enough. It's only when one 'ud have you do what's plain common
sense and good for yourself, as you're obstinate th' other way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nay, dear Aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>said Dinah, smiling slightly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) went on
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) work, <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure your wish 'ud be a reason for me to do
anything that I didn't feel it was wrong to do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>``Wrong! You drive me past bearing. What is there wrong, I
should like to know, i' staying along wi' your own friends, as are
th' happier for having you with ’em an' are willing to provide for
you, even if your work didn't more nor pay ’em for the bit o'
sparrow's victual y' eat and the bit o' rag you put on? An' who is it,
I should like to know, as you're bound t' help and comfort i' the



<p/>624

<p/>world more nor your own flesh and blood--an' me th' only aunt
you've got above-ground, an' am brought to the brink o' the grave
welly every winter as comes, an' there's the child as sits beside you
'ull break her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) little heart when you go, an' the grandfather not
been dead a twelvemonth, an' your uncle 'ull miss you so as never
was--a-lighting his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) pipe an' waiting on him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), an' now I can trust
you wi' the butter, an' have had all the trouble o' teaching you, and
there's all the sewing to be done, an' I must have a strange gell out
o' Treddles'on to do it--an' all because you must go back to that
bare heap o' stones as the very crows fly over an' won't stop at.''
``Dear Aunt Rachel,'' said Dinah, looking up in Mrs. Poyser's
face, ``it's your kindness makes you say I'm useful to you. You
don't really want me now, for Nancy and Molly are clever at their
work, and you're in good health now, by the blessing of God, and
my uncle is of a cheerful countenance again, and you have
neighbours and friends not a few--some of them come to sit with
my uncle almost daily. Indeed, you will not miss me; and at
Snowfield there are brethren and sisters in great need, who have
none of those comforts you have around you. I feel that I am called
back to those amongst whom my lot was first cast. I feel drawn
again towards the hills where I used to be blessed in carrying the
word of life to the sinful and desolate.''
``You feel! yes,'' said Mrs. Poyser, returning from a parenthetic
glance at the cows, ``that's allays the reason I'm to sit down wi',
when you've a mind to do anything contrairy. What do you want to
be preaching for more than you're preaching now? Don't you go
off, the Lord knows where, every Sunday a-preaching and
praying? An' haven't you got Methodists enow at Treddles'on to
go and look at, if church-folks's faces are too handsome to please



<p/>625

<p/>you? An' isn't there them i' this parish as you've got under hand,
and they're like enough to make friends wi' Old Harry again as
soon as your back's turned? There's that Bessy Cranage--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'ll be
flaunting i' new finery three weeks after you're gone, I'll be bound.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'ll no more go on in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) new ways without you than a dog 'ull
stand on its hind-legs when there's nobody looking. But I suppose
it doesna matter so much about folks's souls i' this country, else
you'd be for staying with your own aunt, for she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)'s none so good
but what you might help her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to be better.''
There was a certain something in Mrs. Poyser's voice just then,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) did not wish to be noticed, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) turned round hastily
to look at the clock, and said: ``See there! It's tea-time; an' if
Martin's i' the rick-yard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)'ll like a cup. Here, Totty, my chicken,
let mother put your bonnet on, and then you go out into the rickyard and see if Father's there, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) mustn't go away
again without coming t' have a cup o' tea; and tell your brothers to
come in too.''
Totty trotted off in her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) flapping bonnet, while Mrs. Poyser set
out the bright oak table and reached down the tea-cups.
``You talk o' them gells Nancy and Molly being clever i' their
work,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) began again; <div class="bookquote">``it's fine talking. They're all the same,
clever or stupid--one can't trust ’em out o' one's sight a minute.
They want somebody's eye on ’em constant if they're to be kept to
their work. An' suppose I'm ill again this winter, as I was the
winter before last? Who's to look after ’em then, if you're gone?
An' there's that blessed child--something's sure t' happen to her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)--
they'll let her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) tumble into the fire, or get at the kettle wi' the
boiling lard in't, or some mischief as 'ull lame her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) for life; an' it'll
be all your fault, Dinah.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Molly</b></font>)</div><p/>626

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>said Dinah, <div class="bookquote">``I promise to come back to you in the
winter if you're ill. Don't think I will ever stay away from you if
you're in real want of me. But, indeed, it is needful for my own
soul that I should go away from this life of ease and luxury in
which I have all things too richly to enjoy--at least that I should go
away for a short space. No one can know but myself what are my
inward needs, and the besetments I am most in danger from. Your
wish for me to stay is not a call of duty which I refuse to hearken to
because it is against my own desires; it is a temptation that I must
resist, lest the love of the creature should become like a mist in my
soul shutting out the heavenly light.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It passes my cunning to know what you mean by ease and
luxury,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) cut the bread and butter. <div class="bookquote">``It's
true there's good victual enough about you, as nobody shall ever
say I don't provide enough and to spare, but if there's ever a bit o'
odds an' ends as nobody else 'ud eat, you're sure to pick it out ...
but look there! There's Adam Bede a-carrying the little un in. I
wonder how it is he (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>)'s come so early.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Poyser hastened to the door for the pleasure of looking at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) darling in a new position, with love in her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) eyes but reproof on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) tongue.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh for shame, Totty! Little gells o' five year old should be
ashamed to be carried. Why, Adam, she (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'ll break your arm, such a
big gell as that; set her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) down--for shame!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, <div class="bookquote">``I can lift her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) with my hand--I've no
need to take my arm to it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Totty, looking as serenely unconscious of remark as a fat white
puppy, was set down at the door-place, and the mother enforced
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) reproof with a shower of kisses.



<p/>627

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're surprised to see me at this hour o' the day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, but come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser, making way for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>);
<div class="bookquote">``there's no bad news, I hope?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, nothing bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam answered, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) went up to Dinah
and put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had laid down her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) work and
stood up, instinctively, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). A faint blush died
away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) pale cheek as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) and looked up
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) timidly.
<div class="bookquote">``It's an errand to you brought me, Dinah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam,
apparently unconscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hand all the
while; <div class="bookquote">``mother's a bit ailing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s set her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart on your
coming to stay the night with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), if you'll be so kind. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) I'd
call and ask you as I came from the village. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) overworks herself,
and I can't persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to have a little girl t' help her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). I don't
know what's to be done.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Adam released Dinah's hand as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) ceased speaking, and was
expecting an answer, but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) lips Mrs.
Poyser said, <div class="bookquote">``Look there now! I told you there was folks enow t'
help i' this parish, wi’out going further off. There's Mrs. Bede
getting as old and cas'alty as can be, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) won't let anybody but
you go a-nigh her (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) hardly. The folks at Snowfield have learnt by
this time to do better wi’out you nor she (<font color='blue'><b>Bede</b></font>) can.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll put my bonnet on and set off directly, if you don't want
anything done first, Aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>said Dinah, folding up her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) work.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do want something done. I want you t' have your tea,
child; it's all ready--and you'll have a cup, Adam, if y' arena in too
big a hurry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Yes, I'll have a cup, please; and then I'll walk with Dinah. I'm
going straight home, for I've got a lot o' timber valuations to write



<p/>628

<p/>out.''
``Why, Adam, lad, are you here?'' said Mr. Poyser, entering
warm and coatless, with the two black-eyed boys behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>), still
looking as much like him (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) as two small elephants are like a large
one. ``How is it we've got sight o' you so long before fodderingtime?''
``I came on an errand for Mother,'' said Adam. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s got a
touch of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) old complaint, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) wants Dinah to go and stay
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) a bit.''
``Well, we'll spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) for your mother a little while,'' said Mr.
Poyser. ``But we wonna spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) for anybody else, on'y her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
husband.''
``Husband!'' said Marty, who was at the most prosaic and literal
period of the boyish mind. ``Why, Dinah hasn't got a husband.''
``Spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)?'' said Mrs. Poyser, placing a seed-cake on the table
and then seating herself to pour out the tea. ``But we must spare
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), it seems, and not for a husband neither, but for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) own
megrims. Tommy, what are you doing to your little sister's doll?
Making the child naughty, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'d be good if you'd let her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). You
shanna have a morsel o' cake if you behave so.''
Tommy, with true brotherly sympathy, was amusing himself by
turning Dolly's skirt over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) bald head and exhibiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>)
truncated body to the general scorn--an indignity which cut Totty
to the heart.
``What do you think Dinah's been a-telling me since dinnertime?'' Mrs. Poyser continued, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) husband.
``Eh! I'm a poor un at guessing,'' said Mr. Poyser.
``Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) means to go back to Snowfield again, and work i' the
mill, and starve herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) used to do, like a creatur as has got



<p/>629

<p/>no friends.''
Mr. Poyser did not readily find words to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) unpleasant
astonishment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) only looked from his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) wife to Dinah, who had now
seated herself beside Totty, as a bulwark against brotherly
playfulness, and was busying herself with the children's tea. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
had been given to making general reflections, it would have
occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) that there was certainly a change come over
Dinah, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) never used to change colour; but, as it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
merely observed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) face was flushed at that moment. Mr.
Poyser thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) looked the prettier for it: it was a flush no
deeper than the petal of a monthly rose. Perhaps it came because
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) uncle was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) so fixedly; but there is no knowing,
for just then Adam was saying, with quiet surprise, ``Why, I hoped
Dinah was settled among us for life. I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'d given up the
notion o' going back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) old country.''
``Thought! yes,'' said Mrs. Poyser, ``and so would anybody else
ha' thought, as had got their right end up'ards. But I suppose you
must be a Methodist to know what a Methodist 'ull do. It's ill
guessing what the bats are flying after.''
``Why, what have we done to you. Dinah, as you must go away
from us?'' said Mr. Poyser, still pausing over his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) tea-cup. ``It's like
breaking your word, welly, for your aunt never had no thought but
you'd make this your home.''
``Nay, Uncle,'' said Dinah, trying to be quite calm. ``When I first
came, I said it was only for a time, as long as I could be of any
comfort to my aunt.''
``Well, an' who said you'd ever left off being a comfort to me?''
said Mrs. Poyser. <div class="bookquote">``If you didna mean to stay wi' me, you'd better
never ha' come. Them as ha' never had a cushion don't miss it.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>630

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser, who objected to exaggerated
views. <div class="bookquote">``Thee mustna say so; we should ha' been ill off wi’out her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>),
Lady day was a twelvemont'. We mun be thankful for that,
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) stays or no. But I canna think what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) mun leave a

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, that's just the reason she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) wants to go, as fur as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) can

well pelt a bag o' feathers as talk to ’em. But I say it isna religion,
to be so obstinate--is it now, Adam?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam saw that Dinah was more disturbed than he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had ever
seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) by any matter relating to herself, and, anxious to relieve
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), if possible, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) affectionately, <div class="bookquote">``Nay, I can't
find fault with anything Dinah does. I believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) thoughts are
better than our guesses, let ’em be what they may. I should ha'
been thankful for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) to stay among us, but if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) thinks well to go,
I wouldn't cross her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), or make it hard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) by objecting. We owe
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) something different to that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As it often happens, the words intended to relieve her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) were just
too much for Dinah's susceptible feelings at this moment. The
tears came into the grey eyes too fast to be hidden and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) got up
hurriedly, meaning it to be understood that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was going to put
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) bonnet.
<div class="bookquote">``Mother, what's Dinah crying for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Totty</b></font>)</div>said Totty. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) isn't a
naughty dell.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thee'st gone a bit too fur,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser. ``We've no right t'



<p/>631

<p/>interfere with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) doing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) likes. An' thee'dst be as angry as
could be wi' me, if I said a word against anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) did.''
``Because you'd very like be finding fault wi’out reason,'' said
Mrs. Poyser. ``But there's reason i' what I say, else I shouldna say
it. It's easy talking for them as can't love her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) so well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) own
aunt does. An' me got so used to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)! I shall feel as uneasy as a
new sheared sheep when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s gone from me. An' to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
leaving a parish where she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s so looked on. There's Mr. Irwine
makes as much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was a lady, for all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) being a
Methodist, an' wi' that maggot o' preaching in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) head--God
forgi’e me if I'm i' the wrong to call it so.''
``Aye,'' said Mr. Poyser, looking jocose; ``but thee dostna tell
Adam what he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said to thee about it one day. The missis was
saying, Adam, as the preaching was the only fault to be found wi'
Dinah, and Mr. Irwine says, `But you mustn't find fault with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
for that, Mrs. Poyser; you forget she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)'s got no husband to preach to.
I'll answer for it, you give Poyser many a good sermon.' The
parson had thee there,'' Mr. Poyser added, laughing unctuously. ``I
told Bartle Massey on it, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) laughed too.''
``Yes, it's a small joke sets men laughing when they sit a-staring
at one another with a pipe i' their mouths,'' said Mrs. Poyser.
<div class="bookquote">``Give Bartle Massey his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) way and he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>)'d have all the sharpness to
himself. If the chaff-cutter had the making of us, we should all be
straw, I reckon. Totty, my chicken, go upstairs to cousin Dinah,
and see what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s doing, and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) a pretty kiss.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This errand was devised for Totty as a means of checking
certain threatening symptoms about the corners of the mouth; for
Tommy, no longer expectant of cake, was lifting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) eyelids
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) forefingers and turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) eyeballs towards Totty in a



<p/>632

<p/>way that she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) felt to be disagreeably personal.
<div class="bookquote">``You're rare and busy now--eh, Adam?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser.
<div class="bookquote">``Burge's getting so bad wi' his (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) asthmy, it's well if he (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>)'ll ever do
much riding about again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, we've got a pretty bit o' building on hand now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said
Adam, <div class="bookquote">``what with the repairs on th' estate, and the new houses at
Treddles'on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll bet a penny that new house Burge is building on his (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) own
bit o' land is for him (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) and Mary to go to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>)'ll be
for laying by business soon, I'll warrant, and be wanting you to
take to it all and pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Burge</b></font>) so much by th' 'ear. We shall see you
living on th' hill before another twelvemont's over.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, <div class="bookquote">``I should like t' have the business in my
own hands. It isn't as I mind much about getting any more money.
We've enough and to spare now, with only our two selves and
mother; but I should like t' have my own way about things--I
could try plans then, as I can't do now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You get on pretty well wi' the new steward, I reckon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Poyser.
``Yes, yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>)'s a sensible man enough; understands farming--
he (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>)'s carrying on the draining, and all that, capital. You must go
some day towards the Stonyshire side and see what alterations
they're making. But he (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>)'s got no notion about buildings. You can so
seldom get hold of a man as can turn his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brains to more nor one
thing; it's just as if they wore blinkers like th' horses and could see
nothing o' one side of ’em. Now, there's Mr. Irwine has got notions
o' building more nor most architects; for as for th' architects, they
set up to be fine fellows, but the most of ’em don't know where to
set a chimney so as it shan't be quarrelling with a door. My notion



<p/>633

<p/>is, a practical builder that's got a bit o' taste makes the best
architect for common things; and I've ten times the pleasure i'
seeing after the work when I've made the plan myself.''
Mr. Poyser listened with an admiring interest to Adam's
discourse on building, but perhaps it suggested to him (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) that the
building of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) corn-rick had been proceeding a little too long
without the control of the master's eye, for when Adam had done
speaking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) got up and said, ``Well, lad, I'll bid you good-bye now,
for I'm off to the rick-yard again.''
Adam rose too, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) saw Dinah entering, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) bonnet on
and a little basket in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hand, preceded by Totty.
``You're ready, I see, Dinah,'' Adam said; ``so we'll set off, for the
sooner I'm at home the better.''
``Mother,'' said Totty, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) treble pipe, ``Dinah was saying
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) prayers and crying ever so.''
``Hush, hush,'' said the mother, ``little gells mustn't chatter.''
Whereupon the father, shaking with silent laughter, set Totty
on the white deal table and desired her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). Mr. and Mrs.
Poyser, you perceive, had no correct principles of education.
``Come back to-morrow if Mrs. Bede doesn't want you, Dinah,''
said Mrs. Poyser: <div class="bookquote">``but you can stay, you know, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s ill.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>So, when the good-byes had been said, Dinah and Adam left the
Hall Farm together.




<p/>634

<p/>Chapter L
In the Cottage

<p/>A

<p/>dam did not ask Dinah to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) arm when they got out
into the lane. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had never yet done so, often as they had
walked together, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) never
walked arm-in-arm with Seth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) thought, perhaps, that kind
of support was not agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). So they walked apart, though
side by side, and the close poke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) little black bonnet hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
face from him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``You can't be happy, then, to make the Hall Farm your home,
Dinah?''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam said, with the quiet interest of a brother, who has
no anxiety for himself in the matter. <div class="bookquote">``It's a pity, seeing they're so
fond of you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You know, Adam, my heart is as their heart, so far as love for
them and care for their welfare goes, but they are in no present
need. Their sorrows are healed, and I feel that I am called back to
my old work, in which I found a blessing that I have missed of late
in the midst of too abundant worldly good. I know it is a vain
thought to flee from the work that God appoints us, for the sake of
finding a greater blessing to our own souls, as if we could choose
for ourselves where we shall find the fulness of the Divine
Presence, instead of seeking it where alone it is to be found, in
loving obedience. But now, I believe, I have a clear showing that
my work lies elsewhere--at least for a time. In the years to come, if
my aunt's health should fail, or she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) should otherwise need me, I
shall return.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>635

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know best, Dinah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam. <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe you'd go
against the wishes of them that love you, and are akin to you,
without a good and sufficient reason in your own conscience. I've
no right to say anything about my being sorry: you know well
enough what cause I have to put you above every other friend I've
got; and if it had been ordered so that you could ha' been my
sister, and lived with us all our lives, I should ha' counted it the
greatest blessing as could happen to us now. But Seth tells me
there's no hope o' that: your feelings are different, and perhaps
I'm taking too much upon me to speak about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>Dinah made no answer, and they walked on in silence for some
yards, till they came to the stone stile, where, as Adam had passed
through first and turned round to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hand while she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
mounted the unusually high step, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) could not prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) from
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) face. It struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) with surprise, for the grey eyes,
usually so mild and grave, had the bright uneasy glance which
accompanies suppressed agitation, and the slight flush in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
cheeks, with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had come downstairs, was heightened to a
deep rose-colour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) were only sister to Dinah.
Adam was silent with surprise and conjecture for some moments,
and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I hope I've not hurt or displeased you by what
I've said, Dinah. Perhaps I was making too free. I've no wish
different from what you see to be best, and I'm satisfied for you to
live thirty mile off, if you think it right. I shall think of you just as
much as I do now, for you're bound up with what I can no more
help remembering than I can help my heart beating.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Poor Adam! Thus do men blunder. Dinah made no answer, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) presently said, <div class="bookquote">``Have you heard any news from that poor
young man, since we last spoke of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''



 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>636

<p/>Dinah always called Arthur so; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had never lost the image of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) in the prison.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam. ``Mr. Irwine read me part of a letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)
yesterday. It's pretty certain, they say, that there'll be a peace
soon, though nobody believes it'll last long; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) doesn't
mean to come home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)'s no heart for it yet, and it's better for
others that he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) should keep away. Mr. Irwine thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)'s in the
right not to come. It's a sorrowful letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) asks about you and the
Poysers, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) always does. There's one thing in the letter cut me a
good deal: `You can't think what an old fellow I feel,' he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) says; `I
make no schemes now. I'm the best when I've a good day's march
or fighting before me.'''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s of a rash, warm-hearted nature, like Esau, for whom I
have always felt great pity,'' said Dinah. ``That meeting between
the brothers, where Esau is so loving and generous, and Jacob so
timid and distrustful, notwithstanding his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) sense of the Divine
favour, has always touched me greatly. Truly, I have been tempted
sometimes to say that Jacob was of a mean spirit. But that is our
trial: we must learn to see the good in the midst of much that is
unlovely.''
``Ah,'' said Adam, <div class="bookquote">``I like to read about Moses best, in th' Old
Testament. He (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) carried a hard business well through, and died
when other folks were going to reap the fruits. A man must have
courage to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life so, and think what'll come of it after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s
dead and gone. A good solid bit o' work lasts: if it's only laying a
floor down, somebody's the better for it being done well, besides
the man as does it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Willow</b></font>)</div>They were both glad to talk of subjects that were not personal,
and in this way they went on till they passed the bridge across the



<p/>637

<p/>Willow Brook, when Adam turned round and said, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, here's
Seth. I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)'d be home soon. Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) know of you're going,
Dinah?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) last Sabbath.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam remembered now that Seth had come home much
depressed on Sunday evening, a circumstance which had been
very unusual with him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) of late, for the happiness he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had in seeing
Dinah every week seemed long to have outweighed the pain of
knowing she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would never marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>). This evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)
habitual air of dreamy benignant contentment, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) came quite
close to Dinah and saw the traces of tears on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) delicate eyelids
and eyelashes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) gave one rapid glance at his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) brother, but Adam
was evidently quite outside the current of emotion that had
shaken Dinah: he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) everyday look of unexpectant calm.
Seth tried not to let Dinah see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) face, and
only said, <div class="bookquote">``I'm thankful you're come, Dinah, for Mother's been
hungering after the sight of you all day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) began to talk of you
the first thing in the morning.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>When they entered the cottage, Lisbeth was seated in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) armchair, too tired with setting out the evening meal, a task she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>)
always performed a long time beforehand, to go and meet them at
the door as usual, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) heard the approaching footsteps.
<div class="bookquote">``Coom, child, thee 't coom at last,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) said, when Dinah went
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What dost mane by lavin' me a week an' ne’er
coomin' a-nigh me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dear friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>said Dinah, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``you're not well. If
I'd known it sooner, I'd have come.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>``An' how's thee t' know if thee dostna coom? Th' lads on'y
know what I tell ’em. As long as ye can stir hand and foot the men



<p/>638

<p/>think ye're hearty. But I'm none so bad, on'y a bit of a cold sets me
achin'. An' th' lads tease me so t' ha' somebody wi' me t' do the
work--they make me ache worse wi' talkin'. If thee'dst come and
stay wi' me, they'd let me alone. The Poysers canna want thee so
bad as I do. But take thy bonnet off, an' let me look at thee.''
Dinah was moving away, but Lisbeth held her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) fast, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
was taking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) bonnet, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) face as one looks into
a newly gathered snowdrop, to renew the old impressions of purity
and gentleness.
``What's the matter wi' thee?'' said Lisbeth, in astonishment;
``thee'st been a-cryin'.''
``It's only a grief that'll pass away,'' said Dinah, who did not
wish just now to call forth Lisbeth's remonstrances by disclosing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) intention to leave Hayslope. <div class="bookquote">``You shall know about it shortly--
we'll talk of it to-night. I shall stay with you to-night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Lisbeth was pacified by this prospect. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) had the whole
evening to talk with Dinah alone; for there was a new room in the
cottage, you remember, built nearly two years ago, in the
expectation of a new inmate; and here Adam always sat when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
had writing to do or plans to make. Seth sat there too this evening,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) mother would like to have Dinah all to herself.
There were two pretty pictures on the two sides of the wall in
the cottage. On one side there was the broad-shouldered, largefeatured, hardy old woman, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) blue jacket and buff kerchief,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dim-eyed anxious looks turned continually on the lily face
and the slight form in the black dress that were either moving
lightly about in helpful activity, or seated close by the old woman's
arm-chair, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) withered hand, with eyes lifted up towards
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to speak a language which Lisbeth understood far better than



<p/>639

<p/>the Bible or the hymn-book. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) would scarcely listen to reading
at all to-night. <div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay, shut the book,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We mun talk. I
want t' know what thee was cryin' about. Hast got troubles o' thy
own, like other folks?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the brothers Adam</b></font>)</div>On the other side of the wall there were the two brothers so like
each other in the midst of their unlikeness: Adam with knit brows,
shaggy hair, and dark vigorous colour, absorbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``figuring'' (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>;
Seth, with large rugged features, the close copy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) brother's,
but with thin, wavy, brown hair and blue dreamy eyes, as often as
not looking vaguely out of the window instead of at his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) book,
although it was a newly bought book--Wesley's abridgment of
Madame Guyon's life, which was full of wonder and interest for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wesley</b></font>). Seth had said to Adam, <div class="bookquote">``Can I help thee with anything in
here to-night? I don't want to make a noise in the shop.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam answered, <div class="bookquote">``there's nothing but what I must do
myself. Thee'st got thy new book to read.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>And often, when Seth was quite unconscious, Adam, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
paused after drawing a line with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) ruler, looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) brother
with a kind smile dawning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) knew <div class="bookquote">``th' lad liked to sit
full o' thoughts he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) could give no account of; they'd never come t'
anything, but they made him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and in the last year or so,
Adam had been getting more and more indulgent to Seth. It was
part of that growing tenderness which came from the sorrow at
work within him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>).
For Adam, though you see him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) quite master of himself, working
hard and delighting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) work after his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) inborn inalienable
nature, had not outlived his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) sorrow--had not felt it slip from him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
as a temporary burden, and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) the same man again. Do any
of us? God forbid. It would be a poor result of all our anguish and



<p/>640

<p/>our wrestling if we won nothing but our old selves at the end of
it--if we could return to the same blind loves, the same selfconfident blame, the same light thoughts of human suffering, the
same frivolous gossip over blighted human lives, the same feeble
sense of that Unknown towards which we have sent forth
irrepressible cries in our loneliness. Let us rather be thankful that
our sorrow lives in us as an indestructible force, only changing its
form, as forces do, and passing from pain into sympathy--the one
poor word which includes all our best insight and our best love.
Not that this transformation of pain into sympathy had completely
taken place in Adam yet. There was still a great remnant of pain,
and this he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) felt would subsist as long as her (<font color='blue'><b>remnant</b></font>) pain was not a
memory, but an existing thing, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) must think of as renewed
with the light of every new morning. But we get accustomed to
mental as well as bodily pain, without, for all that, losing our
sensibility to it. It becomes a habit of our lives, and we cease to
imagine a condition of perfect ease as possible for us. Desire is
chastened into submission, and we are contented with our day
when we have been able to bear our grief in silence and act as if
we were not suffering. For it is at such periods that the sense of
our lives having visible and invisible relations, beyond any of
which either our present or prospective self is the centre, grows
like a muscle that we are obliged to lean on and exert.
That was Adam's state of mind in this second autumn of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
sorrow. His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) work, as you know, had always been part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
religion, and from very early days he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) saw clearly that good
carpentry was God's will--was that form of God's will that most
immediately concerned him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). But now there was no margin of
dreams for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) beyond this daylight reality, no holiday-time in the



<p/>641

<p/>working-day world, no moment in the distance when duty would
take off her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) iron glove and breast-plate and clasp him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) gently into
rest. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) conceived no picture of the future but one made up of
hard-working days such as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lived through, with growing
contentment and intensity of interest, every fresh week. Love, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
thought, could never be anything to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) but a living memory--a
limb lopped off, but not gone from consciousness. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did not know
that the power of loving was all the while gaining new force within
him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); that the new sensibilities bought by a deep experience were
so many new fibres by which it was possible, nay, necessary to
him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), that his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) nature should intertwine with another. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was
aware that common affection and friendship were more precious
to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) than they used to be--that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) clung more to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mother and
Seth, and had an unspeakable satisfaction in the sight or
imagination of any small addition to their happiness. The Poysers,
too--hardly three or four days passed but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt the need of
seeing them and interchanging words and looks of friendliness
with them. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would have felt this, probably, even if Dinah had
not been with them, but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had only said the simplest truth in
telling Dinah that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) above all other friends in the world.
Could anything be more natural? For in the darkest moments of
memory the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) always came as the first ray of
returning comfort. The early days of gloom at the Hall Farm had
been gradually turned into soft moonlight by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) presence; and in
the cottage, too, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had come at every spare moment to soothe
and cheer poor Lisbeth, who had been stricken with a fear that
subdued even her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) querulousness at the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) darling
Adam's grief-worn face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had become used to watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) light
quiet movements, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) pretty loving ways to the children, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)



<p/>642

<p/>went to the Hall Farm; to listen for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) voice as for a recurrent
music; to think everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) said and did was just right, and
could not have been better. In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) wisdom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could not
find fault with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) overindulgence of the children, who had
managed to convert Dinah the preacher, before whom a circle of
rough men had often trembled a little, into a convenient
household slave--though Dinah herself was rather ashamed of
this weakness, and had some inward conflict as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) departure
from the precepts of Solomon. Yes, there was one thing that might
have been better; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) might have loved Seth and consented to
marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) felt a little vexed, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) brother's sake, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)
could not help thinking regretfully how Dinah, as Seth's wife,
would have made their home as happy as it could be for them all--
how she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was the one being that would have soothed their mother's
last days into peacefulness and rest.
<div class="bookquote">``It's wonderful she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) doesn't love th' lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam had said
sometimes to himself, ``for anybody 'ud think he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was just cut out
for her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>). But her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) heart's so taken up with other things. She (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>)'s one o'
those women that feel no drawing towards having a husband and
children o' their own. She (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) should be filled up with her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>)
own life then, and she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>)'s been used so to living in other folks's
cares, she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) can't bear the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) heart being shut up from
’em. I see how it is, well enough. She (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>)'s cut out o' different stuff
from most women: I saw that long ago. She (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>)'s never easy but when
she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>)'s helping somebody, and marriage 'ud interfere with her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>)
ways--that's true. I've no right to be contriving and thinking it 'ud
be better if she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>)'d have Seth, as if I was wiser than she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) is--or than
God either, for He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) is, and that's one o' the
greatest blessings I've ever had from His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands, and others



<p/>643

<p/>besides me.''
This self-reproof had recurred strongly to Adam's mind when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) gathered from Dinah's face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had wounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) by
referring to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) wish that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had accepted Seth, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had
endeavoured to put into the strongest words his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) confidence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
decision as right--his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) resignation even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) going away from
them and ceasing to make part of their life otherwise than by
living in their thoughts, if that separation were chosen by herself.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) felt sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) knew quite well enough how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) cared to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) continually--to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) with the silent consciousness of a
mutual great remembrance. It was not possible she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) should hear
anything but self-renouncing affection and respect in his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)
assurance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) was contented for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) to go away; and yet there
remained an uneasy feeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had not said quite
the right thing--that, somehow, Dinah had not understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>).
Dinah must have risen a little before the sun the next morning,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was downstairs about five o’clock. So was Seth, for,
through Lisbeth's obstinate refusal to have any woman-helper in
the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had learned to make himself, as Adam said, <div class="bookquote">``very
handy in the housework,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) might save his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother from too
great weariness; on which ground I hope you will not think him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
unmanly, any more than you can have thought the gallant Colonel
Bath unmanly when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) made the gruel for his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) invalid sister.
Adam, who had sat up late at his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) writing, was still asleep, and was
not likely, Seth said, to be down till breakfast-time. Often as Dinah
had visited Lisbeth during the last eighteen months, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had never
slept in the cottage since that night after Thias's death, when, you
remember, Lisbeth praised her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) deft movements and even gave a
modified approval to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) porridge. But in that long interval Dinah



<p/>644

<p/>had made great advances in household cleverness, and this
morning, since Seth was there to help, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was bent on bringing
everything to a pitch of cleanliness and order that would have
satisfied her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) Aunt Poyser. The cottage was far from that standard
at present, for Lisbeth's rheumatism had forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) to give up her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>)
old habits of dilettante scouring and polishing. When the kitchen
was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) mind, Dinah went into the new room, where Adam had
been writing the night before, to see what sweeping and dusting
were needed there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) opened the window and let in the fresh
morning air, and the smell of the sweet-brier, and the bright lowslanting rays of the early sun, which made a glory about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) pale
face and pale auburn hair as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) held the long brush, and swept,
singing to herself in a very low tone--like a sweet summer
murmur that you have to listen for very closely--one of Charles
Wesley's hymns:
``Eternal Beam of Light Divine,
Fountain of unexhausted love,
In whom the Father's glories shine,
Through earth beneath and heaven above;
Jesus! the weary wanderer's rest,
Give me thy easy yoke to bear;
With steadfast patience arm my breast,
With spotless love and holy fear.
Speak to my warring passions, ``Peace!''
Say to my trembling heart, <div class="bookquote">``Be still!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Thy power my strength and fortress is,



<p/>645

<p/>For all things serve thy sovereign will.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) laid by the brush and took up the duster; and if you had
ever lived in Mrs. Poyser's household, you would know how the
duster behaved in Dinah's hand--how it went into every small
corner, and on every ledge in and out of sight--how it went again
and again round every bar of the chairs, and every leg, and under
and over everything that lay on the table, till it came to Adam's
papers and rulers and the open desk near them. Dinah dusted up
to the very edge of these and then hesitated, looking at them with
a longing but timid eye. It was painful to see how much dust there
was among them. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was looking in this way, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) heard Seth's
step just outside the open door, towards which her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) back was
turned, and said, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) clear treble,
<div class="bookquote">``Seth, is your brother wrathful when his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) papers are stirred?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very, when they are not put back in the right places,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>said
a deep strong voice, not Seth's.
It was as if Dinah had put her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hands unawares on a vibrating
chord. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was shaken with an intense thrill, and for the instant
felt nothing else; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) cheeks were glowing, and
dared not look round, but stood still, distressed because she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) could
not say good-morning in a friendly way. Adam, finding that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
did not look round so as to see the smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) face, was afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
had thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) serious about his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) wrathfulness, and went up to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was obliged to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``What! You think I'm a cross fellow at home, Dinah?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said,
smilingly.
<div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>said Dinah, looking up with timid eyes, ``not so. But you
might be put about by finding things meddled with; and even the



<p/>646

<p/>man Moses, the meekest of men, was wrathful sometimes.''
``Come, then,'' said Adam, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) affectionately, ``I'll
help you move the things, and put ’em back again, and then they
can't get wrong. You're getting to be your aunt's own niece, I see,
for particularness.''
They began their little task together, but Dinah had not
recovered herself sufficiently to think of any remark, and Adam
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) uneasily. Dinah, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought, had seemed to
disapprove him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) somehow lately; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had not been so kind and
open to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) used to be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), and
be as pleased as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was himself with doing this bit of playful work.
But Dinah did not look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)--it was easy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) to avoid looking
at the tall man--and when at last there was no more dusting to be
done and no further excuse for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to linger near her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could
bear it no longer, and said, in rather a pleading tone, ``Dinah,
you're not displeased with me for anything, are you? I've not said
or done anything to make you think ill of me?''
The question surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), and relieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) by giving a new
course to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) feeling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now, quite earnestly,
almost with the tears coming, and said, ``Oh, no, Adam! how could
you think so?''
``I couldn't bear you not to feel as much a friend to me as I do to
you,'' said Adam. ``And you don't know the value I set on the very
thought of you, Dinah. That was what I meant yesterday, when I
said I'd be content for you to go, if you thought right. I meant, the
thought of you was worth so much to me, I should feel I ought to
be thankful, and not grumble, if you see right to go away. You
know I do mind parting with you, Dinah?''
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Dinah, trembling, but trying to speak



<p/>647

<p/>calmly, <div class="bookquote">``I know you have a brother's heart towards me, and we
shall often be with one another in spirit; but at this season I am in
heaviness through manifold temptations. You must not mark me. I
feel called to leave my kindred for a while; but it is a trial--the
flesh is weak.''
 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>Adam saw that it pained her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) to be obliged to answer.
<div class="bookquote">``I hurt you by talking about it, Dinah,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'll say no
more. Let's see if Seth's ready with breakfast now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>reader</b></font>)</div>That is a simple scene, reader. But it is almost certain that you,
too, have been in love--perhaps, even, more than once, though
you may not choose to say so to all your feminine friends. If so, you
will no more think the slight words, the timid looks, the tremulous
touches, by which two human souls approach each other
gradually, like two little quivering rain-streams, before they
mingle into one--you will no more think these things trivial than
you will think the first-detected signs of coming spring trivial,
though they be but a faint indescribable something in the air and
in the song of the birds, and the tiniest perceptible budding on the
hedge-row branches. Those slight words and looks and touches
are part of the soul's language; and the finest language, I believe,
is chiefly made up of unimposing words, such as <div class="bookquote">``light,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``sound,''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``stars,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``music'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--words really not worth looking at, or hearing, in
themselves, any more than <div class="bookquote">``chips''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``sawdust.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>It is only that
they happen to be the signs of something unspeakably great and
beautiful. I am of opinion that love is a great and beautiful thing
too, and if you agree with me, the smallest signs of it will not be
chips and sawdust to you: they will rather be like those little
words, <div class="bookquote">``light''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``music,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>stirring the long-winding fibres of
your memory and enriching your present with your most precious



<p/>648

<p/>past.




<p/>649

<p/>Chapter LI
Sunday Morning

<p/>L

<p/>isbeth's touch of rheumatism could not be made to appear
serious enough to detain Dinah another night from the
Hall Farm, now she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) mind to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
aunt so soon, and at evening the friends must part. <div class="bookquote">``For a long
while,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>Dinah had said, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had told Lisbeth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) resolve.
<div class="bookquote">``Then it'll be for all my life, an' I shall ne’er see thee again,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Lisbeth. <div class="bookquote">``Long while! I’n got no long while t' live. An' I shall
be took bad an' die, an' thee canst ne’er come a-nigh me, an' I shall
die a-longing for thee.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That had been the key-note of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) wailing talk all day; for Adam
was not in the house, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) put no restraint on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>)
complaining. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) had tried poor Dinah by returning again and
again to the question, why she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) must go away; and refusing to
accept reasons, which seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) nothing but whim and
<div class="bookquote">``contrairiness'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; and still more, by regretting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``couldna' ha'
one o' the lads''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and be her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) daughter.
<div class="bookquote">``Thee couldstna put up wi' Seth,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) said. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) isna cliver
enough for thee, happen, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)'d ha' been very good t' thee--he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)'s
as handy as can be at doin' things for me when I'm bad, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)'s as
fond o' the Bible an' chappellin' as thee art thysen. But happen,
thee'dst like a husband better as isna just the cut o' thysen: the
runnin' brook isna athirst for th' rain. Adam 'ud ha' done for
thee--I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would--an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) might come t' like thee well
enough, if thee'dst stop. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'s as stubborn as th' iron bar--



<p/>650

<p/>there's no bending him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) no way but 's own. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'d be a fine
husband for anybody, be they who they will, so looked-on an' so
cliver as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) is. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'d be rare an' lovin': it does me good on'y a
look o' the lad's eye when he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) means kind tow'rt me.''
Dinah tried to escape from Lisbeth's closest looks and questions
by finding little tasks of housework that kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) moving about,
and as soon as Seth came home in the evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
bonnet to go. It touched Dinah keenly to say the last good-bye, and
still more to look round on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) way across the fields and see the
old woman still standing at the door, gazing after her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) till she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must
have been the faintest speck in the dim aged eyes. ``The God of
love and peace be with them,'' Dinah prayed, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) looked back
from the last stile. ``Make them glad according to the days wherein
thou hast afflicted them, and the years wherein they have seen
evil. It is thy will that I should part from them; let me have no will
but thine.''
Lisbeth turned into the house at last and sat down in the
workshop near Seth, who was busying himself there with fitting
some bits of turned wood he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) had brought from the village into a
small work-box, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) meant to give to Dinah before she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) went
away.
``Thee 't see her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) again o' Sunday afore she (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) goes,'' were her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) first
words. ``If thee wast good for anything, thee'dst make her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) come in
again o' Sunday night wi' thee, and see me once more.''
``Nay, Mother,'' said Seth. ``Dinah 'ud be sure to come again if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) saw right to come. I should have no need to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
only thinks it 'ud be troubling thee for nought, just to come in to
say good-bye over again.''
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'d ne’er go away, I know, if Adam 'ud be fond on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) an'



<p/>651

<p/>marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), but everything's so contrairy,'' said Lisbeth, with a
burst of vexation.
Seth paused a moment and looked up, with a slight blush, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)
mother's face. ``What! Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) said anything o' that sort to thee,
Mother?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) said, in a lower tone.
``Said? Nay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'ll say nothin'. It's on'y the men as have to wait
till folks say things afore they find ’em out.''
``Well, but what makes thee think so, Mother? What's put it into
thy head?''
``It's no matter what's put it into my head. My head's none so
hollow as it must get in, an' nought to put it there. I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s
fond on him (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>), as I know th' wind's comin' in at the door, an' that's
anoof. An' he (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) might be willin' to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) know'd she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s fond
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>)'ll ne’er think on't if somebody doesna put it into's
head.''
His (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) mother's suggestion about Dinah's feeling towards Adam
was not quite a new thought to Seth, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) last words alarmed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>), lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) should herself undertake to open Adam's eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
was not sure about Dinah's feeling, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was sure
about Adam's.
``Nay, Mother, nay,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, earnestly, ``thee mustna think o'
speaking o' such things to Adam. Thee'st no right to say what
Dinah's feelings are if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hasna told thee, and it 'ud do nothing
but mischief to say such things to Adam. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) feels very grateful and
affectionate toward Dinah, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'s no thoughts towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) that
'ud incline him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) wife, and I don't believe Dinah 'ud
marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) either. I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'ll marry at all.''
``Eh,'' said Lisbeth, impatiently. ``Thee think'st so ’cause she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
wouldna ha' thee. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'ll ne’er marry thee; thee mightst as well like



<p/>652

<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) t' ha' thy brother.''
Seth was hurt. ``Mother,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) said, in a remonstrating tone,
``don't think that of me. I should be as thankful t' have her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) for a
sister as thee wouldst t' have her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) for a daughter. I've no more
thoughts about myself in that thing, and I shall take it hard if ever
thee say'st it again.''
``Well, well, then thee shouldstna cross me wi' sayin' things
arena as I say they are.''
``But, Mother,'' said Seth, ``thee'dst be doing Dinah a wrong by
telling Adam what thee think'st about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). It 'ud do nothing but
mischief, for it 'ud make Adam uneasy if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) doesna feel the same
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). And I'm pretty sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) feels nothing o' the sort.''
``Eh, donna tell me what thee 't sure on; thee know'st nought
about it. What's he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) allays goin' to the Poysers' for, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) didna want
t' see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) goes twice where he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) used t' go once. Happen he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
knowsna as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) wants t' see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) knowsna as I put salt in's broth,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'d miss it pretty quick if it warna there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'ll ne’er think o'
marrying if it isna put into's head, an' if thee'dst any love for thy
mother, thee'dst put him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) up to 't an' not let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) go away out o' my
sight, when I might ha' her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to make a bit o' comfort for me afore I
go to bed to my old man under the white thorn.''
``Nay, Mother,'' said Seth, ``thee mustna think me unkind, but I
should be going against my conscience if I took upon me to say
what Dinah's feelings are. And besides that, I think I should give
offence to Adam by speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) at all about marrying; and I
counsel thee not to do 't. Thee may'st be quite deceived about
Dinah. Nay, I'm pretty sure, by words she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) said to me last Sabbath,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s no mind to marry.''
<div class="bookquote">``Eh, thee 't as contrairy as the rest on ’em. If it war summat I



<p/>653

<p/>didna want, it 'ud be done fast enough.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Lisbeth rose from the bench at this, and went out of the
workshop, leaving Seth in much anxiety lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) should disturb
Adam's mind about Dinah. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) consoled himself after a time with
reflecting that, since Adam's trouble, Lisbeth had been very timid
about speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) on matters of feeling, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) would
hardly dare to approach this tenderest of all subjects. Even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>)
did, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hoped Adam would not take much notice of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) said.
Seth was right in believing that Lisbeth would be held in
restraint by timidity, and during the next three days, the intervals
in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) had an opportunity of speaking to Adam were too
rare and short to cause her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) any strong temptation. But in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) long
solitary hours she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) brooded over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) regretful thoughts about
Dinah, till they had grown very near that point of unmanageable
strength when thoughts are apt to take wing out of their secret
nest in a startling manner. And on Sunday morning, when Seth
went away to chapel at Treddleston, the dangerous opportunity
came.
Sunday morning was the happiest time in all the week to
Lisbeth, for as there was no service at Hayslope church till the
afternoon, Adam was always at home, doing nothing but reading,
an occupation in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) could venture to interrupt him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>).
Moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) had always a better dinner than usual to prepare
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) sons--very frequently for Adam and herself alone, Seth
being often away the entire day--and the smell of the roast meat
before the clear fire in the clean kitchen, the clock ticking in a
peaceful Sunday manner, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) darling Adam seated near her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
best clothes, doing nothing very important, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) could go
and stroke her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) hand across his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hair if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) liked, and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) look



<p/>654

<p/>up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) and smile, while Gyp, rather jealous, poked his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) muzzle
up between them--all these things made poor Lisbeth's earthly
paradise.
The book Adam most often read on a Sunday morning was his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
large pictured Bible, and this morning it lay open before him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) on
the round white deal table in the kitchen; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) sat there in spite
of the fire, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother liked to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),
and it was the only day in the week when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could indulge her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in
that way. You would have liked to see Adam reading his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) Bible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
never opened it on a weekday, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) came to it as a holiday
book, serving him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) for history, biography, and poetry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) held one
hand thrust between his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) waistcoat buttons, and the other ready to
turn the pages, and in the course of the morning you would have
seen many changes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) face. Sometimes his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) lips moved in semiarticulation--it was when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) came to a speech that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could fancy
himself uttering, such as Samuel's dying speech to the people;
then his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) eyebrows would be raised, and the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) mouth
would quiver a little with sad sympathy--something, perhaps old
Isaac's meeting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) son, touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) closely; at other times,
over the New Testament, a very solemn look would come upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>)
face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) would every now and then shake his (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) head in serious
assent, or just lift up his (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) hand and let it fall again. And on some
mornings, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) read in the Apocrypha, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) was very
fond, the son of Sirach's keen-edged words would bring a
delighted smile, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) also enjoyed the freedom of
occasionally differing from an Apocryphal writer. For Adam knew
the Articles quite well, as became a good churchman.
Lisbeth, in the pauses of attending to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) dinner, always sat
opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), till she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) could rest no longer



<p/>655

<p/>without going up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) and giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) a caress, to call his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>). This morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was reading the Gospel
according to St. Matthew, and Lisbeth had been standing close by
him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) for some minutes, stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) hair, which was smoother than
usual this morning, and looking down at the large page with silent
wonderment at the mystery of letters. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) was encouraged to
continue this caress, because when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) first went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)
had thrown himself back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) chair to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) affectionately
and say, <div class="bookquote">``Why, Mother, thee look'st rare and hearty this morning.
Eh, Gyp wants me t' look at him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) can't abide to think I love
thee the best.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Lisbeth said nothing, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) wanted to say so
many things. And now there was a new leaf to be turned over, and
it was a picture--that of the angel seated on the great stone that
has been rolled away from the sepulchre. This picture had one
strong association in Lisbeth's memory, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) had been
reminded of it when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) first saw Dinah, and Adam had no sooner
turned the page, and lifted the book sideways that they might look
at the angel, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``That's her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)--that's Dinah.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Adam smiled, and, looking more intently at the angel's face,
said, <div class="bookquote">``It is a bit like her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>); but Dinah's prettier, I think.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the angel</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, if thee think'st her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) so pretty, why arn't fond on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam looked up in surprise. <div class="bookquote">``Why, Mother, dost think I don't
set store by Dinah?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Lisbeth, frightened at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) own courage, yet feeling
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) had broken the ice, and the waters must flow, whatever
mischief they might do. <div class="bookquote">``What's th' use o' settin' store by things as
are thirty mile off? If thee wast fond enough on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), thee

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>656

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I've no right t' hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) thinks well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam,
looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) book as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) wanted to go on reading. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) foresaw a
series of complaints tending to nothing. Lisbeth sat down again in
the chair opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) said:
<div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) wouldna think well if thee wastna so contrairy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Lisbeth dared not venture beyond a vague phrase yet.
<div class="bookquote">``Contrairy, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam said, looking up again in some
anxiety. <div class="bookquote">``What have I done? What dost mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What hast got i' thy mind, Mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, vexed at this
whimpering. <div class="bookquote">``I canna see what thee't driving at. Is there anything
I could do for thee as I don't do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye, an' that there is. Thee might'st do as I should ha'

my own coffin afore I die, nor ha' them folks to put me in.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam was silent, and tried to go on reading. That was the



<p/>657

<p/>utmost severity he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could show towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother on a Sunday
morning. But Lisbeth had gone too far now to check herself, and
after scarcely a minute's quietness she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) began again.
<div class="bookquote">``Thee mightst know well enough who 'tis I'd like t' ha' wi' me.
It isna many folks I send for t' come an' see me. I reckon. An'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thee mean'st Dinah, Mother, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam. <div class="bookquote">``But it's no

house, where they hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) like a daughter, and where she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s more
bound than she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) is to us. If it had been so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) could ha'
married Seth, that 'ud ha' been a great blessing to us, but we can't
have things just as we like in this life. Thee must try and make up

bein' a Methody! It 'ud happen wear out on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) wi' marryin'.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam threw himself back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) chair and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) understood now what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been aiming at from the
beginning of the conversation. It was as unreasonable,
impracticable a wish as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had ever urged, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could not help
being moved by so entirely new an idea. The chief point, however,
was to chase away the notion from his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother's mind as quickly as
possible.
<div class="bookquote">``Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, gravely, <div class="bookquote">``thee 't talking wild. Don't let me
hear thee say such things again. It's no good talking o' what can
never be. Dinah's not for marrying; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) heart on a
different sort o' life.''



 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>658

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Lisbeth, impatiently, <div class="bookquote">``very like she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s none for

shouldna ha' been for marr'ing thy feyther if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'d ne’er axed me;
an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s as fond o' thee as e'er I war o' Thias, poor fellow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lisbeth/Lisbeth Bede</b></font>)</div>The blood rushed to Adam's face, and for a few moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
was not quite conscious where he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was. His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother and the kitchen
had vanished for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) saw nothing but Dinah's face turned
up towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). It seemed as if there were a resurrection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
dead joy. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) woke up very speedily from that dream -LRB-the
waking was chill and sad-RRB-, for it would have been very foolish in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to believe his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother's words--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could have no ground for
them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was prompted to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) disbelief very strongly--
perhaps that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) might call forth the proofs, if there were any to be
offered.
<div class="bookquote">``What dost say such things for, Mother, when thee'st got no
foundation for ’em? Thee know'st nothing as gives thee a right to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then I knowna nought as gi’es me a right to say as the year's

But I can see as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) doesna behave tow'rt thee as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) daes tow'rt

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But thee canstna be sure as the trembling means love?''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said
Adam anxiously.
``Eh, what else should it mane? It isna hate, I reckon. An' what
should she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) do but love thee? Thee't made to be loved--for where's



<p/>659

<p/>there a straighter cliverer man? An' what's it sinnify her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bein' a
Methody? It's on'y the marigold i' th' parridge.''
Adam had thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) pockets, and was looking
down at the book on the table, without seeing any of the letters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
was trembling like a gold-seeker who sees the strong promise of
gold but sees in the same moment a sickening vision of
disappointment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could not trust his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother's insight; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had
seen what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wished to see. And yet--and yet, now the
suggestion had been made to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) remembered so many
things, very slight things, like the stirring of the water by an
imperceptible breeze, which seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) some confirmation of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother's words.
Lisbeth noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was moved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``An' thee 't
find out as thee 't poorly aff when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s gone. Thee 't fonder on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
nor thee know'st. Thy eyes follow her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) about, welly as Gyp's follow
thee.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Adam could sit still no longer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) rose, took down his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hat, and
went out into the fields.
The sunshine was on them: that early autumn sunshine which
we should know was not summer's, even if there were not the
touches of yellow on the lime and chestnut; the Sunday sunshine
too, which has more than autumnal calmness for the working
man; the morning sunshine, which still leaves the dew-crystals on
the fine gossamer webs in the shadow of the bushy hedgerows.
Adam needed the calm influence; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was amazed at the way in
which this new thought of Dinah's love had taken possession of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), with an overmastering power that made all other feelings
give way before the impetuous desire to know that the thought
was true. Strange, that till that moment the possibility of their ever



<p/>660

<p/>being lovers had never crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mind, and yet now, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
longing suddenly went out towards that possibility. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had no
more doubt or hesitation as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) own wishes than the bird that
flies towards the opening through which the daylight gleams and
the breath of heaven enters.
The autumnal Sunday sunshine soothed him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), but not by
preparing him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) with resignation to the disappointment if his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
mother--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) himself--proved to be mistaken about Dinah. It
soothed him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) by gentle encouragement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hopes. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) love was
so like that calm sunshine that they seemed to make one presence
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) believed in them both alike. And Dinah was so
bound up with the sad memories of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) first passion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was
not forsaking them, but rather giving them a new sacredness by
loving her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). Nay, his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had grown out of that past: it was
the noon of that morning.
But Seth? Would the lad be hurt? Hardly; for he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had seemed
quite contented of late, and there was no selfish jealousy in him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>);
he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had never been jealous of his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mother's fondness for Adam. But
had he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) seen anything of what their mother talked about? Adam
longed to know this, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could trust Seth's
observation better than his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) must talk to Seth before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) went to see Dinah, and, with this intention in his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)
walked back to the cottage and said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``Did Seth say
anything to thee about when he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) was coming home? Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) be
back to dinner?''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye, lad, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'ll be back for a wonder. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) isna gone to

<p/>661

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, but he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) aften goes to th' Common. Thee know'st more o's
goings nor I do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam wanted to go and meet Seth, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) must content himself
with walking about the near fields and getting sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) as soon
as possible. That would not be for more than an hour to come, for
Seth would scarcely be at home much before their dinner-time,
which was twelve o’clock. But Adam could not sit down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
reading again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) sauntered along by the brook and stood
leaning against the stiles, with eager intense eyes, which looked as
if they saw something very vividly; but it was not the brook or the
willows, not the fields or the sky. Again and again his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) vision was
interrupted by wonder at the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) own feeling, at the
strength and sweetness of this new love--almost like the wonder a
man feels at the added power he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finds in himself for an art which
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had laid aside for a space. How is it that the poets have said so
many fine things about our first love, so few about our later love?
Are their first poems their best? Or are not those the best which
come from their fuller thought, their larger experience, their
deeper-rooted affections? The boy's flutelike voice has its own
spring charm; but the man should yield a richer deeper music.
At last, there was Seth, visible at the farthest stile, and Adam
hastened to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). Seth was surprised, and thought something
unusual must have happened, but when Adam came up, his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) face
said plainly enough that it was nothing alarming.
<div class="bookquote">``Where hast been?''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, when they were side by side.
<div class="bookquote">``I've been to the Common,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Seth. ``Dinah's been speaking
the Word to a little company of hearers at Brimstone's, as they call
him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>). They're folks as never go to church hardly--them on the
Common--but they'll go and hear Dinah a bit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s been



<p/>662

<p/>speaking with power this forenoon from the words, `I came not to
call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.' And there was a
little thing happened as was pretty to see. The women mostly
bring their children with ’em, but to-day there was one stout curly
headed fellow about three or four year old, that I never saw there
before. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was as naughty as could be at the beginning while I was
praying, and while we was singing, but when we all sat down and
Dinah began to speak, th' young un stood stock still all at once,
and began to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) with's mouth open, and presently he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ran
away from's mother and went to Dinah, and pulled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), like a
little dog, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) to take notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). So Dinah lifted him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) up and
held th' lad on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) lap, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) went on speaking; and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was as
good as could be till he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) went to sleep--and the mother cried to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).''
``It's a pity she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shouldna be a mother herself,'' said Adam, ``so
fond as the children are of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Dost think she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s quite fixed against
marrying, Seth? Dost think nothing 'ud turn her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''
There was something peculiar in his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) brother's tone, which
made Seth steal a glance at his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) face before he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) answered.
``It 'ud be wrong of me to say nothing 'ud turn her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)
answered. ``But if thee mean'st it about myself, I've given up all
thoughts as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can ever be my wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) calls me her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brother, and
that's enough.''
``But dost think she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might ever get fond enough of anybody else
to be willing to marry ’em?'' said Adam rather shyly.
``Well,'' said Seth, after some hesitation, ``it's crossed my mind
sometimes o' late as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might; but Dinah 'ud let no fondness for
the creature draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) out o' the path as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) believed God had
marked out for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) thought the leading was not from Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>),



<p/>663

<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s not one to be brought under the power of it. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s allays
seemed clear about that--as her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) work was to minister t' others,
and make no home for herself i' this world.''
``But suppose,'' said Adam, earnestly, ``suppose there was a
man as 'ud let her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) do just the same and not interfere with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
might do a good deal o' what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) does now, just as well when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
was married as when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was single. Other women of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) sort
have married--that's to say, not just like her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), but women as
preached and attended on the sick and needy. There's Mrs.
Fletcher as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fletcher</b></font>) talks of.''
A new light had broken in on Seth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) turned round, and laying
his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) hand on Adam's shoulder, said, ``Why, wouldst like her (<font color='blue'><b>Fletcher</b></font>) to
marry thee, Brother?''
Adam looked doubtfully at Seth's inquiring eyes and said,
``Wouldst be hurt if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fletcher</b></font>) was to be fonder o' me than o' thee?''
``Nay,'' said Seth warmly, ``how canst think it? Have I felt thy
trouble so little that I shouldna feel thy joy?''
There was silence a few moments as they walked on, and then
Seth said, ``I'd no notion as thee'dst ever think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fletcher</b></font>) for a wife.''
``But is it o' any use to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fletcher</b></font>)?'' said Adam. ``What dost
say? Mother's made me as I hardly know where I am, with what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s been saying to me this forenoon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s sure Dinah
feels for me more than common, and 'ud be willing t' have me. But
I'm afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) speaks without book. I want to know if thee'st seen
anything.''
``It's a nice point to speak about,'' said Seth, <div class="bookquote">``and I'm afraid o'
being wrong; besides, we've no right t' intermeddle with people's
feelings when they wouldn't tell ’em themselves.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Seth paused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But thee mightst ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) said presently. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) took no

about making folks enter the Society, so as they're fit t' enter the

displeased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) for that.''

<p/>Chapter LII
Adam and Dinah

<p/>I

<p/>t was about three o’clock when Adam entered the farmyard
and roused Alick and the dogs from their Sunday dozing.
Alick said everybody was gone to church <div class="bookquote">``but th' young
missis'' (<font color='red'><b>everybody</b></font>)</div>--so he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) called Dinah--but this did not disappoint Adam,
although the <div class="bookquote">``everybody''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>was so liberal as to include Nancy the
dairymaid, whose works of necessity were not unfrequently
incompatible with church-going.
There was perfect stillness about the house. The doors were all
closed, and the very stones and tubs seemed quieter than usual.
Adam heard the water gently dripping from the pump--that was
the only sound--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) knocked at the house door rather softly, as
was suitable in that stillness.
The door opened, and Dinah stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), colouring deeply
with the great surprise of seeing Adam at this hour, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
knew it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) regular practice to be at church. Yesterday he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
would have said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) without any difficulty, <div class="bookquote">``I came to see you,
Dinah: I knew the rest were not at home.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But to-day something
prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) from saying that, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) in
silence. Neither of them spoke, and yet both wished they could
speak, as Adam entered, and they sat down. Dinah took the chair
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had just left; it was at the corner of the table near the window,
and there was a book lying on the table, but it was not open. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
had been sitting perfectly still, looking at the small bit of clear fire
in the bright grate. Adam sat down opposite her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), in Mr. Poyser's




<p/>666

<p/>three-cornered chair.
<div class="bookquote">``Your mother is not ill again, I hope, Adam?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>Dinah said,
recovering herself. <div class="bookquote">``Seth said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was well this morning.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s very hearty to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, happy in the signs of
Dinah's feeling at the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), but shy.
<div class="bookquote">``There's nobody at home, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>Dinah said; <div class="bookquote">``but you'll wait.
You've been hindered from going to church to-day, doubtless.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam said, and then paused, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I was
thinking about you: that was the reason.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This confession was very awkward and sudden, Adam felt, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought Dinah must understand all he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) meant. But the
frankness of the words caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) immediately to interpret them
into a renewal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) brotherly regrets that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was going away,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) answered calmly, <div class="bookquote">``Do not be careful and troubled for me,
Adam. I have all things and abound at Snowfield. And my mind is
at rest, for I am not seeking my own will in going.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But if things were different, Dinah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, hesitatingly.
<div class="bookquote">``If you knew things that perhaps you don't know now ... ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>Dinah looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) inquiringly, but instead of going on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
reached a chair and brought it near the corner of the table where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was sitting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) wondered, and was afraid--and the next
moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) thoughts flew to the past: was it something about
those distant unhappy ones that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) didn't know?
Adam looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). It was so sweet to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) eyes, which
had now a self-forgetful questioning in them--for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
forgot that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) wanted to say anything, or that it was necessary to
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) meant.
<div class="bookquote">``Dinah,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said suddenly, taking both her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hands between his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>),
``I love you with my whole heart and soul. I love you next to God



<p/>667

<p/>who made me.''
Dinah's lips became pale, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) cheeks, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) trembled
violently under the shock of painful joy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hands were cold as
death between Adam's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) could not draw them away, because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) held them fast.
``Don't tell me you can't love me, Dinah. Don't tell me we must
part and pass our lives away from one another.''
The tears were trembling in Dinah's eyes, and they fell before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) could answer. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) spoke in a quiet low voice.
``Yes, dear Adam, we must submit to another Will. We must
part.''
``Not if you love me, Dinah--not if you love me,'' Adam said
passionately. ``Tell me--tell me if you can love me better than a
brother?''
Dinah was too entirely reliant on the Supreme guidance to
attempt to achieve any end by a deceptive concealment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was
recovering now from the first shock of emotion, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) looked at
Adam with simple sincere eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) said, ``Yes, Adam, my heart
is drawn strongly towards you; and of my own will, if I had no
clear showing to the contrary, I could find my happiness in being
near you and ministering to you continually. I fear I should forget
to rejoice and weep with others; nay, I fear I should forget the
Divine presence, and seek no love but yours.''
Adam did not speak immediately. They sat looking at each
other in delicious silence--for the first sense of mutual love
excludes other feelings; it will have the soul all to itself.
``Then, Dinah,'' Adam said at last, ``how can there be anything
contrary to what's right in our belonging to one another and
spending our lives together? Who put this great love into our



<p/>668

<p/>hearts? Can anything be holier than that? For we can help one
another in everything as is good. I'd never think o' putting myself
between you and God, and saying you oughtn't to do this and you
oughtn't to do that. You'd follow your conscience as much as you
do now.''
``Yes, Adam,'' Dinah said, ``I know marriage is a holy state for
those who are truly called to it, and have no other drawing; but
from my childhood upwards I have been led towards another path;
all my peace and my joy have come from having no life of my own,
no wants, no wishes for myself, and living only in God and those of
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) creatures whose sorrows and joys he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has given me to know.
Those have been very blessed years to me, and I feel that if I was
to listen to any voice that would draw me aside from that path, I
should be turning my back on the light that has shone upon me,
and darkness and doubt would take hold of me. We could not bless
each other, Adam, if there were doubts in my soul, and if I
yearned, when it was too late, after that better part which had
once been given me and I had put away from me.''
``But if a new feeling has come into your mind, Dinah, and if
you love me so as to be willing to be nearer to me than to other
people, isn't that a sign that it's right for you to change your life?
Doesn't the love make it right when nothing else would?''
``Adam, my mind is full of questionings about that; for now,
since you tell me of your strong love towards me, what was clear to
me has become dark again. I felt before that my heart was too
strongly drawn towards you, and that your heart was not as mine;
and the thought of you had taken hold of me, so that my soul had
lost its freedom, and was becoming enslaved to an earthly
affection, which made me anxious and careful about what should



<p/>669

<p/>befall myself. For in all other affection I had been content with any
small return, or with none; but my heart was beginning to hunger
after an equal love from you. And I had no doubt that I must
wrestle against that as a great temptation, and the command was
clear that I must go away.''
``But now, dear, dear Dinah, now you know I love you better
than you love me ... it's all different now. You won't think o'
going. You'll stay, and be my dear wife, and I shall thank God for
giving me my life as I never thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) before.''
``Adam, it's hard to me to turn a deaf ear ... you know it's hard;
but a great fear is upon me. It seems to me as if you were
stretching out your arms to me, and beckoning me to come and
take my ease and live for my own delight, and Jesus, the Man of
Sorrows, was standing looking towards me, and pointing to the
sinful, and suffering, and afflicted. I have seen that again and
again when I have been sitting in stillness and darkness, and a
great terror has come upon me lest I should become hard, and a
lover of self, and no more bear willingly the Redeemer's cross.''
Dinah had closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) eyes, and a faint shudder went through
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). ``Adam,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) went on, ``you wouldn't desire that we should
seek a good through any unfaithfulness to the light that is in us;
you wouldn't believe that could be a good. We are of one mind in
that.''
``Yes, Dinah,'' said Adam sadly, ``I'll never be the man t' urge
you against your conscience. But I can't give up the hope that you
may come to see different. I don't believe your loving me could
shut up your heart--it's only adding to what you've been before,
not taking away from it. For it seems to me it's the same with love
and happiness as with sorrow--the more we know of it the better



<p/>670

<p/>we can feel what other people's lives are or might be, and so we
shall only be more tender to ’em, and wishful to help ’em. The
more knowledge a man has, the better he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll do's work; and
feeling's a sort o' knowledge.''
Dinah was silent; her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) eyes were fixed in contemplation of
something visible only to herself. Adam went on presently with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
pleading, ``And you can do almost as much as you do now. I won't
ask you to go to church with me of a Sunday. You shall go where
you like among the people, and teach ’em; for though I like church
best, I don't put my soul above yours, as if my words was better for
you to follow than your own conscience. And you can help the sick
just as much, and you'll have more means o' making ’em a bit
comfortable; and you'll be among all your own friends as love you,
and can help ’em and be a blessing to ’em till their dying day.
Surely, Dinah, you'd be as near to God as if you was living lonely
and away from me.''
Dinah made no answer for some time. Adam was still holding
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hands and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) with almost trembling anxiety, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) grave loving eyes on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) and said, in rather a sad
voice, ``Adam there is truth in what you say, and there's many of
the brethren and sisters who have greater strength than I have,
and find their hearts enlarged by the cares of husband and
kindred. But I have not faith that it would be so with me, for since
my affections have been set above measure on you, I have had less
peace and joy in God. I have felt as it were a division in my heart.
And think how it is with me, Adam. That life I have led is like a
land I have trodden in blessedness since my childhood; and if I
long for a moment to follow the voice which calls me to another
land that I know not, I cannot but fear that my soul might



<p/>671

<p/>hereafter yearn for that early blessedness which I had forsaken;
and where doubt enters there is not perfect love. I must wait for
clearer guidance. I must go from you, and we must submit
ourselves entirely to the Divine Will. We are sometimes required
to lay our natural lawful affections on the altar.''
Adam dared not plead again, for Dinah's was not the voice of
caprice or insincerity. But it was very hard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) eyes got
dim as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>).
``But you may come to feel satisfied ... to feel that you may
come to me again, and we may never part, Dinah?''
``We must submit ourselves, Adam. With time, our duty will be
made clear. It may be when I have entered on my former life, I
shall find all these new thoughts and wishes vanish, and become
as things that were not. Then I shall know that my calling is not
towards marriage. But we must wait.''
``Dinah,'' said Adam mournfully, ``you can't love me so well as I
love you, else you'd have no doubts. But it's natural you shouldn't,
for I'm not so good as you. I can't doubt it's right for me to love the
best thing God's ever given me to know.''
``Nay, Adam. It seems to me that my love for you is not weak,
for my heart waits on your words and looks, almost as a little child
waits on the help and tenderness of the strong on whom it
depends. If the thought of you took slight hold of me, I should not
fear that it would be an idol in the temple. But you will strengthen
me--you will not hinder me in seeking to obey to the uttermost.''
``Let us go out into the sunshine, Dinah, and walk together. I'll
speak no word to disturb you.''
They went out and walked towards the fields, where they would
meet the family coming from church. Adam said, ``Take my arm,



<p/>672

<p/>Dinah,'' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) took it. That was the only change in their manner
to each other since they were last walking together. But no
sadness in the prospect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) going away--in the uncertainty of
the issue--could rob the sweetness from Adam's sense that Dinah
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would stay at the Hall Farm all that
evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would be near her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could.
``Hey-day! There's Adam along wi' Dinah,'' said Mr. Poyser, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) opened the far gate into the Home Close. ``I couldna think how
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) happened away from church. Why,'' added good Martin, after a
moment's pause, ``what dost think has just jumped into my head?''
``Summat as hadna far to jump, for it's just under our nose. You
mean as Adam's fond o' Dinah.''
``Aye! hast ever had any notion of it before?''
``To be sure I have,'' said Mrs. Poyser, who always declined, if
possible, to be taken by surprise. ``I'm not one o' those as can see
the cat i' the dairy an' wonder what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s come after.''
``Thee never saidst a word to me about it.''
``Well, I aren't like a bird-clapper, forced to make a rattle when
the wind blows on me. I can keep my own counsel when there's no
good i' speaking.''
``But Dinah 'll ha' none o' him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>). Dost think she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) will?''
``Nay,'' said Mrs. Poyser, not sufficiently on her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) guard against a
possible surprise, ``she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'ll never marry anybody, if he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) isn't a
Methodist and a cripple.''
``It 'ud ha' been a pretty thing though for ’em t' marry,'' said
Martin, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) head on one side, as if in pleased
contemplation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) new idea. ``Thee'dst ha' liked it too,
wouldstna?''
``Ah! I should. I should ha' been sure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) then, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)



<p/>673

<p/>wouldn't go away from me to Snowfield, welly thirty mile off, and
me not got a creatur to look to, only neighbours, as are no kin to
me, an' most of ’em women as I'd be ashamed to show my face, if
my dairy things war like their’n. There may well be streaky butter
i' the market. An' I should be glad to see the poor thing settled like
a Christian woman, with a house of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head; and
we'd stock her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) well wi' linen and feathers, for I love her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) next to my
own children. An' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) makes one feel safer when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s i' the house,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s like the driven snow: anybody might sin for two as had
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at their elbow.''
``Dinah,'' said Tommy, running forward to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>), ``mother
says you'll never marry anybody but a Methodist cripple. What a
silly you must be!'' a comment which Tommy followed up by
seizing Dinah with both arms, and dancing along by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) side with
incommodious fondness.
``Why, Adam, we missed you i' the singing to-day,'' said Mr.
Poyser. ``How was it?''
``I wanted to see Dinah--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s going away so soon,'' said Adam.
``Ah, lad! Can you persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) to stop somehow? Find her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) a
good husband somewhere i' the parish. If you'll do that, we'll
forgive you for missing church. But, anyway, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) isna going before
the harvest supper o' Wednesday, and you must come then.
There's Bartle Massey comin', an' happen Craig. You'll be sure an'
come, now, at seven? The missis wunna have it a bit later.''
``Aye,'' said Adam, ``I'll come if I can. But I can't often say what
I'll do beforehand, for the work often holds me longer than I
expect. You'll stay till the end o' the week, Dinah?''
``Yes, yes!'' said Mr. Poyser. ``We'll have no nay.''
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s no call to be in a hurry,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>observed Mrs. Poyser.



<p/>674

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Scarceness o' victual 'ull keep: there's no need to be hasty wi' the
cooking. An' scarceness is what there's the biggest stock of i' that
country.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>Dinah smiled, but gave no promise to stay, and they talked of
other things through the rest of the walk, lingering in the sunshine
to look at the great flock of geese grazing, at the new corn-ricks,
and at the surprising abundance of fruit on the old pear-tree;
Nancy and Molly having already hastened home, side by side, each
holding, carefully wrapped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief, a prayerbook, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) could read little beyond the large letters and
the Amens.
Surely all other leisure is hurry compared with a sunny walk
through the fields from <div class="bookquote">``afternoon church'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--as such walks used
to be in those old leisurely times, when the boat, gliding sleepily
along the canal, was the newest locomotive wonder; when Sunday
books had most of them old brown-leather covers, and opened
with remarkable precision always in one place. Leisure is gone--
gone where the spinning-wheels are gone, and the pack-horses,
and the slow waggons, and the pedlars, who brought bargains to
the door on sunny afternoons. Ingenious philosophers tell you,
perhaps, that the great work of the steam-engine is to create
leisure for mankind. Do not believe them: it only creates a vacuum
for eager thought to rush in. Even idleness is eager now--eager for
amusement; prone to excursion-trains, art museums, periodical
literature, and exciting novels; prone even to scientific theorising
and cursory peeps through microscopes. Old Leisure was quite a
different personage. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) only read one newspaper, innocent of
leaders, and was free from that periodicity of sensations which we
call post-time. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was a contemplative, rather stout gentleman, of



<p/>675

<p/>excellent digestion; of quiet perceptions, undiseased by
hypothesis; happy in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) inability to know the causes of things,
preferring the things themselves. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) lived chiefly in the country,
among pleasant seats and homesteads, and was fond of sauntering
by the fruit-tree wall and scenting the apricots when they were
warmed by the morning sunshine, or of sheltering himself under
the orchard boughs at noon, when the summer pears were falling.
He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knew nothing of weekday services, and thought none the worse
of the Sunday sermon if it allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to sleep from the text to the
blessing; liking the afternoon service best, because the prayers
were the shortest, and not ashamed to say so; for he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had an easy,
jolly conscience, broad-backed like himself, and able to carry a
great deal of beer or port-wine, not being made squeamish by
doubts and qualms and lofty aspirations. Life was not a task to
him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), but a sinecure. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) fingered the guineas in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) pocket, and ate
his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) dinners, and slept the sleep of the irresponsible, for had he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) not
kept up his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) character by going to church on the Sunday
afternoons?
Fine old Leisure! Do not be severe upon him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), and judge him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) by
our modern standard. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) never went to Exeter Hall, or heard a
popular preacher, or read Tracts for the Times or Sartor Resartus.




<p/>676

<p/>Chapter LIII
The Harvest Supper

<p/>A

<p/>s Adam was going homeward, on Wednesday evening, in
the six o’clock sunlight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) saw in the distance the last
load of barley winding its way towards the yard-gate of the
Hall Farm, and heard the chant of <div class="bookquote">``Harvest Home!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>rising and
sinking like a wave. Fainter and fainter, and more musical through
the growing distance, the falling dying sound still reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) neared the Willow Brook. The low westering sun shone right on
the shoulders of the old Binton Hills, turning the unconscious
sheep into bright spots of light; shone on the windows of the
cottage too, and made them a-flame with a glory beyond that of
amber or amethyst. It was enough to make Adam feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was
in a great temple, and that the distant chant was a sacred song.
<div class="bookquote">``It's wonderful,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``how that sound goes to one's
heart almost like a funeral bell, for all it tells one o' the joyfullest
time o' the year, and the time when men are mostly the
thankfullest. I suppose it's a bit hard to us to think anything's over
and gone in our lives; and there's a parting at the root of all our
joys. It's like what I feel about Dinah. I should never ha' come to
know that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) love 'ud be the greatest o' blessings to me, if what I
counted a blessing hadn't been wrenched and torn away from me,
and left me with a greater need, so as I could crave and hunger for
a greater and a better comfort.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) expected to see Dinah again this evening, and get leave to
accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) as far as Oakbourne; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) to




<p/>677

<p/>fix some time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) might go to Snowfield, and learn whether
the last best hope that had been born to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) must be resigned like
the rest. The work he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had to do at home, besides putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
best clothes, made it seven before he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) way again to the
Hall Farm, and it was questionable whether, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>) longest and
quickest strides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>) should be there in time even for the roast beef,
which came after the plum pudding, for Mrs. Poyser's supper
would be punctual.
Great was the clatter of knives and pewter plates and tin cans
when Adam entered the house, but there was no hum of voices to
this accompaniment: the eating of excellent roast beef, provided
free of expense, was too serious a business to those good farmlabourers to be performed with a divided attention, even if they
had had anything to say to each other--which they had not. And
Mr. Poyser, at the head of the table, was too busy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) carving
to listen to Bartle Massey's or Mr. Craig's ready talk.
<div class="bookquote">``Here, Adam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Poyser, who was standing and looking
on to see that Molly and Nancy did their duty as waiters, <div class="bookquote">``here's a
place kept for you between Mr. Massey and the boys. It's a poor
tale you couldn't come to see the pudding when it was whole.''
 (<font color='red'><b>waiters</b></font>)</div>Adam looked anxiously round for a fourth woman's figure, but
Dinah was not there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was almost afraid of asking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>);
besides, his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) attention was claimed by greetings, and there
remained the hope that Dinah was in the house, though perhaps
disinclined to festivities on the eve of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) departure.
It was a goodly sight--that table, with Martin Poyser's round
good-humoured face and large person at the head of it helping his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
servants to the fragrant roast beef and pleased when the empty
plates came again. Martin, though usually blest with a good



<p/>678

<p/>appetite, really forgot to finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) own beef to-night--it was so
pleasant to him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) to look on in the intervals of carving and see how
the others enjoyed their supper; for were they not men who, on all
the days of the year except Christmas Day and Sundays, ate their
cold dinner, in a makeshift manner, under the hedgerows, and
drank their beer out of wooden bottles--with relish certainly, but
with their mouths towards the zenith, after a fashion more
endurable to ducks than to human bipeds. Martin Poyser had
some faint conception of the flavour such men must find in hot
roast beef and fresh-drawn ale. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) head on one side and
screwed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) mouth, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) nudged Bartle Massey, and watched
half-witted Tom Tholer, otherwise known as <div class="bookquote">``Tom Saft,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom</b></font>)</div>receiving
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) second plateful of beef. A grin of delight broke over Tom's face
as the plate was set down before him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), between his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knife and fork,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) held erect, as if they had been sacred tapers. But the
delight was too strong to continue smouldering in a grin--it burst
out the next instant in a long-drawn <div class="bookquote">``haw, haw!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>followed by a
sudden collapse into utter gravity, as the knife and fork darted
down on the prey. Martin Poyser's large person shook with his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
silent unctuous laugh. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) turned towards Mrs. Poyser to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
too had been observant of Tom, and the eyes of husband and wife
met in a glance of good-natured amusement.
<div class="bookquote">``Tom Saft''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was a great favourite on the farm, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) played
the part of the old jester, and made up for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) practical deficiencies
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) success in repartee. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hits, I imagine, were those of the
flail, which falls quite at random, but nevertheless smashes an
insect now and then. They were much quoted at sheep-shearing
and haymaking times, but I refrain from recording them here, lest
Tom's wit should prove to be like that of many other bygone



<p/>679

<p/>jesters eminent in their day--rather of a temporary nature, not
dealing with the deeper and more lasting relations of things.
Tom excepted, Martin Poyser had some pride in his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) servants
and labourers, thinking with satisfaction that they were the best
worth their pay of any set on the estate. There was Kester Bale, for
example -LRB-Beale, probably, if the truth were known, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bale</b></font>) was
called Bale, and was not conscious of any claim to a fifth letter-RRB-,
the old man with the close leather cap and the network of wrinkles
on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sun-browned face. Was there any man in Loamshire who
knew better the <div class="bookquote">``natur''  (<font color='red'><b>any man</b></font>)</div>of all farming work? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was one of those
invaluable labourers who can not only turn their hand to
everything, but excel in everything they turn their hand to. It is
true Kester's knees were much bent outward by this time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kester</b></font>)
walked with a perpetual curtsy, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Kester</b></font>) were among the, most
reverent of men. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Kester</b></font>) was; but I am obliged to admit that the
object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kester</b></font>) reverence was his (<font color='blue'><b>Kester</b></font>) own skill, towards which he (<font color='blue'><b>Kester</b></font>)
performed some rather affecting acts of worship. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kester</b></font>) always
thatched the ricks--for if anything were his (<font color='blue'><b>Kester</b></font>) forte more than
another, it was thatching--and when the last touch had been put
to the last beehive rick, Kester, whose home lay at some distance
from the farm, would take a walk to the rick-yard in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kester</b></font>) best
clothes on a Sunday morning and stand in the lane, at a due
distance, to contemplate his (<font color='blue'><b>Kester</b></font>) own thatching walking about to get
each rick from the proper point of view. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Kester</b></font>) curtsied along, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Kester</b></font>) eyes upturned to the straw knobs imitative of golden globes at
the summits of the beehive ricks, which indeed were gold of the
best sort, you might have imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>Kester</b></font>) to be engaged in some
pagan act of adoration. Kester was an old bachelor and reputed to
have stockings full of coin, concerning which his (<font color='blue'><b>Kester</b></font>) master cracked a



<p/>680

<p/>joke with him (<font color='blue'><b>Kester</b></font>) every pay-night: not a new unseasoned joke, but a
good old one, that had been tried many times before and had worn
well. <div class="bookquote">``Th' young measter's a merry mon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kester</b></font>)</div>Kester frequently
remarked; for having begun his (<font color='blue'><b>Kester</b></font>) career by frightening away the
crows under the last Martin Poyser but one, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) could never cease
to account the reigning Martin a young master. I am not ashamed
of commemorating old Kester. You and I are indebted to the hard
hands of such men--hands that have long ago mingled with the
soil they tilled so faithfully, thriftily making the best they could of
the earth's fruits, and receiving the smallest share as their own
wages.
Then, at the end of the table, opposite his (<font color='blue'><b>Kester</b></font>) master, there was
Alick, the shepherd and head-man, with the ruddy face and broad
shoulders, not on the best terms with old Kester; indeed, their
intercourse was confined to an occasional snarl, for though they
probably differed little concerning hedging and ditching and the
treatment of ewes, there was a profound difference of opinion
between them as to their own respective merits. When Tityrus and
Meliboeus happen to be on the same farm, they are not
sentimentally polite to each other. Alick, indeed, was not by any
means a honeyed man. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speech had usually something of a
snarl in it, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) broad-shouldered aspect something of the bulldog expression--<div class="bookquote">``Don't you meddle with me, and I won't meddle
with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was honest even to the splitting of an oat-grain
rather than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would take beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) acknowledged share, and as
<div class="bookquote">``close-fisted''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master's property as if it had been his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
own--throwing very small handfuls of damaged barley to the
chickens, because a large handful affected his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) imagination
painfully with a sense of profusion. Good-tempered Tim, the



<p/>681

<p/>waggoner, who loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) horses, had his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) grudge against Alick in
the matter of corn. They rarely spoke to each other, and never
looked at each other, even over their dish of cold potatoes; but
then, as this was their usual mode of behaviour towards all
mankind, it would be an unsafe conclusion that they had more
than transient fits of unfriendliness. The bucolic character at
Hayslope, you perceive, was not of that entirely genial, merry,
broad-grinning sort, apparently observed in most districts visited
by artists. The mild radiance of a smile was a rare sight on a fieldlabourer's face, and there was seldom any gradation between
bovine gravity and a laugh. Nor was every labourer so honest as
our friend Alick. At this very table, among Mr. Poyser's men, there
is that big Ben Tholoway, a very powerful thresher, but detected
more than once in carrying away his (<font color='blue'><b>Tholoway</b></font>) master's corn in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tholoway</b></font>)
pockets--an action which, as Ben was not a philosopher, could
hardly be ascribed to absence of mind. However, his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) master had
forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>), and continued to employ him (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>), for the Tholoways had
lived on the Common time out of mind, and had always worked for
the Poysers. And on the whole, I daresay, society was not much
the worse because Ben had not six months of it at the treadmill,
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) views of depredation were narrow, and the House of
Correction might have enlarged them. As it was, Ben ate his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) roast
beef to-night with a serene sense of having stolen nothing more
than a few peas and beans as seed for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) garden since the last
harvest supper, and felt warranted in thinking that Alick's
suspicious eye, for ever upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>), was an injury to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) innocence.
But now the roast beef was finished and the cloth was drawn,
leaving a fair large deal table for the bright drinking-cans, and the
foaming brown jugs, and the bright brass candlesticks, pleasant to



<p/>682

<p/>behold. now, the great ceremony of the evening was to begin--the
harvest-song, in which every man must join. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might be in tune,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked to be singular, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must not sit with closed lips. The
movement was obliged to be in triple time; the rest was ad libitum.
As to the origin of this song--whether it came in its actual state
from the brain of a single rhapsodist, or was gradually perfected
by a school or succession of rhapsodists, I am ignorant. There is a
stamp of unity, of individual genius upon it, which inclines me to
the former hypothesis, though I am not blind to the consideration
that this unity may rather have arisen from that consensus of
many minds which was a condition of primitive thought, foreign to
our modern consciousness. Some will perhaps think that they
detect in the first quatrain an indication of a lost line, which later
rhapsodists, failing in imaginative vigour, have supplied by the
feeble device of iteration. Others, however, may rather maintain
that this very iteration is an original felicity, to which none but the
most prosaic minds can be insensible.
The ceremony connected with the song was a drinking
ceremony. -LRB-That is perhaps a painful fact, but then, you know, we
cannot reform our forefathers.-RRB- During the first and second
quatrain, sung decidedly forte, no can was filled.
``Here's a health unto our master,
The founder of the feast;
Here's a health unto our master
And to our mistress!
And may his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) doings prosper,
Whate’er he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) takes in hand,



<p/>683

<p/>For we are all his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) servants,
And are at his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) command.
But now, immediately before the third quatrain or chorus, sung
fortissimo, with emphatic raps of the table, which gave the effect of
cymbals and drum together, Alick's can was filled, and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was
bound to empty it before the chorus ceased.
``Then drink, boys, drink!
And see ye do not spill,
For if ye do, ye shall drink two,
For 'tis our master's will.
When Alick had gone successfully through this test of steadyhanded manliness, it was the turn of old Kester, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Kester</b></font>) right
hand--and so on, till every man had drunk his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) initiatory pint
under the stimulus of the chorus. Tom Saft--the rogue--took care
to spill a little by accident; but Mrs. Poyser -LRB-too officiously, Tom
thought-RRB- interfered to prevent the exaction of the penalty.
To any listener outside the door it would have been the reverse
of obvious why the <div class="bookquote">``Drink, boys, drink!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>should have such an
immediate and often-repeated encore; but once entered, he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) would
have seen that all faces were at present sober, and most of them
serious--it was the regular and respectable thing for those
excellent farm-labourers to do, as much as for elegant ladies and
gentlemen to smirk and bow over their wine-glasses. Bartle
Massey, whose ears were rather sensitive, had gone out to see
what sort of evening it was at an early stage in the ceremony, and
had not finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) contemplation until a silence of five minutes



<p/>684

<p/>declared that <div class="bookquote">``Drink, boys, drink!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was not likely to begin again
for the next twelvemonth. Much to the regret of the boys and
Totty: on them the stillness fell rather flat, after that glorious
thumping of the table, towards which Totty, seated on her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) father's
knee, contributed with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) small might and small fist.
When Bartle re-entered, however, there appeared to be a
general desire for solo music after the choral. Nancy declared that
Tim the waggoner knew a song and was <div class="bookquote">``allays singing like a lark
i' the stable,''  (<font color='red'><b>the waggoner</b></font>)</div>whereupon Mr. Poyser said encouragingly, <div class="bookquote">``Come,
Tim, lad, let's hear it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>Tim looked sheepish, tucked down his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
head, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) couldn't sing, but this encouraging invitation of
the master's was echoed all round the table. It was a
conversational opportunity: everybody could say, <div class="bookquote">``Come, Tim,''
 (<font color='red'><b>everybody</b></font>)</div>except Alick, who never relaxed into the frivolity of unnecessary
speech. At last, Tim's next neighbour, Ben Tholoway, began to
give emphasis to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tholoway</b></font>) speech by nudges, at which Tim, growing
rather savage, said, <div class="bookquote">``Let me alooan, will ye? Else I'll ma' ye sing a
toon ye wonna like.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>A good-tempered waggoner's patience has
limits, and Tim was not to be urged further.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, then, David, ye're the lad to sing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben/Ben Tholoway</b></font>)</div>said Ben, willing to
show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) was not discomfited by this check. ``Sing `M' loove's a
roos wi’out a thorn.'''
The amatory David was a young man of an unconscious
abstracted expression, which was due probably to a squint of
superior intensity rather than to any mental characteristic; for he (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>)
was not indifferent to Ben's invitation, but blushed and laughed
and rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) sleeve over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) mouth in a way that was regarded
as a symptom of yielding. And for some time the company
appeared to be much in earnest about the desire to hear David's



<p/>685

<p/>song. But in vain. The lyricism of the evening was in the cellar at
present, and was not to be drawn from that retreat just yet.
Meanwhile the conversation at the head of the table had taken
a political turn. Mr. Craig was not above talking politics
occasionally, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) piqued himself rather on a wise insight
than on specific information. He (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) saw so far beyond the mere facts
of a case that really it was superfluous to know them.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm no reader o' the paper myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) observed to-night, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)
filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) pipe, ``though I might read it fast enough if I liked, for
there's Miss Lyddy has ’em and 's done with ’em i' no time. But
there's Mills, now, sits i' the chimney-corner and reads the paper
pretty nigh from morning to night, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mills</b></font>)'s got to th' end on
't he (<font color='blue'><b>Mills</b></font>)'s more addle-headed than he (<font color='blue'><b>Mills</b></font>) was at the beginning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mills</b></font>)'s full
o' this peace now, as they talk on; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mills</b></font>)'s been reading and reading,
and thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Mills</b></font>)'s got to the bottom on't. `Why, Lor' bless you, Mills,'
says I, `you see no more into this thing nor you can see into the
middle of a potato. I'll tell you what it is: you think it'll be a fine
thing for the country. And I'm not again' it--mark my words--I'm
not again' it. But it's my opinion as there's them at the head o' this
country as are worse enemies to us nor Bony and all the
mounseers he (<font color='blue'><b>Mills</b></font>)'s got at 's back; for as for the mounseers, you may
skewer half-a-dozen of ’em at once as if they war frogs.'''
``Aye, aye,'' said Martin Poyser, listening with an air of much
intelligence and edification, ``they ne’er ate a bit o' beef i' their
lives. Mostly sallet, I reckon.''
<div class="bookquote">``And says I to Mills,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Craig, ```Will you try to
make me believe as furriners like them can do us half th' harm
them ministers do with their bad government? If King George 'ud
turn ’em all away and govern by himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'d see everything



<p/>686

<p/>righted. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) might take on Billy Pitt again if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) liked; but I don't
see myself what we want wi' anybody besides King and
Parliament. It's that nest o' ministers does the mischief, I tell
you.'''
<div class="bookquote">``Ah, it's fine talking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Poyser/Poyser</b></font>)</div>observed Mrs. Poyser, who was now
seated near her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) husband, with Totty on her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) lap--<div class="bookquote">``it's fine talking.
It's hard work to tell which is Old Harry when everybody's got
boots on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Totty</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``As for this peace,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) head on one
side in a dubitative manner and giving a precautionary puff to his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)
pipe between each sentence, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know. Th' war's a fine thing
for the country, an' how'll you keep up prices wi’out it? An' them
French are a wicked sort o' folks, by what I can make out. What
can you do better nor fight ’em?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ye're partly right there, Poyser,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Craig/Craig</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Craig, ``but I'm not
again' the peace--to make a holiday for a bit. We can break it
when we like, an' I'm in no fear o' Bony, for all they talk so much o'
his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) cliverness. That's what I says to Mills this morning. Lor' bless
you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mills</b></font>) sees no more through Bony! ... why, I put him (<font color='blue'><b>Mills</b></font>) up to more
in three minutes than he (<font color='blue'><b>Mills</b></font>) gets from 's paper all the year round.
Says I, `Am I a gardener as knows his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) business, or arn't I, Mills?
Answer me that.' `To be sure y' are, Craig,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>)'s not a bad
fellow, Mills isn't, for a butler, but weak i' the head. `Well,' says I,
`you talk o' Bony's cliverness; would it be any use my being a firstrate gardener if I'd got nought but a quagmire to work on?' `No,'
says he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>). `Well,' I says, 'that's just what it is wi' Bony. I'll not deny
but he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) may be a bit cliver--he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>)'s no Frenchman born, as I
understand--but what's he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) got at's back but mounseers?'''
Mr. Craig paused a moment with an emphatic stare after this



<p/>687

<p/>triumphant specimen of Socratic argument, and then added,
thumping the table rather fiercely, <div class="bookquote">``Why, it's a sure thing--and
there's them 'ull bear witness to't--as i' one regiment where there
was one man a-missing, they put the regimentals on a big monkey,
and they fit him (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) as the shell fits the walnut, and you couldn't tell
the monkey from the mounseers!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Think o' that, now!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poyser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poyser, impressed at once
with the political bearings of the fact and with its striking interest
as an anecdote in natural history.
<div class="bookquote">``Come, Craig,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, <div class="bookquote">``that's a little too strong. You don't
believe that. It's all nonsense about the French being such poor
sticks. Mr. Irwine's seen ’em in their own country, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) says
they've plenty o' fine fellows among ’em. And as for knowledge,
and contrivances, and manufactures, there's a many things as
we're a fine sight behind ’em in. It's poor foolishness to run down
your enemies. Why, Nelson and the rest of ’em 'ud have no merit i'
beating ’em, if they were such offal as folks pretend.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Mr. Poyser looked doubtfully at Mr. Craig, puzzled by this
opposition of authorities. Mr. Irwine's testimony was not to be
disputed; but, on the other hand, Craig was a knowing fellow, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) view was less startling. Martin had never <div class="bookquote">``heard tell''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin Poyser/Martin</b></font>)</div>of the
French being good for much. Mr. Craig had found no answer but
such as was implied in taking a long draught of ale and then
looking down fixedly at the proportions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) own leg, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>)
turned a little outward for that purpose, when Bartle Massey
returned from the fireplace, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) had been smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) first
pipe in quiet, and broke the silence by saying, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>)
forefinger into the canister, ``Why, Adam, how happened you not
to be at church on Sunday? Answer me that, you rascal. The



<p/>688

<p/>anthem went limping without you. Are you going to disgrace your
schoolmaster in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) old age?''
``No, Mr. Massey,'' said Adam. ``Mr. and Mrs. Poyser can tell
you where I was. I was in no bad company.''
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)'s gone, Adam--gone to Snowfield,'' said Mr. Poyser,
reminded of Dinah for the first time this evening. ``I thought you'd
ha' persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) better. Nought 'ud hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) must go
yesterday forenoon. The missis has hardly got over it. I thought
she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>)'d ha' no sperrit for th' harvest supper.''
Mrs. Poyser had thought of Dinah several times since Adam
had come in, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) had had ``no heart'' to mention the bad news.
``What!'' said Bartle, with an air of disgust. ``Was there a woman
concerned? Then I give you up, Adam.''
``But it's a woman you’n spoke well on, Bartle,'' said Mr. Poyser.
``Come now, you canna draw back; you said once as women
wouldna ha' been a bad invention if they'd all been like Dinah.''
``I meant her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) voice, man--I meant her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) voice, that was all,'' said
Bartle. ``I can bear to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) speak without wanting to put wool
in my ears. As for other things, I daresay she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s like the rest o' the
women--thinks two and two 'll come to make five, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) cries and
bothers enough about it.''
``Aye, aye!'' said Mrs. Poyser; ``one 'ud think, an' hear some
folks talk, as the men war 'cute enough to count the corns in a bag
o' wheat wi' only smelling at it. They can see through a barn-door,
they can. Perhaps that's the reason they can see so little o' this side
on't.''
Martin Poyser shook with delighted laughter and winked at
Adam, as much as to say the schoolmaster was in for it now.
``Ah!'' said Bartle sneeringly, ``the women are quick enough--



<p/>689

<p/>they're quick enough. They know the rights of a story before they
hear it, and can tell a man what his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts are before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows
’em himself.''
``Like enough,'' said Mrs. Poyser, ``for the men are mostly so
slow, their thoughts overrun ’em, an' they can only catch ’em by
the tail. I can count a stocking-top while a man's getting's tongue
ready an' when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) outs wi' his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speech at last, there's little broth to
be made on't. It's your dead chicks take the longest hatchin'.
Howiver, I'm not denyin' the women are foolish: God Almighty
made ’em to match the men.''
``Match!'' said Bartle. ``Aye, as vinegar matches one's teeth. If a
man says a word, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife 'll match it with a contradiction; if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a
mind for hot meat, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife 'll match it with cold bacon; if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
laughs, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'ll match him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with whimpering. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s such a match as
the horse-fly is to th' horse: she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s got the right venom to sting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
with--the right venom to sting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with.''
``Yes,'' said Mrs. Poyser, ``I know what the men like--a poor
soft, as 'ud simper at ’em like the picture o' the sun, whether they
did right or wrong, an' say thank you for a kick, an' pretend she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
didna know which end she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stood uppermost, till her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband told
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). That's what a man wants in a wife, mostly; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants to make
sure o' one fool as 'ull tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s wise. But there's some men can
do wi’out that--they think so much o' themselves a'ready. An'
that's how it is there's old bachelors.''
``Come, Craig,'' said Mr. Poyser jocosely, ``you mun get married
pretty quick, else you'll be set down for an old bachelor; an' you
see what the women 'ull think on you.''
``Well,'' said Mr. Craig, willing to conciliate Mrs. Poyser and
setting a high value on his (<font color='blue'><b>Craig</b></font>) own compliments, ``I like a cleverish



<p/>690

<p/>woman--a woman o' sperrit--a managing woman.''
``You're out there, Craig,'' said Bartle, dryly; ``you're out there.
You judge o' your garden-stuff on a better plan than that. You pick
the things for what they can excel in--for what they can excel in.
You don't value your peas for their roots, or your carrots for their
flowers. Now, that's the way you should choose women. Their
cleverness 'll never come to much--never come to much--but they
make excellent simpletons, ripe and strong-flavoured.''
``What dost say to that?'' said Mr. Poyser, throwing himself back
and looking merrily at his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) wife.
``Say!'' answered Mrs. Poyser, with dangerous fire kindling in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) eye. ``Why, I say as some folks' tongues are like the clocks as
run on strikin', not to tell you the time o' the day, but because
there's summat wrong i' their own inside ... ''
Mrs. Poyser would probably have brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) rejoinder to a
further climax, if every one's attention had not at this moment
been called to the other end of the table, where the lyricism, which
had at first only manifested itself by David's sotto voce
performance of ``My love's a rose without a thorn,'' had gradually
assumed a rather deafening and complex character. Tim, thinking
slightly of David's vocalisation, was impelled to supersede that
feeble buzz by a spirited commencement of <div class="bookquote">``Three Merry
Mowers,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>but David was not to be put down so easily, and showed
himself capable of a copious crescendo, which was rendering it
doubtful whether the rose would not predominate over the
mowers, when old Kester, with an entirely unmoved and
immovable aspect, suddenly set up a quavering treble--as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Kester</b></font>)
had been an alarum, and the time was come for him (<font color='blue'><b>Kester</b></font>) to go off.
The company at Alick's end of the table took this form of vocal



<p/>691

<p/>entertainment very much as a matter of course, being free from
musical prejudices; but Bartle Massey laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) pipe and put
his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) fingers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) ears; and Adam, who had been longing to go ever
since he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had heard Dinah was not in the house, rose and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
must bid good-night.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll go with you, lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div>said Bartle; <div class="bookquote">``I'll go with you before my
ears are split.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll go round by the Common and see you home, if you like, Mr.
Massey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam.
<div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div>said Bartle; <div class="bookquote">``then we can have a bit o' talk together.
I never get hold of you now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Eh! It's a pity but you'd sit it out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin Poyser/Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin Poyser. <div class="bookquote">``They'll
all go soon, for th' missis niver lets ’em stay past ten.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>But Adam was resolute, so the good-nights were said, and the
two friends turned out on their starlight walk together.
<div class="bookquote">``There's that poor fool, Vixen, whimpering for me at home,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div>said Bartle. <div class="bookquote">``I can never bring her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) here with me for fear she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)
should be struck with Mrs. Poyser's eye, and the poor bitch might
go limping for ever after.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I've never any need to drive Gyp back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, laughing.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) always turns back of his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) own head when he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) finds out I'm
coming here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bartle/Bartle Massey/Massey</b></font>)</div>said Bartle. <div class="bookquote">``A terrible woman!--made of needles,
made of needles. But I stick to Martin--I shall always stick to
Martin. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) likes the needles, God help him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)'s a cushion
made on purpose for ’em.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s a downright good-natur'd woman, for all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said
Adam, ``and as true as the daylight. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s a bit cross wi' the dogs
when they offer to come in th' house, but if they depended on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),



<p/>692

<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d take care and have ’em well fed. If her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tongue's keen, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
heart's tender: I've seen that in times o' trouble. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s one o' those
women as are better than their word.''
``Well, well,'' said Bartle, <div class="bookquote">``I don't say th' apple isn't sound at the
core; but it sets my teeth on edge--it sets my teeth on edge.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div><p/>693

<p/>Chapter LIV
The Meeting on the Hill

<p/>A

<p/>dam understood Dinah's haste to go away, and drew hope
rather than discouragement from it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was fearful lest
the strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) feeling towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) should hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
from waiting and listening faithfully for the ultimate guiding voice
from within.
<div class="bookquote">``I wish I'd asked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to write to me, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartle</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``And
yet even that might disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a bit, perhaps. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wants to be
quite quiet in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) old way for a while. And I've no right to be
impatient and interrupting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with my wishes. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s told me
what her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind is, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s not a woman to say one thing and
mean another. I'll wait patiently.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>That was Adam's wise resolution, and it throve excellently for
the first two or three weeks on the nourishment it got from the
remembrance of Dinah's confession that Sunday afternoon. There
is a wonderful amount of sustenance in the first few words of love.
But towards the middle of October the resolution began to
dwindle perceptibly, and showed dangerous symptoms of
exhaustion. The weeks were unusually long: Dinah must surely
have had more than enough time to make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) mind. Let a
woman say what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) will after she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) has once told a man that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
loves him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a little too flushed and exalted with that first
draught she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) offers him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to care much about the taste of the second.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) treads the earth with a very elastic step as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walks away from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), and makes light of all difficulties. But that sort of glow dies




<p/>694

<p/>out: memory gets sadly diluted with time, and is not strong enough
to revive us. Adam was no longer so confident as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had been. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
began to fear that perhaps Dinah's old life would have too strong a
grasp upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) for any new feeling to triumph. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had not felt
this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would surely have written to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) some
comfort; but it appeared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) held it right to discourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>).
As Adam's confidence waned, his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) patience waned with it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) must write himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) must ask Dinah not to leave
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) in painful doubt longer than was needful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) sat up late one
night to write her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) a letter, but the next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) burnt it, afraid
of its effect. It would be worse to have a discouraging answer by
letter than from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) own lips, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) presence reconciled him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) will.
You perceive how it was: Adam was hungering for the sight of
Dinah, and when that sort of hunger reaches a certain stage, a
lover is likely to still it though he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) may have to put his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) future in
pawn.
But what harm could he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) do by going to Snowfield? Dinah could
not be displeased with him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) for it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had not forbidden him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) to go.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) must surely expect that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) would go before long. By the
second Sunday in October this view of the case had become so
clear to Adam that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was already on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) way to Snowfield, on
horseback this time, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hours were precious now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had
borrowed Jonathan Burge's good nag for the journey.
What keen memories went along the road with him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had
often been to Oakbourne and back since that first journey to
Snowfield, but beyond Oakbourne the grey stone walls, the broken
country, the meagre trees, seemed to be telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) afresh the
story of that painful past which he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) knew so well by heart. But no



<p/>695

<p/>story is the same to us after a lapse of time--or rather, we who
read it are no longer the same interpreters--and Adam this
morning brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) new thoughts through that grey
country, thoughts which gave an altered significance to its story of
the past.
That is a base and selfish, even a blasphemous, spirit which
rejoices and is thankful over the past evil that has blighted or
crushed another, because it has been made a source of unforeseen
good to ourselves. Adam could never cease to mourn over that
mystery of human sorrow which had been brought so close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>);
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could never thank God for another's misery. And if I were
capable of that narrow-sighted joy in Adam's behalf, I should still
know he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was not the man to feel it for himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would have
shaken his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) head at such a sentiment and said, <div class="bookquote">``Evil's evil, and
sorrow's sorrow, and you can't alter it's natur by wrapping it up in
other words. Other folks were not created for my sake, that I
should think all square when things turn out well for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>But it is not ignoble to feel that the fuller life which a sad
experience has brought us is worth our own personal share of
pain. Surely it is not possible to feel otherwise, any more than it
would be possible for a man with cataract to regret the painful
process by which his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dim blurred sight of men as trees walking
had been exchanged for clear outline and effulgent day. The
growth of higher feeling within us is like the growth of faculty,
bringing with it a sense of added strength. We can no more wish to
return to a narrower sympathy than a painter or a musician can
wish to return to his (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) cruder manner, or a philosopher to his (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) less
complete formula.
Something like this sense of enlarged being was in Adam's



<p/>696

<p/>mind this Sunday morning, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) rode along in vivid recollection
of the past. His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) feeling towards Dinah, the hope of passing his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) life
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), had been the distant unseen point towards which that
hard journey from Snowfield eighteen months ago had been
leading him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). Tender and deep as his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) love for Hetty had been--so
deep that the roots of it would never be torn away--his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) love for
Dinah was better and more precious to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), for it was the
outgrowth of that fuller life which had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
acquaintance with deep sorrow. <div class="bookquote">``It's like as if it was a new
strength to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``to love her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and know as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
loves me. I shall look t' her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to help me to see things right. For she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s
better than I am--there's less o' self in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and pride. And it's a
feeling as gives you a sort o' liberty, as if you could walk more
fearless, when you've more trust in another than y' have in
yourself. I've always been thinking I knew better than them as
belonged to me, and that's a poor sort o' life, when you can't look
to them nearest to you t' help you with a bit better thought than
what you've got inside you a'ready.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was more than two o’clock in the afternoon when Adam came
in sight of the grey town on the hill-side and looked searchingly
towards the green valley below, for the first glimpse of the old
thatched roof near the ugly red mill. The scene looked less harsh
in the soft October sunshine than it had in the eager time of early
spring, and the one grand charm it possessed in common with all
wide-stretching woodless regions--that it filled you with a new
consciousness of the overarching sky--had a milder, more
soothing influence than usual, on this almost cloudless day.
Adam's doubts and fears melted under this influence as the
delicate web-like clouds had gradually melted away into the clear



<p/>697

<p/>blue above him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) seemed to see Dinah's gentle face assuring
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), with its looks alone, of all he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) longed to know.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) did not expect Dinah to be at home at this hour, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) got
down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) horse and tied it at the little gate, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) might ask
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was gone to-day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had set his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mind on following her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
and bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was gone to Sloman's End, a hamlet
about three miles off, over the hill, the old woman told him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)--had
set off directly after morning chapel, to preach in a cottage there,
as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) habit was. Anybody at the town would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) the way to
Sloman's End. So Adam got on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) horse again and rode to the
town, putting up at the old inn and taking a hasty dinner there in
the company of the too chatty landlord, from whose friendly
questions and reminiscences he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was glad to escape as soon as
possible and set out towards Sloman's End. With all his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) haste it
was nearly four o’clock before he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could set off, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought that
as Dinah had gone so early, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would perhaps already be near
returning. The little, grey, desolate-looking hamlet, unscreened by
sheltering trees, lay in sight long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) reached it, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
came near he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could hear the sound of voices singing a hymn.
<div class="bookquote">``Perhaps that's the last hymn before they come away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam
thought. <div class="bookquote">``I'll walk back a bit and turn again to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), farther
off the village.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) walked back till he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) got nearly to the top of the
hill again, and seated himself on a loose stone, against the low
wall, to watch till he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) should see the little black figure leaving the
hamlet and winding up the hill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) chose this spot, almost at the
top of the hill, because it was away from all eyes--no house, no
cattle, not even a nibbling sheep near--no presence but the still
lights and shadows and the great embracing sky.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was much longer coming than he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) expected. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) waited an



<p/>698

<p/>hour at least watching for her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) and thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), while the
afternoon shadows lengthened and the light grew softer. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
saw the little black figure coming from between the grey houses
and gradually approaching the foot of the hill. Slowly, Adam
thought, but Dinah was really walking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) usual pace, with a
light quiet step. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was beginning to wind along the path up
the hill, but Adam would not move yet; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) would not meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) too
soon; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had set his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) heart on meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) in this assured
loneliness. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) began to fear lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) should startle her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) too
much. <div class="bookquote">``Yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s not one to be overstartled; she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s
always so calm and quiet, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was prepared for anything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>What was she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) thinking of as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) wound up the hill? Perhaps
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had found complete repose without him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), and had ceased to
feel any need of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) love. On the verge of a decision we all tremble:
hope pauses with fluttering wings.
But now at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was very near, and Adam rose from the
stone wall. It happened that just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) walked forward, Dinah had
paused and turned round to look back at the village--who does
not pause and look back in mounting a hill? Adam was glad, for,
with the fine instinct of a lover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) felt that it would be best for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) voice before she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) came within three paces
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) and then said, <div class="bookquote">``Dinah!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) started without looking round,
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) connected the sound with no place. <div class="bookquote">``Dinah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam said
again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) knew quite well what was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was so
accustomed to think of impressions as purely spiritual monitions
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) looked for no material visible accompaniment of the
voice.
But this second time she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) looked round. What a look of yearning
love it was that the mild grey eyes turned on the strong dark-eyed



<p/>699

<p/>man! She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) did not start again at the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) said nothing,
but moved towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm could clasp her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) round.
And they walked on so in silence, while the warm tears fell.
Adam was content, and said nothing. It was Dinah who spoke first.
<div class="bookquote">``Adam,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it is the Divine Will. My soul is so knit to
yours that it is but a divided life I live without you. And this
moment, now you are with me, and I feel that our hearts are filled
with the same love. I have a fulness of strength to bear and do our
heavenly Father's Will that I had lost before.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Adam paused and looked into her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) sincere eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``Then we'll never part any more, Dinah, till death parts us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And they kissed each other with a deep joy.
What greater thing is there for two human souls than to feel
that they are joined for life--to strengthen each other in all labour,
to rest on each other in all sorrow, to minister to each other in all
pain, to be one with each other in silent unspeakable memories at
the moment of the last parting?




<p/>700

<p/>Chapter LV
Marriage Bells

<p/>I

<p/>n little more than a month after that meeting on the hill--on a
rimy morning in departing November--Adam and Dinah
were married.
It was an event much thought of in the village. All Mr. Burge's
men had a holiday, and all Mr. Poyser's, and most of those who
had a holiday appeared in their best clothes at the wedding. I
think there was hardly an inhabitant of Hayslope specially
mentioned in this history and still resident in the parish on this
November morning who was not either in church to see Adam and
Dinah married, or near the church door to greet them as they
came forth. Mrs. Irwine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) daughters were waiting at the
churchyard gates in their carriage -LRB-for they had a carriage now-RRB- to
shake hands with the bride and bridegroom and wish them well;
and in the absence of Miss Lydia Donnithorne at Bath, Mrs. Best,
Mr. Mills, and Mr. Craig had felt it incumbent on them to
represent <div class="bookquote">``the family''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Craig/Craig</b></font>)</div>at the Chase on the occasion. The
churchyard walk was quite lined with familiar faces, many of them
faces that had first looked at Dinah when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) preached on the
Green. And no wonder they showed this eager interest on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
marriage morning, for nothing like Dinah and the history which
had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) and Adam Bede together had been known at
Hayslope within the memory of man.
Bessy Cranage, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) neatest cap and frock, was crying, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) did not exactly know why; for, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) cousin Wiry Ben, who



<p/>701

<p/>stood near her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), judiciously suggested, Dinah was not going away,
and if Bessy was in low spirits, the best thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) to do was to
follow Dinah's example and marry an honest fellow who was ready
to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). Next to Bessy, just within the church door, there were
the Poyser children, peeping round the corner of the pews to get a
sight of the mysterious ceremony; Totty's face wearing an unusual
air of anxiety at the idea of seeing cousin Dinah come back looking
rather old, for in Totty's experience no married people were
young.
I envy them all the sight they had when the marriage was fairly
ended and Adam led Dinah out of church. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was not in black
this morning, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) Aunt Poyser would by no means allow such a
risk of incurring bad luck, and had herself made a present of the
wedding dress, made all of grey, though in the usual Quaker form,
for on this point Dinah could not give way. So the lily face looked
out with sweet gravity from under a grey Quaker bonnet, neither
smiling nor blushing, but with lips trembling a little under the
weight of solemn feelings. Adam, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) arm to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) side,
walked with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) old erectness and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) head thrown rather
backward as if to face all the world better. But it was not because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was particularly proud this morning, as is the wont of
bridegrooms, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) happiness was of a kind that had little
reference to men's opinion of it. There was a tinge of sadness in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) deep joy; Dinah knew it, and did not feel aggrieved.
There were three other couples, following the bride and
bridegroom: first, Martin Poyser, looking as cheery as a bright fire
on this rimy morning, led quiet Mary Burge, the bridesmaid; then
came Seth serenely happy, with Mrs. Poyser on his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) arm; and last
of all Bartle Massey, with Lisbeth--Lisbeth in a new gown and



<p/>702

<p/>bonnet, too busy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) pride in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) son and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) delight in
possessing the one daughter she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) had desired to devise a single
pretext for complaint.
Bartle Massey had consented to attend the wedding at Adam's
earnest request, under protest against marriage in general and the
marriage of a sensible man in particular. Nevertheless, Mr. Poyser
had a joke against him (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) after the wedding dinner, to the effect that
in the vestry he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) had given the bride one more kiss than was
necessary.
Behind this last couple came Mr. Irwine, glad at heart over this
good morning's work of joining Adam and Dinah. For he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had seen
Adam in the worst moments of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) sorrow; and what better
harvest from that painful seed-time could there be than this? The
love that had brought hope and comfort in the hour of despair, the
love that had found its way to the dark prison cell and to poor
Hetty's darker soul--this strong gentle love was to be Adam's
companion and helper till death.
There was much shaking of hands mingled with <div class="bookquote">``God bless
you's''  (<font color='red'><b>the couples</b></font>)</div>and other good wishes to the four couples, at the
churchyard gate, Mr. Poyser answering for the rest with unwonted
vivacity of tongue, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) had all the appropriate wedding-day
jokes at his (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) command. And the women, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>) observed, could never
do anything but put finger in eye at a wedding. Even Mrs. Poyser
could not trust herself to speak as the neighbours shook hands
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Poyser</b></font>), and Lisbeth began to cry in the face of the very first
person who told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Lisbeth</b></font>) was getting young again.
Mr. Joshua Rann, having a slight touch of rheumatism, did not
join in the ringing of the bells this morning, and, looking on with
some contempt at these informal greetings which required no



<p/>703

<p/>official co-operation from the clerk, began to hum in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) musical
bass, <div class="bookquote">``Oh what a joyful thing it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>by way of preluding a little to
the effect he (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) intended to produce in the wedding psalm next
Sunday.
<div class="bookquote">``That's a bit of good news to cheer Arthur,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Irwine/Irwine</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Irwine to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) mother, as they drove off. <div class="bookquote">``I shall write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) the first thing
when we get home.''




 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>704

<p/>Epilogue

<p/>I

<p/>t is near the end of June, in 1807. The workshops have been
shut up half an hour or more in Adam Bede's timber-yard,
which used to be Jonathan Burge's, and the mellow evening
light is falling on the pleasant house with the buff walls and the
soft grey thatch, very much as it did when we saw Adam bringing
in the keys on that June evening nine years ago.
There is a figure we know well, just come out of the house, and
shading her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eyes with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hands as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) looks for something in the
distance, for the rays that fall on her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) white borderless cap and her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
pale auburn hair are very dazzling. But now she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) turns away from
the sunlight and looks towards the door.
We can see the sweet pale face quite well now: it is scarcely at
all altered--only a little fuller, to correspond to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) more matronly
figure, which still seems light and active enough in the plain black
dress.
<div class="bookquote">``I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), Seth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>Dinah said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) looked into the house. <div class="bookquote">``Let
us go and meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>). Come, Lisbeth, come with Mother.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a creature</b></font>)</div>The last call was answered immediately by a small fair creature
with pale auburn hair and grey eyes, little more than four years
old, who ran out silently and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hand into her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) mother's.
<div class="bookquote">``Come, Uncle Seth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>said Dinah.
<div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye, we're coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>Seth answered from within, and
presently appeared stooping under the doorway, being taller than
usual by the black head of a sturdy two-year-old nephew, who had
caused some delay by demanding to be carried on uncle's
shoulder.




<p/>705

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better take him (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) on thy arm, Seth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>said Dinah, looking fondly
at the stout black-eyed fellow. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>)'s troublesome to thee so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay: Addy likes a ride on my shoulder. I can carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Addy</b></font>) so
for a bit.''  (<font color='red'><b>Addy</b></font>)</div>A kindness which young Addy acknowledged by
drumming his (<font color='blue'><b>Addy</b></font>) heels with promising force against Uncle Seth's
chest. But to walk by Dinah's side, and be tyrannised over by
Dinah's and Adam's children, was Uncle Seth's earthly happiness.
<div class="bookquote">``Where didst see him (<font color='blue'><b>Addy</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>asked Seth, as they walked on into the
adjoining field. <div class="bookquote">``I can't catch sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Addy</b></font>) anywhere.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Between the hedges by the roadside,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>said Dinah. <div class="bookquote">``I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Addy</b></font>)
hat and his (<font color='blue'><b>Addy</b></font>) shoulder. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Addy</b></font>) is again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Trust thee for catching sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Addy</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Addy</b></font>)'s anywhere to be
seen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Seth, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Thee't like poor mother used to be. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
was always on the look out for Adam, and could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) sooner
than other folks, for all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes got dim.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'s been longer than he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) expected,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>said Dinah, taking
Arthur's watch from a small side pocket and looking at it; <div class="bookquote">``it's
nigh upon seven now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Donnithorne/Donnithorne</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye, they'd have a deal to say to one another,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Seth, <div class="bookquote">``and
the meeting 'ud touch ’em both pretty closish. Why, it's getting on
towards eight years since they parted.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>said Dinah, <div class="bookquote">``Adam was greatly moved this morning at
the thought of the change he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) should see in the poor young man,
from the sickness he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) has undergone, as well as the years which
have changed us all. And the death of the poor wanderer, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was coming back to us, has been sorrow upon sorrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``See, Addy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Seth, lowering the young one to his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) arm now
and pointing, <div class="bookquote">``there's Father coming--at the far stile.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>Dinah hastened her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) steps, and little Lisbeth ran on at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)



<p/>706

<p/>utmost speed till she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) father's leg. Adam patted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
head and lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) up to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), but Dinah could see the marks
of agitation on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) arm
within his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) in silence.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, youngster, must I take you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, trying to smile,
when Addy stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Addy</b></font>) arms--ready, with the usual
baseness of infancy, to give up his (<font color='blue'><b>Addy</b></font>) Uncle Seth at once, now there
was some rarer patronage at hand.
<div class="bookquote">``It's cut me a good deal, Dinah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Adam said at last, when they
were walking on.
<div class="bookquote">``Didst find him (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) greatly altered?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>said Dinah.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>)'s altered and yet not altered. I should ha' known him (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>)
anywhere. But his (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) colour's changed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) looks sadly. However,
the doctors say he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>)'ll soon be set right in his (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) own country air. He (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>)'s
all sound in th' inside; it's only the fever shattered him (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) so. But he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>)
speaks just the same, and smiles at me just as he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) did when he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) was
a lad. It's wonderful how he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>)'s always had just the same sort o' look
when he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) smiles.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I've never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) smile, poor young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>said Dinah.
<div class="bookquote">``But thee wilt see him (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) smile, to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>)
asked after thee the first thing when he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) began to come round, and
we could talk to one another. `I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) isn't altered,' he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) said, `I
remember her (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) face so well.' I told him (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) `no,''' Adam continued,
looking fondly at the eyes that were turned towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), ``only a bit
plumper, as thee'dst a right to be after seven year. `I may come
and see her (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) to-morrow, mayn't I?' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said; `I long to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) how
I've thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) all these years.'''
<div class="bookquote">``Didst tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) I'd always used the watch?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div>said Dinah.
``Aye; and we talked a deal about thee, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) never saw



<p/>707

<p/>a woman a bit like thee. `I shall turn Methodist some day,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said,
`when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) preaches out of doors, and go to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).' And I said,
`Nay, sir, you can't do that, for Conference has forbid the women
preaching, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s given it up, all but talking to the people a bit
in their houses.'''
<div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div>said Seth, who could not repress a comment on this
point, <div class="bookquote">``and a sore pity it was o' Conference; and if Dinah had seen
as I did, we'd ha' left the Wesleyans and joined a body that 'ud put
no bonds on Christian liberty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seth/Seth Bede</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nay, lad, nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>said Adam, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was right and thee wast
wrong. There's no rules so wise but what it's a pity for somebody
or other. Most o' the women do more harm nor good with their
preaching--they've not got Dinah's gift nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) sperrit--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s
seen that, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) thought it right to set th' example o' submitting,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s not held from other sorts o' teaching. And I agree with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), and approve o' what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) did.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div>Seth was silent. This was a standing subject of difference rarely
alluded to, and Dinah, wishing to quit it at once, said, <div class="bookquote">``Didst
remember, Adam, to speak to Colonel Donnithorne the words my
uncle and aunt entrusted to thee?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah/Dinah Morris</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'s going to the Hall Farm with Mr. Irwine the day
after to-morrow. Mr. Irwine came in while we were talking about
it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) would have it as the Colonel must see nobody but thee
to-morrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) said--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)'s in the right of it--as it'll be bad for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) t' have his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) feelings stirred with seeing many people one after
another. `We must get you strong and hearty,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) said, 'that's the
first thing to be done Arthur, and then you shall have your own
way. But I shall keep you under your old tutor's thumb till then.'
Mr. Irwine's fine and joyful at having him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) home again.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Bede/Bede</b></font>)</div><p/>708

<p/>Adam was silent a little while, and then said,
``It was very cutting when we first saw one another. He (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>)'d never
heard about poor Hetty till Mr. Irwine met him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) in London, for the
letters missed him (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) journey. The first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Irwine</b></font>) said to me,
when we'd got hold o' one another's hands was, `I could never do
