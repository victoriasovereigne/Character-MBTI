<p/>Esther Waters

<p/>by

<p/>GEORGE MOORE






<p/>1899


<p/>I


<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) stood on the platform watching the receding train. A few bushes hid
the curve of the line; the white vapour rose above them, evaporating in
the pale evening. A moment more and the last carriage would pass out of
sight. The white gates swung forward slowly and closed over the line.

<p/>An oblong box painted reddish brown and tied with a rough rope lay on the
seat beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). The movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) back and shoulders showed that the
bundle she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) carried was a heavy one, the sharp bulging of the grey linen
cloth that the weight was dead. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wore a faded yellow dress and a black
jacket too warm for the day. A girl of twenty, short, strongly built, with
short, strong arms. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) neck was plump, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair of so ordinary a
brown that it passed unnoticed. The nose was too thick, but the nostrils
were well formed. The eyes were grey, luminous, and veiled with dark
lashes. But it was only when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) laughed that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face lost its habitual
expression, which was somewhat sullen; then it flowed with bright humour.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) laughed now, showing a white line of almond-shaped teeth. The porter
had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were afraid to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bundle with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) box. Both,
he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) said, would go up together in the donkey-cart. The donkey-cart came
down every evening to fetch parcels... That was the way to Woodview,
right up the lane. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could not miss it. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would find the lodge gate in
that clump of trees. The man lingered, for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was an attractive girl, but
the station-master called him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) away to remove some luggage.

<p/>It was a barren country. Once the sea had crawled at high tide half-way up
the sloping sides of those downs. It would do so now were it not for the
shingle bank which its surging had thrown up along the coast. Between the
shingle bank and the shore a weedy river flowed and the little town stood
clamped together, its feet in the water's edge. There were decaying
shipyards about the harbour, and wooden breakwaters stretched long, thin
arms seawards for ships that did not come. On the other side of the
railway apple blossoms showed above a white-washed wall; some market
gardening was done in the low-lying fields, whence the downs rose in
gradual ascents. On the first slope there was a fringe of trees. That was
Woodview.

<p/>The girl gazed on this bleak country like one who saw it for the first
time. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) saw without perceiving, for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind was occupied with personal
consideration. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) found it difficult to decide whether she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should leave
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bundle with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) box. It hung heavy in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not know
how far Woodview was from the station. At the end of the platform the
station-master took her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ticket, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) passed over the level-crossing
still undecided. The lane began with iron railings, laurels, and French
windows. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been in service in such houses, and knew if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were
engaged in any of them what her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) duties would be. But the life in Woodview
was a great dream, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could not imagine herself accomplishing all
that would be required of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). There would be a butler, a footman, and a
page; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would not mind the page--but the butler and footman, what would
they think? There would be an upper-housemaid and an under-housemaid, and
perhaps a lady's-maid, and maybe that these ladies had been abroad with
the family. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had heard of France and Germany. Their conversation would,
no doubt, turn on such subjects. Her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) silence would betray her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>). They would
ask her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) what situations she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had been in, and when they learned the truth
she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) would have to leave disgraced. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had not sufficient money to pay for
a ticket to London. But what excuse could she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) give to Lady Elwin, who had
rescued her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) from Mrs. Dunbar and got her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) the place of kitchen-maid at
Woodview? She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) must not go back. Her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) father would curse her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), and perhaps
beat her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) mother and her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) too. Ah! he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not dare to strike her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) again,
and the girl's face flushed with shameful remembrance. And her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) little
brothers and sisters would cry if she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) came back. They had little enough to
eat as it was. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) must not go back. How silly of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) to think
of such a thing!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) smiled, and her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) face became as bright as the month: it was the first
day of June. Still she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) would be glad when the first week was over. If she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
had only a dress to wear in the afternoons! The old yellow thing on her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
back would never do. But one of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) cotton prints was pretty fresh; she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
must get a bit of red ribbon--that would make a difference. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had heard
that the housemaids in places like Woodview always changed their dresses
twice a day, and on Sundays went out in silk mantles and hats in the
newest fashion. As for the lady's-maid, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) of course had all her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
mistress's clothes, and walked with the butler. What would such people
think of a little girl like her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)! Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart sank at the thought, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
sighed, anticipating much bitterness and disappointment. Even when her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
first quarter's wages came due she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would hardly be able to buy herself a
dress: they would want the money at home. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) quarter's wages! A month's
wages most like, for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'d never be able to keep the place. No doubt all
those fields belonged to the Squire, and those great trees too; they must
be fine folk, quite as fine as Lady Elwin--finer, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Elwin</b></font>) lived in a house
like those near the station.

<p/>On both sides of the straight road there were tall hedges, and the
nursemaids lay in the wide shadows on the rich summer grass, their
perambulators at a little distance. The hum of the town died out of the
ear, and the girl continued to imagine the future she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was about to enter
on with increasing distinctness. Looking across the fields she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could see
two houses, one in grey stone, the other in red brick with a gable covered
with ivy; and between them, lost in the north, the spire of a church. On
questioning a passer-by she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) learnt that the first house was the Rectory,
the second was Woodview Lodge. If that was the lodge, what must the house
be?

<p/>Two hundred yards further on the road branched, passing on either side of
a triangular clump of trees, entering the sea road; and under the leaves
the air was green and pleasant, and the lungs of the jaded town girl drew
in a deep breath of health. Behind the plantation she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) found a large
white-painted wooden gate. It opened into a handsome avenue, and the
gatekeeper told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to keep straight on, and to turn to the left when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
got to the top. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had never seen anything like it before, and stopped
to admire the uncouth arms of elms, like rafters above the roadway; pink
clouds showed through, and the monotonous dove seemed the very heart of
the silence.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) doubts returned; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) never would be able to keep the place. The avenue
turned a little, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came suddenly upon a young man leaning over the
paling, smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pipe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please sir, is this the way to Woodview?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, right up through the stables, round to the left.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then, noticing the
sturdily-built figure, yet graceful in its sturdiness, and the bright
cheeks, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You look pretty well done; that bundle is a heavy one,
let me hold it for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a bit tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, leaning the bundle on the paling. <div class="bookquote">``They told
me at the station that the donkey-cart would bring up my box later on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, then you are the new kitchen-maid? What's your name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Esther Waters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother's the cook here; you'll have to mind your p's and q's or else
you'll be dropped on. The devil of a temper while it lasts, but not a bad
sort if you don't put her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you in service here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but I hope to be afore long. I could have been two years ago, but
mother did not like me to put on livery, and I don't know how I'll face
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) when I come running down to go out with the carriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is the place vacant?''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther asked, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes timidly, looking at
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sideways.

<p/>``Yes, Jim Story got the sack about a week ago. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Story</b></font>) had taken a drop
he (<font color='blue'><b>Story</b></font>)'d tell every blessed thing that was done in the stables. They'd get him (<font color='blue'><b>Story</b></font>)
down to the <div class="bookquote">``Red Lion' for the purpose; of course the squire couldn't
stand that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And shall you take the place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes. I'm not going to spend my life carrying parcels up and down the
King's Road, Brighton, if I can squeeze in here. It isn't so much the
berth that I care about, but the advantages, information fresh from the
fountain-head. You won't catch me chattering over the bar at the <div class="bookquote">``Red
Lion' and having every blessed word I say wired up to London and printed
next morning in all the papers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther wondered what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was talking about, and, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) saw a
low, narrow forehead, a small, round head, a long nose, a pointed chin,
and rather hollow, bloodless cheeks. Notwithstanding the shallow chest, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was powerfully built, the long arms could deal a swinging blow. The low
forehead and the lustreless eyes told of a slight, unimaginative brain,
but regular features and a look of natural honesty made William Latch a
man that ten men and eighteen women out of twenty would like.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see you have got books in that bundle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) said at the end of a long
silence. <div class="bookquote">``Fond of readin'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are mother's books,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) replied, hastily. <div class="bookquote">``I was afraid to leave
them at the station, for it would be easy for anyone to take one out, and
I should not miss it until I undid the bundle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sarah Tucker--that's the upper-housemaid--will be after you to lend them
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tucker</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Tucker</b></font>) is a wonderful reader. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tucker</b></font>) has read every story that has come
out in _Bow Bells_ for the last three years, and you can't puzzle her (<font color='blue'><b>Tucker</b></font>), try
as you will. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tucker</b></font>) knows all the names, can tell you which lord it was that
saved the girl from the carriage when the `osses were tearing like mad
towards a precipice a `undred feet deep, and all about the baronet for
whose sake the girl went out to drown herself in the moonlight, I `aven't
read the books mesel', but Sarah and me are great pals,''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther trembled lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) might ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) again if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) were fond of reading;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not read. Noticing a change in the expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>)
concluded that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was disappointed to hear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) liked Sarah and
regretted his (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) indiscretion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good friends, you know--no more. Sarah and me never hit it off; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) will
worry me with the stories she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) reads. I don't know what is your taste, but
I likes something more practical; the little `oss in there, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is more to
my taste.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Fearing he (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) might speak again of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) books, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) mustered up
courage and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They told me at the station that the donkey-cart would bring up my box.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The donkey-cart isn't going to the station to-night--you'll want your
things, to be sure. I'll see the coachman; perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is going down with
the trap. But, golly! it has gone the half-hour. I shall catch it for
keeping you talking, and my mother has been expecting you for the last
hour. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hasn't a soul to help her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and six people coming to dinner. You
must say the train was late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>cried Esther. <div class="bookquote">``Will you show me the way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Over the iron gate which opened into the pleasure-ground, thick branches
of evergreen oaks made an arch of foliage, and between the trees a glimpse
was caught of the angles and urns of an Italian house--distant about a
hundred yards. A high brick wall separated the pleasure-ground from the
stables, and as William and Esther turned to the left and walked up the
roadway he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) explained that the numerous buildings were stables. They passed
by many doors, hearing the trampling of horses and the rattling of chains.
Then the roadway opened into a handsome yard overlooked by the house, the
back premises of which had been lately rebuilt in red brick. There were
gables and ornamental porches, and through the large kitchen windows the
servants were seen passing to and fro. At the top of this yard was a gate.
It led into the park, and, like the other gate, was overhung by bunched
evergreens. A string of horses came towards this gate, and William ran to
open it. The horses were clothed in grey cloth. They wore hoods, and
Esther noticed the black round eyes looking through the eyelet holes. They
were ridden by small, ugly boys, who swung their little legs, and struck
them with ash plants when they reached their heads forward chawing at the
bits. When William returned he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Look there, the third one; that's
he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)--that's Silver Braid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>An impatient knocking at the kitchen window interrupted his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) admiration,
and William, turning quickly, said, <div class="bookquote">``Mind you say the train was late;
don't say I kept you, or you'll get me into the devil of a pickle. This
way.''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>The door let into a wide passage covered with coconut matting. They
walked a few yards; the kitchen was the first door, and the handsome room
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) found herself in did not conform to anything that Esther had seen or
heard of kitchens. The range almost filled one end of the room, and on it
a dozen saucepans were simmering; the dresser reached to the ceiling, and
was covered with a multitude of plates and dishes. Esther thought how she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
must strive to keep it in its present beautiful condition, and the elegant
white-capped servants passing round the white table made her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) own
insignificance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the new kitchen-maid, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, is it indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Latch looking up from the tray of tartlets
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had taken from the oven and was filling with jam. Esther noticed
the likeness that Mrs. Latch bore to her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) son. The hair was iron grey, and,
as in William's face, the nose was the most prominent feature.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you'll tell me the train was late?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mother, the train was a quarter of an hour late,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>William chimed in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't ask you, you idle, lazy, good-for-nothing vagabond. I suppose it
was you who kept the girl all this time. Six people coming to dinner, and
I've been the whole day without a kitchen-maid. If Margaret Gale hadn't
come down to help me, I don't know where we should be; as it is, the
dinner will be late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The housemaids</b></font>)</div><p/>The two housemaids, both in print dresses, stood listening. Esther's face
clouded, and when Mrs. Latch told her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) things off and set to
and prepare the vegetables, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) might see what she (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) was made of,
Esther did not answer at once. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) turned away, saying under her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) breath,
<div class="bookquote">``I must change my dress, and my box has not come up from the station yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can tuck your dress up, and Margaret Gale will lend you her (<font color='blue'><b>Gale</b></font>) apron.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther hesitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What you've got on don't look as if it could come to much damage. Come,
now, set to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The housemaids</b></font>)</div><p/>The housemaids burst into loud laughter, and then a sullen look of dogged
obstinacy passed over and settled on Esther's face, even to the point of
visibly darkening the white and rose complexion.




<p/>II


<p/>A sloping roof formed one end of the room, and through a broad, single
pane the early sunlight fell across a wall papered with blue and white
flowers. Print dresses hung over the door. On the wall were two
pictures--a girl with a basket of flowers, the coloured supplement of an
illustrated newspaper, and an old and dilapidated last century print. On
the chimney-piece there were photographs of the Gale family in Sunday
clothes, and the green vases that Sarah had given Margaret on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
birthday.

<p/>And in a low, narrow iron bed, pushed close against the wall in the full
glare of the sunlight, Esther lay staring half-awake, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes open but
still dim with dreams. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looked at the clock. It was not yet time to get
up, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) arms as if to cross them behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) head, but a
sudden remembrance of yesterday arrested her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) movement, and a sudden shadow
settled on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had refused to prepare the vegetables. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hadn't
answered, and the cook had turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) out of the kitchen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had rushed
from the house under the momentary sway of hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) might succeed in
walking back to London; but William had overtaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) in the avenue, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
had expostulated with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had refused to allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to pass. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had
striven to tear herself from him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and, failing, had burst into tears.
However, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had been kind, and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
back, and all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) ears with assurances that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
would make it all right with his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother. But Mrs. Latch had closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
kitchen against her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had had to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) room. Even if they paid
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) fare back to London, how was she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to face her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mother? What would father
say? He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) from the house. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had done nothing wrong.
Why did cook insult her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)?

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) pulled on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) stockings she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) stopped and wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) should
awake Margaret Gale. Margaret's bed stood in the shadow of the obliquely
falling wall; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lay heavily, one arm thrown forward, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) short,
square face raised to the light. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) slept so deeply that for a moment
Esther felt afraid. Suddenly the eyes opened, and Margaret looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
vaguely, as if out of eternity. Raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What time is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has just gone six.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then there's plenty of time; we needn't be down before seven. You get on
with your dressing; there's no use in my getting up till you are
done--we'd be tumbling over each other. This is no room to put two girls
to sleep in--one glass not much bigger than your hand. You'll have to get
your box under your bed... In my last place I had a beautiful room with a
Brussels carpet, and a marble washstand. I wouldn't stay here three days
if it weren't--''  (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div>The girl laughed and turned lazily over.

<p/>Esther did not answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, isn't it a grubby little room to put two girls to sleep in? What was
your last place like?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther answered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had hardly been in service before. Margaret was
too much engrossed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own thoughts to notice the curtness of the
answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's only one thing to be said for Woodview, and that is the eating;
we have anything we want, and we'd have more than we want if it weren't
for the old cook: she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) must have her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) little bit out of everything and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
cuts us short in our bacon in the morning. But that reminds me! You have
set the cook against you; you'll have to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) over to your side if
you want to remain here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I be asked to wash up the moment I came in the house, before
even I had time to change my dress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was hard on you. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) always gets as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) can out of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
kitchen-maid. But last night she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was pressed, there was company to dinner.
I'd have lent you an apron, and the dress you had on wasn't of much
account.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't because a girl is poor--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Gale/Gale</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I didn't mean that; I know well enough what it is to be hard up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Gale/Gale</b></font>)</div>Margaret clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) stays across her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) plump figure and walked to the door
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) dress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was a pretty girl, with a snub nose and large, clear
eyes. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hair was lighter in tone than Esther's, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had brushed it
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) forehead so as to obviate the defect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) face, which was too
short.

<p/>Esther was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knees saying her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) prayers when Margaret turned to the
light to button her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) boots.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I never!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think prayers any good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther looked up angrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to say anything against saying prayers, but I wouldn't
before the others if I was you--they'll chaff dreadful, and call you
Creeping Jesus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Margaret, I hope they won't do anything so wicked. But I am afraid I
shan't be long here, so it doesn't matter what they think of _me_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Gale/Gale</b></font>)</div><p/>When they got downstairs they opened the windows and doors, and Margaret
took Esther round, showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) where the things were kept, and telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
for how many she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) must lay the table. At that moment a number of boys and
men came clattering up the passage. They cried to Esther to hurry up,
declaring that they were late. Esther did not know who they were, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
served them as best she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) might. They breakfasted hastily and rushed away to
the stables; and they had not been long gone when the squire and his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) son
Arthur appeared in the yard. The Gaffer, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) was called, was a man of
about medium height. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) wore breeches and gaiters, and in them his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) legs
seemed grotesquely thick. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) son was a narrow-chested, undersized young
man, absurdly thin and hatchet-faced. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) was also in breeches and gaiters,
and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) boots were attached long-necked spurs. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) pale yellow hair
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) a somewhat ludicrous appearance, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) stood talking to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>)
father, but the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) prepared to get into the saddle he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) seemed quite
different. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) rode a beautiful chestnut horse, a little too thin, Esther
thought, and the ugly little boys were mounted on horses equally thin. The
squire rode a stout grey cob, and he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) watched the chestnut, and was also
interested in the brown horse that walked with its head in the air,
pulling at the smallest of all the boys, a little freckled, red-headed
fellow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's Silver Braid, the brown horse, the one that the Demon is riding;
the chestnut is Bayleaf, Ginger is riding him (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) won the City and
Suburban. Oh, we did have a fine time then, for we all had a bit on. The
betting was twenty to one, and I won twelve and six pence. Grover won
thirty shillings. They say that John--that's the butler--won a little
fortune; but he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) is so close no one knows what he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) has on. Cook wouldn't
have anything on; she (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) says that betting is the curse of servants--you know
what is said, that it was through betting that Mrs. Latch's husband got
into trouble. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was steward here, you know, in the late squire's time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Gale/Gale</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Margaret told all she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had heard on the subject. The late Mr. Latch
had been a confidential steward, and large sums of money were constantly
passing through his (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>) hands for which he (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>) was never asked for any exact
account. Contrary to all expectation, Marksman was beaten for the Chester
Cup, and the squire's property was placed under the charge of a receiver.
Under the new management things were gone into more closely, and it was
then discovered that Mr. Latch's accounts were incapable of satisfactory
explanation. The defeat of Marksman had hit Mr. Latch as hard as it had
hit the squire, and to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) debts of honour he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) had to take from the
money placed in his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) charge, confidently hoping to return it in a few
months. The squire's misfortunes anticipated the realization of his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>)
intentions; proceedings were threatened, but were withdrawn when Mrs.
Latch came forward with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) savings and volunteered to forego her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>)
wages for a term of years. Old Latch died soon after, some lucky bets set
the squire on his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) legs again, the matter was half forgotten, and in the
next generation it became the legend of the Latch family. But to Mrs.
Latch it was an incurable grief, and to remove her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) son from influences
which, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) opinion, had caused his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father's death, Mrs. Latch had
always refused Mr. Barfield's offers to do something for William. It was
against her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) will that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had been taught to ride; but to her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) great joy he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
soon grew out of all possibility of becoming a jockey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) had then placed
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) in an office in Brighton; but the young man's height and shape marked
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out for livery, and Mrs. Latch was pained when Mr. Barfield proposed
it. <div class="bookquote">``Why cannot they leave me my son?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) cried; for it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>)
that in that hateful cloth, buttons and cockade, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) would be no more her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>)
son, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) could not forget what the Latches had been long ago.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe there's going to be a trial this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Gale/Gale</b></font>)</div>said Margaret;
<div class="bookquote">``Silver Braid was stripped--you noticed that--and Ginger always rides in
the trials.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Gale/Gale</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what a trial is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther. <div class="bookquote">``They are not
carriage-horses, are they? They look too slight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Carriage-horses, you ninny! Where have you been to all this while--can't
you see that they are race-horses?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther hung down her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) head and murmured something which Margaret didn't
catch.

<p/>``To tell the truth, I didn't know much about them when I came, but then
one never hears anything else here. And that reminds me--it is as much as
your place is worth to breathe one syllable about them horses; you must
know nothing when you are asked. That's what Jim Story got sacked
for--saying in the <div class="bookquote">``Red Lion' that Valentine pulled up lame. We don't know
how it came to the Gaffer's ears. I believe that it was Mr. Leopold that
told; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) finds out everything. But I was telling you how I learnt about
the race-horses. It was from Jim Story--Jim was my pal--Sarah is after
William, you know, the fellow who brought you into the kitchen last night.
Jim could never talk about anything but the `osses. We'd go every night
and sit in the wood-shed, that's to say if it was wet; if it was fine we'd
walk in the drove-way. I'd have married Jim, I know I should, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) hadn't
been sent away. That's the worst of being a servant. They sent Jim away
just as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was a dog. It was wrong of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) to say the horse pulled up
lame; I admit that, but they needn't have sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) away as they did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther was absorbed in the consideration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) own perilous position.
Would they send her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) away at the end of the week, or that very afternoon?
Would they give her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) a week's wages, or would they turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) out destitute
to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) way back to London as best she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) might? What should she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) do if
they turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) out-of-doors that very afternoon? Walk back to London? She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
did not know if that was possible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not know how far she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had
come--a long distance, no doubt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had seen woods, hills, rivers, and
towns flying past. Never would she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) be able to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) way back through
that endless country; besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) box on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) back...
What was she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to do? Not a friend, not a penny in the world. Oh, why did
such misfortune fall on a poor little girl who had never harmed anyone in
the world! And if they did give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fare back--what then?... Should
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) go home?... To her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother--to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) poor mother, who would burst into
tears, who would say, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my poor darling, I don't know what we shall do;
your father will never let you stay here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>For Mrs. Latch had not spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) since she (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) had come into the kitchen,
and it seemed to Esther that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had looked round with the air of one
anxious to discover something that might serve as a pretext for blame. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
had told Esther to make haste and lay the table afresh. Those who had gone
were the stable folk, and breakfast had now to be prepared for the other
servants. The person in the dark green dress who spoke with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) chin in
the air, whose nose had been pinched to purple just above the nostrils,
was Miss Grover, the lady's-maid. Grover addressed an occasional remark to
Sarah Tucker, a tall girl with a thin freckled face and dark-red hair. The
butler, who was not feeling well, did not appear at breakfast, and Esther
was sent to him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) with a cup of tea.

<p/>There were the plates to wash and the knives to clean, and when they were
done there were potatoes, cabbage, onions to prepare, saucepans to fill
with water, coal to fetch for the fire. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) worked steadily without
flagging, fearful of Mrs. Barfield, who would come down, no doubt, about
ten o'clock to order dinner. The race-horses were coming through the
paddock-gate; Margaret called to Mr. Randal, a little man, wizen, with a
face sallow with frequent indigestions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, do you think the Gaffer's satisfied?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Gale/Gale</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. John made no
articulate reply, but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) muttered something, and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) manner showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
strongly deprecated all female interest in racing; and when Sarah and
Grover came running down the passage and overwhelmed him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) with questions,
crowding around him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), asking both together if Silver Braid had won his (<font color='blue'><b>Braid</b></font>)
trial, he (<font color='blue'><b>Braid</b></font>) testily pushed them aside, declaring that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Braid</b></font>) had a race-horse
he (<font color='blue'><b>Braid</b></font>) would not have a woman-servant in the place... <div class="bookquote">``A positive curse, this
chatter, chatter. Won his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) trial, indeed! What business had a lot of female
folk--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The rest of John's sarcasm was lost in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) shirt collar as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
hurried away to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) pantry, closing the door after him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a testy little man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>said Sarah; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have told us which
won. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has known the Gaffer so long that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looks at
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whether the gees are all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One can't speak to a chap in the lane that he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) doesn't know all about it
next day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Gale/Gale</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Peggy hates him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>); you know the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) skulks
about the back garden and up the `ill so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) may meet young Johnson
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) is ridin' home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll have none of this scandal-mongering going on in my kitchen,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Latch. <div class="bookquote">``Do you see that girl there? She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) can't get past to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
scullery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther would have managed pretty well if it had not been for the
dining-room lunch. Miss Mary was expecting some friends to play tennis
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and, besides the roast chicken, there were the côtelettes à la
Soubise and a curry. There was for dessert a jelly and a blancmange, and
Esther did not know where any of the things were, and a great deal of time
was wasted. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you move, I might as well get it myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old
woman. Mr. Randal, too, lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) temper, for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no hot plates ready,
nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) distinguish between those that were to go to the dining-room
and those that were to go to the servants' hall. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) understood, however,
that it would not be wise to give way to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feeling, and that the only
way she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could hope to retain her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) situation was by doing nothing to attract
attention. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must learn to control that temper of hers--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must and
would. And it was in this frame of mind and with this determination that
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) entered the servants' hall.

<p/>There were not more than ten or eleven at dinner, but sitting close
together they seemed more numerous, and quite half the number of faces
that looked up as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) place next to Margaret Gale, were unknown
to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). There were the four ugly little boys whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had seen on the race
horses, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not recognize them at first, and nearly opposite,
sitting next to the lady's-maid, was a small, sandy-haired man about
forty: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was beginning to show signs of stoutness, and two little round
whiskers grew out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pallid cheeks. Mr. Randal sat at the end of the
table helping the pudding. He (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) addressed the sandy-haired man as Mr.
Swindles; but Esther learnt afterwards his (<font color='blue'><b>Swindles</b></font>) real name was Ward, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Swindles</b></font>)
was Mr. Barfield's head groom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) learnt, too, that <div class="bookquote">``the Demon''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>was not
the real name of the little carroty-haired boy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in
amazement when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) whispered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) ear that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would dearly love a real
go-in at that pudding, but that it was so fattening that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) didn't ever
dare to venture on more than a couple of sniffs. Seeing that the girl did
not understand, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) added, by way of explanation, <div class="bookquote">``You know that I must
keep under the six stone, and at times it becomes awful `ard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther thought him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a nice little fellow, and tried to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to
forego his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) resolution not to touch pudding, until Mr. Swindles told her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to
desist. The attention of the whole table being thus drawn towards the boy,
Esther was still further surprised at the admiration he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seemed so easily
to command and the important position he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seemed to occupy, notwithstanding
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) diminutive stature, whereas the bigger boys were treated with very
little consideration. The long-nosed lad, with weak eyes and sloping
shoulders, who sat on the other side of the table on Mr. Swindles' left,
was everybody's laughing-stock, especially Mr. Swindles', who did not
cease to poke fun at him (<font color='blue'><b>Swindles</b></font>). Mr. Swindles was now telling poor Jim's
misadventures with the Gaffer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why do you call him (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) Mr. Leopold when his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) name is Mr. Randal?''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther
ventured to inquire of the Demon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On account of Leopold Rothschild,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Demon</b></font>)</div>said the Demon; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Rothschild</b></font>)'s pretty near as
rich, if the truth was known--won a pile over the City and Sub. Pity you
weren't there; might have had a bit on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Demon</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never seen the City,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther replied innocently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never seen the City and Sub!... I was up, had a lot in hand, so I came
away from my `orses the moment I got into the dip. The Tinman nearly
caught me on the post--came with a terrific rush; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rothschild</b></font>) is just hawful, that
Tinman is. I did catch it from the Gaffer--he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) did give it me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div><p/>The plates of all the boys except the Demon's were now filled with
beefsteak pudding, potatoes, and greens, likewise Esther's. Mr. Leopold,
Mr. Swindles, the housemaid, and the cook dined off the leg of mutton, a
small slice of which was sent to the Demon. <div class="bookquote">``That for a dinner!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>)
took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) knife and fork and cut a small piece of his (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) one slice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you never had to reduce yourself three pounds; girls
never have. I do run to flesh so, you wouldn't believe it. If I don't walk
to Portslade and back every second day, I go up three or four pounds. Then
there's nothing for it but the physic, and that's what settles me. Can you
take physic?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I took three Beecham's pills once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's nothing. Can you take castor-oil?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther looked in amazement at the little boy at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) side. Swindles had
overheard the question and burst into a roar of laughter. Everyone wanted
to know what the joke was, and, feeling they were poking fun at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>),
Esther refused to answer.

<p/>The first helpings of pudding or mutton had taken the edge off their
appetites, and before sending their plates for more they leaned over the
table listening and laughing open-mouthed. It was a bare room, lit with
one window, against which Mrs. Latch's austere figure appeared in
dark-grey silhouette. The window looked on one of the little back courts
and tiled ways which had been built at the back of the house; and the
shadowed northern light softened the listening faces with grey tints.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Swindles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Swindles, glancing at Jim as if to assure himself
that the boy was there and unable to escape from the hooks of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sarcasm,
``how fast the Gaffer talks, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) hates to be asked to repeat his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>)
words. Knowing this, Jim always says, ``Yes, sir; yes, sir.'' ``Now do you
quite understand?'' says the Gaffer. ``Yes, sir; yes, sir,'' replies Jim, not
having understood one word of what was said; but relying on us to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
right. ``Now what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) say I was to do?'' says Jim, the moment the Gaffer
is out of hearing. But this morning we were on ahead, and the Gaffer had
Jim all to himself. As usual he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) says, ``Now do you quite understand?'' and
as usual Jim says, ``Yes, sir; yes, sir.'' Suspecting that Jim had not
understood, I said when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) joined us, ``Now if you are not sure what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
said you had better go back and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>),'' but Jim declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had
perfectly understood. ``And what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) tell you to do?'' said I. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) told
me,<div class="bookquote">'' says Jim, `to bring the colt along and finish up close by where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
would be standing at the end of the track.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I thought it rather odd to
send Firefly such a stiff gallop as all that, but Jim was certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
had heard right. And off they went, beginning the other side of Southwick
Hill. I saw the Gaffer with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) arms in the air, and don't know now what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) said. Jim will tell you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) did give it you, didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), you old
Woolgatherer?'' said Mr. Swindles, slapping the boy on the shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may laugh as much as you please, but I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) did tell me to come
along three-quarter speed after passing the barn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Story</b></font>)</div>replied Jim, and to
change the conversation he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) asked Mr. Leopold for some more pudding, and
the Demon's hungry eyes watched the last portion being placed on the
Woolgatherer's plate. Noticing that Esther drank no beer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) exclaimed--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I never; to see yer eat and drink one would think that it was you
who was a-wasting to ride the crack at Goodwood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The remark was received with laughter, and, excited by his (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) success, the
Demon threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) arms round Esther, and seizing her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hands, said, <div class="bookquote">``Now yer a
jest beginning to get through yer `osses, and when you get on a level--''
 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>But the Demon, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) hungry merriment, had bestowed no thought of finding
a temper in such a staid little girl, and a sound box on the ear threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>)
backwards into his (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) seat surprised and howling. <div class="bookquote">``Yer nasty thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>)
blubbered out. <div class="bookquote">``Couldn't you see it was only a joke?''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>But passion was hot
in Esther. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had understood no word that had been said since she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had sat
down to dinner, and, conscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) poverty and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) ignorance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
imagined that a great deal of the Demon's conversation had been directed
against her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>); and, choking with indignation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) only heard indistinctly
the reproaches with which the other little boys covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``nasty,
dirty, ill-tempered thing, scullery-maid,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>etc.; nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) understand
their whispered plans to duck her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) passed the stables. All looked
a little askance, especially Grover and Mr. Leopold. Margaret said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That will teach these impertinent little jockey-boys that the servants'
hall is not the harness-room; they oughtn't to be admitted here at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Gale/Gale</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Leopold nodded, and told the Demon to leave off blubbering. <div class="bookquote">``You can't
be so much hurt as all that. Come, wipe your eyes and have a piece of
currant tart, or leave the room. I want to hear from Mr. Swindles an
account of the trial. We know that Silver Braid won, but we haven't heard
how he (<font color='blue'><b>Braid</b></font>) won nor yet what the weights were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Swindles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Swindles, <div class="bookquote">``what I makes out is this. I was riding within
a pound or two of nine stone, and The Rake is, as you know, seven pounds,
no more, worse than Bayleaf. Ginger rides usually as near as possible my
weight--we'll say he (<font color='blue'><b>Braid</b></font>) was riding nine two--I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Braid</b></font>) could manage
that--and the Demon, we know, he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) is now riding over the six stone; in his (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>)
ordinary clothes he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) rides six seven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Swindles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, but how do we know that there was any lead to speak of in the
Demon's saddle-cloth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Demon says there wasn't above a stone. Don't you, Demon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know nothing! I'm not going to stand being clouted by the
kitchen-maid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, shut up, or leave the room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leopold</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Leopold; <div class="bookquote">``we don't want to hear
any more about that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leopold</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I started making the running according to orders. Ginger was within
three-quarters of a length of me, being pulled out of the saddle. The
Gaffer was standing at the three-quarters of the mile, and there Ginger
won fairly easily, but they went on to the mile--them were the orders--and
there the Demon won by half a length, that is to say if Ginger wasn't
a-kidding of him (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A-kidding of me!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Demon</b></font>)</div>said the Demon. <div class="bookquote">``When we was a hundred yards from `ome
I steadied without his (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) noticing me, and then I landed in the last fifty
yards by half a length. Ginger can't ride much better than any other
gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yer see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Swindles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Swindles, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'d sooner have a box on the ear from the
kitchen-maid than be told a gentleman could kid him (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) at a finish. He (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>)
wouldn't mind if it was the Tinman, eh, Demon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Swindles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leopold</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Leopold, <div class="bookquote">``that Bayleaf can get the mile; there must
have been a lot of weight between them. Besides, I should think that the
trial was at the three-quarters of the mile. The mile was so much kid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leopold</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Swindles</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Swindles, <div class="bookquote">``that the `orses were tried at
twenty-one pounds, and if Silver Braid can beat Bayleaf at that weight,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>)'ll take a deal of beating at Goodwood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Swindles</b></font>)</div><p/>And leaning forward, their arms on the table, with large pieces of cheese
at the end of their knives, the maid-servants and the jockey listened
while Mr. Leopold and Mr. Swindles discussed the chances the stable had of
pulling off the Stewards' Cup with Silver Braid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) will always keep on trying them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Swindles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Swindles, <div class="bookquote">``and what's

after. If I had my way with them gentry--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Swindles</b></font>)</div>Mr. Swindles finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Swindles</b></font>)
beer at a gulp, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Swindles</b></font>) put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Swindles</b></font>) glass as firmly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Swindles</b></font>) desired to put
down the horse watchers. At the end of a long silence Mr. Leopold said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come into my pantry and smoke a pipe. Mr. Arthur will be down presently.
Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)'ll tell us what weight he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was riding this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leopold</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cunning old bird,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Swindles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Swindles, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Swindles</b></font>) rose from the table and wiped

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Leopold laughed under his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) breath, and looking mysterious and very
rat-like he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) led the way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) pantry. Esther watched them in strange
trouble of soul. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had heard of racecourses as shameful places where men
were led to their ruin, and betting she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had always understood to be
sinful, but in this house no one seemed to think of anything else. It was
no place for a Christian girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's have some more of the story,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Gale/Gale</b></font>)</div>Margaret said. <div class="bookquote">``You've got the new

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/>Sarah took an illustrated journal out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) pocket and began to read
aloud.




<p/>III


<p/>Esther was one of the Plymouth Brethren. In their chapel, if the house in
which they met could be called a chapel, there were neither pictured
stories of saints, nor vestments, nor music, nor even imaginative
stimulant in the shape of written prayers. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knowledge of life was
strictly limited to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) experience of life; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knew no drama of passion
except that which the Gospels relate: this story in the _Family Reader_
was the first representation of life she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had met with, and its humanity
thrilled her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) like the first idol set up for worship. The actress told
Norris that she (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>). They were on a balcony, the sky was blue, the
moon was shining, the warm scent of the mignonette came up from the garden
below, the man was in evening dress with diamond shirt studs, the
actress's arm was large and white. They had loved each other for years.
The strangest events had happened for the purpose of bringing them
together, and, fascinated against her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) will, Esther could not but listen.
But at the end of the chapter the racial instinct forced reproval from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure it is wicked to read such tales.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/>Sarah looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) in mute astonishment. Grover said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't be here at all. Can't Mrs. Latch find nothing for you to do
in the scullery?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Miss Grover</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>said Sarah, awaking to a sense of the situation, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose that
where you come from you were not so much as allowed to read a tale;
... dirty little chapel-going folk!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/>The incident might have closed with this reproval had not Margaret
volunteered the information that Esther's box was full of books.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to see them books,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>said Sarah. <div class="bookquote">``I'll be bound that they
are only prayer-books.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind what you say to me, but you shall not insult my religion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Insult your religion! I said you never had read a book in your life
unless it was a prayer-book.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We don't use prayer-books.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what books have you read?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther hesitated, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) manner betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and, suspecting the truth,
Sarah said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe that you can read at all. Come, I'll bet you twopence
that you can't read the first five lines of my story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther pushed the paper from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) and walked out of the room in a tumult of
grief and humiliation. Woodview and all belonging to it had grown
unbearable, and heedless to what complaint the cook might make against her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) ran upstairs and shut herself into her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) asked why they should
take pleasure in torturing her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). It was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) fault if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not know
how to read. There were the books she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) loved for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mother's sake, the
books that had brought such disgrace upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). Even the names she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could
not read, and the shame of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) ignorance lay upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heavier than a
weight of lead. <div class="bookquote">``Peter Parley's Annual,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lamb</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sunny Memories of Foreign
Lands,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lamb</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Children of the Abbey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lamb</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Uncle Tom's Cabin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lamb</b></font>)</div>Lamb's <div class="bookquote">``Tales of
Shakespeare's Plays,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lamb</b></font>)</div>a Cooking Book, <div class="bookquote">``Roda's Mission of Love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lamb</b></font>)</div>the Holy
Bible and the Common Prayer Book.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) turned them over, wondering what were the mysteries that this print
held from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). It was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mysterious as the stars.

<p/>Esther Waters came from Barnstaple. She (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) had been brought up in the
strictness of the Plymouth Brethren, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) earliest memories were of
prayers, of narrow, peaceful family life. This early life had lasted till
she (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) was ten years old. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) father died. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been a house-painter,
but in early youth he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been led into intemperance by some wild
companions. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was often not in a fit state to go to work, and one day the
fumes of the beer he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had drunk overpowered him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sat in the strong
sunlight on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) scaffolding. In the hospital he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) called upon God to relieve
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) suffering; then the Brethren said, <div class="bookquote">``You never thought of God
before. Be patient, your health is coming back; it is a present from God;
you would like to know Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and thank Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) from the bottom of your heart?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Plymouth Brethren/Brethren</b></font>)</div><p/>John Waters' heart was touched. He (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) became one of the Brethren, renouncing
those companions who refused to follow into the glory of God. His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
conversion and subsequent grace won for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) the sympathies of Mary
Thornby. But Mary's father would not consent to the marriage unless John
abandoned his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) dangerous trade of house-painter. John Waters consented to
do this, and old James Thornby, who had made a competence in the curiosity
line, offered to make over his (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) shop to the young couple on certain
conditions; these conditions were accepted, and under his (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) father-in-law's
direction John drove a successful trade in old glass, old jewellery, and
old furniture.

<p/>The Brethren liked not this trade, and they often came to John to speak
with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) on the subject, and their words were--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course this is between you and the Lord, but these things''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>-LRB-pointing
to the old glass and jewellery-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``often are but snares for the feet, and
lead weaker brethren into temptation. Of course, it is between you and the
Lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>So John Waters was tormented with scruples concerning the righteousness of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) trade, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) wife's gentle voice and eyes, and the limitations that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) accident, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) had never wholly recovered, had set upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>)
life, overruled his (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) scruples, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) remained until he (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) died a dealer in
artistic ware, eliminating, however, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) dealings those things to
which the Brethren most strongly objected.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) died his (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) widow strove to carry on the business, but her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) father,
who was now a confirmed invalid, could not help her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>). In the following year
she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) lost both her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) parents. Many changes were taking place in Barnstaple,
new houses were being built, a much larger and finer shop had been opened
in the more prosperous end of the town, and Mrs. Waters found herself
obliged to sell her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) business for almost nothing, and marry again. Children
were born of this second marriage in rapid succession, the cradle was
never empty, and Esther was spoken of as the little nurse.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) great solicitude was for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) poor mother, who had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) health,
whose blood was impoverished by constant child-bearing. Mother and
daughter were seen in the evenings, one with a baby at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) breast, the
other with an eighteen months old child in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) arms. Esther did not dare
leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mother, and to protect her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) gave up school, and this was why
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had never learnt how to read.

<p/>One of the many causes of quarrel between Mrs. Saunders and her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) husband
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) attendance at prayer-meetings when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) should be at home
minding her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) children. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) used to accuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) of carrying on with the
Scripture-readers, and to punish her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``This week I'll spend
five bob more in the public--that'll teach you, if beating won't, that I
don't want none of your hypocritical folk hanging round my place.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So it
befell the Saunders family to have little to eat; and Esther often
wondered how she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) should get a bit of dinner for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sick mother and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
hungry little brothers and sisters. Once they passed nearly thirty hours
without food. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) called them round her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and knelt down amid them: they
prayed that God might help them; and their prayers were answered, for at
half-past twelve a Scripture lady came in with flowers in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
asked Mrs. Saunders how her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) appetite was. Mrs. Saunders answered that it
was more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) could afford, for there was nothing to eat in the house.
Then the Scripture lady gave them eighteen pence, and they all knelt down
and thanked God together.

<p/>But although Saunders spent a great deal of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) money in the public-house,
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) rarely got drunk and always kept his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) employment. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was a painter of
engines, a first-rate hand, earning good money, from twenty-five to thirty
shillings a week. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was a proud man, but so avaricious that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stopped at
nothing to get money. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was an ardent politician, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would sell his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
vote to the highest bidder, and when Esther was seventeen he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) compelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
to take service regardless of the character of the people or of what the
place was like. They had left Barnstaple many months, and were now living
in a little street off the Vauxhall Bridge Road, near the factory where
Saunders worked; and since they had been in London Esther had been
constantly in service. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wasn't one of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
children, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had quite enough of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own. Sometimes of an evening, when
Esther could escape from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) drudgery for a few minutes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mother would
step round, and mother and daughter, wrapped in the same shawl, would walk
to and fro telling each other their troubles, just as in old times. But
these moments were few. In grimy lodging-houses she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) worked from early
morning till late at night, scrubbing grates, preparing bacon and eggs,
cooking chops, and making beds. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had become one of those London girls
to whom rest, not to say pleasure, is unknown, who if they should sit down
for a few moments hear the mistress's voice, <div class="bookquote">``Now, Eliza, have you nothing
to do, that you are sitting there idle?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mistress</b></font>)</div>Two of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) mistresses, one after
the other, had been sold up, and now all the rooms in the neighbourhood
were unlet, no one wanted a <div class="bookquote">``slavey,''  (<font color='red'><b>mistresses</b></font>)</div>and Esther was obliged to return
home. It was on the last of these occasions that her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) father had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
by the shoulders, saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No lodging-houses that want a slavey? I'll see about that. Tell me,
first, have you been to 78?''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but another girl was before me, and the place was taken when I
arrived.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder what you were doing that you didn't get there sooner; dangling
about after your mother, I suppose! Well, what about 27 in the Crescent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't go there--that Mrs. Dunbar is a bad woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bad woman! Who are you, I should like to know, that you can take a lady's
character away? Who told you she (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was a bad woman? One of the
Scripture-readers, I suppose! I knew it was. Well, then, just get out of
my house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where shall I go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to hell for all I care. Do you hear me? Get out!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther did not move--words, and then blows. Esther's escape from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
stepfather seemed a miracle, and his (<font color='blue'><b>stepfather</b></font>) anger was only appeased by Mrs.
Saunders promising that Esther should accept the situation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only for a little while. Perhaps Mrs. Dunbar is a better woman than you
think for. For my sake, dearie. If you don't he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) may kill you and me too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) one moment, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Very well, mother,
to-morrow I'll take the place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>No longer was the girl starved, no longer was she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) made to drudge till the
thought of another day was a despair and a terror. And seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
a good girl, Mrs. Dunbar respected her (<font color='blue'><b>Dunbar</b></font>) scruples. Indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dunbar</b></font>) was very
kind, and Esther soon learnt to like her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and, through her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) affection for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), to think less of the life she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) led. A dangerous point is this in a
young girl's life. Esther was young, and pretty, and weary, and out of
health; and it was at this critical moment that Lady Elwin, who, while
visiting, had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Elwin</b></font>) story, promised Mrs. Saunders to find Esther
another place. And to obviate all difficulties about references and
character, Lady Elwin proposed to take Esther as her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) own servant for a
sufficient while to justify her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) in recommending her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).

<p/>And now, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) turned over her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) books--the books she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not read--her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
pure and passionate mind was filled with the story of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) poor little brothers and sisters and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) dear mother, and
that tyrant revenging himself upon them because of the little she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) might
eat and drink. No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) must bear with all insults and scorn, and forget
that they thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) as dirt under their feet. But what were such
sufferings compared to those she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would endure were she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to return home? In
truth they were as nothing. And yet the girl longed to leave Woodview. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
had never been out of sight of home before. Amid the violences of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
stepfather there had always been her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother and the meeting-house. In
Woodview there was nothing, only Margaret, who had come to console and
persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to come downstairs. The resolution she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had to call out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
soul to do this exhausted her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) went downstairs heedless of what
anyone might say.

<p/>Two and three days passed without anything occurring that might suggest
that the Fates were for or against her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) remaining. Mrs. Barfield continued
to be indisposed, but at the end of the week Esther, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was at work
in the scullery, heard a new voice speaking with Mrs. Latch. This must be
Mrs. Barfield. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) heard Mrs. Latch tell the story of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) refusal to go to
work the evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) arrived. But Mrs. Barfield told her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) would
listen to no further complaints; this was the third kitchen-maid in four
months, and Mrs. Latch must make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) mind to bear with the faults and
failings of this last one, whatever they were. Then Mrs. Barfield called
Esther; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) entered the kitchen she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) found herself face to face
with a little red-haired woman, with a pretty, pointed face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hear, Waters--that is your name, I think--that you refused to obey
cook, and walked out of the kitchen the night you arrived.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said, ma'am, that I would wait till my box came up from the station, so
that I might change my dress. Mrs. Latch said my dress didn't matter, but
when one is poor and hasn't many dresses--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you short of clothes, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not many, ma'am, and the dress I had on the day I came--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind about that. Tell me, are you short of clothes?--for if you are
I daresay my daughter might find you something--you are about the same
height--with a little alteration--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, ma'am, you are too good. I shall be most grateful. But I think I
shall be able to manage till my first quarter's wages come to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>And the scowl upon Mrs. Latch's long face did not kill the pleasure which
the little interview with that kind, sweet woman, Mrs. Barfield, had
created in her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) moved about her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) work, happy at heart, singing to
herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) washed the vegetables. Even Mrs. Latch's harshness didn't
trouble her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) much. She (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) felt it to be a manner under which there might be a
kind heart, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) hoped by her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) willingness to work to gain at least the
cook's toleration. Margaret suggested that Esther should give up her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) beer.
A solid pint extra a day could not fail, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, to win the old woman's
gratitude, and perhaps induce her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to teach Esther how to make pastry and
jellies.

<p/>True that Margaret joined in the common laugh and jeer that the knowledge
that Esther said her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) prayers morning and evening inspired. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sometimes
united with Grover and Sarah in perplexing Esther with questions regarding
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) previous situations, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hostilities were, on the whole, gentle,
and Esther felt that this almost neutral position was the best that
Margaret could have adopted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) defended her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) without seeming to do so,
and seemed genuinely fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), helping her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sometimes even with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
work, which Mrs. Latch made as heavy as possible. But Esther was now
determined to put up with every task they might impose upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would
give them no excuse for sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) away; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would remain at Woodview
until she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had learned sufficient cooking to enable her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to get another
place. But Mrs. Latch had the power to thwart her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) in this. Before
beginning on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) jellies and gravies Mrs. Latch was sure to find some
saucepans that had not been sufficiently cleaned with white sand, and, if
her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) search proved abortive, she (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) would send Esther upstairs to scrub out
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) bedroom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot think why she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is so down upon me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther often said to
Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) isn't more down upon you than she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was on the others. You needn't
expect to learn any cooking from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) plan has always been to take
care that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) shall not be supplanted by any of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) kitchen-maids. But I
don't see why she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) should be always sending you upstairs to clean out her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
bedroom. If Grover wasn't so stand-offish, we might tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) about it, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) could tell the Saint--that's what we call the missis; the Saint would
soon put a stop to all that nonsense. I will say that for the Saint, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)
do like everyone to have fair play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barfield/Barfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Barfield, or the Saint, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was called, belonged, like Esther, to
the sect known as the Plymouth Brethren. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was the daughter of one of
the farmers on the estate--a very old man called Elliot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
life on his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) barren down farm, becoming intimate with no one, driving hard
bargains with all, especially the squire and the poor flint-pickers. He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>)
could be seen still on the hill-sides, his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) long black coat buttoned
strictly about him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) soft felt hat crushed over the thin, grey face.
Pretty Fanny Elliot had won the squire's heart as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) rode across the down.
Do you not see the shy figure of the Puritan maiden tripping through the
gorse, hastening the hoofs of the squire's cob? And, furnished with some
pretext of estate business, he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) often rode to the farm that lay under the
shaws at the end of the coombe. The squire had to promise to become one of
the Brethren and he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) had to promise never to bet again, before Fanny Elliot
agreed to become Mrs. Barfield. The ambitious members of the Barfield
family declared that the marriage was social ruin, but more dispassionate
critics called it a very suitable match; for it was not forgotten that
three generations ago the Barfields were livery-stable keepers; they had
risen in the late squire's time to the level of county families, and the
envious were now saying that the Barfield family was sinking back whence
it came.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) was faithful to his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) promises for a time. Race-horses disappeared from
the Woodview stables. It was not until after the birth of both his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>)
children that he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) entered one of his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) hunters in the hunt steeplechase. Soon
after the racing stable was again in full swing at Woodview. Tears there
were, and some family disunion, but time extorts concessions from all of
us. Mrs. Barfield had ceased to quarrel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) husband on the subject of
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) racehorses, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) turn did not attempt to restrict her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) in the
exercise of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) religion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) attended prayer-meetings when her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) soul moved
her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>), and read the Scriptures when and where she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) pleased.

<p/>It was one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) practices to have the women-servants for half-an-hour
every Sunday afternoon in the library, and instruct them in the life of
Christ. Mrs. Barfield's goodness was even as a light upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) little oval
face--reddish hair growing thin at the parting and smoothed back above the
ears, as in an old engraving. Although nearly fifty, her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) figure was slight
as a young girl's. Esther was attracted by the magnetism of racial and
religious affinities; and when their eyes met at prayers there was
acknowledgment of religious kinship. A glow of happiness filled Esther's
soul, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was no longer wholly among strangers; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knew they
were united--she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mistress--under the sweet dominion of Christ. To
look at Mrs. Barfield filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>), somehow, with recollections of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) pious
childhood; she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) saw herself in the old shop, moving again in an atmosphere
of prayer, listening to the beautiful story, in the annunciation of which
her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) life had grown up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) mistress's questions in sweet
light-heartedness of spirit, pleasing her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) knowledge of the Holy
Book. But in turn the servants had begun to read verses aloud from the New
Testament, and Esther saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) secret would be torn from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). Sarah
had read a verse, and Mrs. Barfield had explained it, and now Margaret was
reading. Esther listened, thinking if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) might plead illness and escape
from the room; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not summon sufficient presence of mind, and
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was still agitated and debating with herself, Mrs. Barfield
called to her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) to continue. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) hung down her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) head, suffocated with the
shame of the exposure, and when Mrs. Barfield told her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) again to continue
the reading Esther shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you not read, Esther?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heard a kind voice saying; and the sound
of this voice loosed the feelings long pent up, and the girl, giving way
utterly, burst into passionate weeping. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) suffering,
conscious of nothing else, until a kind hand led her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) from the room, and
this hand soothed away the bitterness of the tittering which reached her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
ears as the door closed. It was hard to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to speak, but even
the first words showed that there was more on the girl's heart than could
be told in a few minutes. Mrs. Barfield determined to take the matter at
once in hand; she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) dismissed the other servants and returned to the library
with Esther, and in that dim room of little green sofas, bookless shelves,
and bird-cages, the women--mistress and maid--sealed the bond of a
friendship which was to last for life.

<p/>Esther told her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mistress everything--the work that Mrs. Latch required of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>), the persecution she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) received from the other servants, principally
because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) religion. In the course of the narrative allusion was made
to the race-horses, and Esther saw on Mrs. Barfield's face a look of
grief, and it was clear to what cause Mrs. Barfield attributed the
demoralisation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) household.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will teach you how to read, Esther. Every Sunday after our Bible
instruction you shall remain when the others have left for half-an-hour.
It is not difficult; you will soon learn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barfield/Barfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Henceforth, every Sunday afternoon, Mrs. Barfield devoted half-an-hour to
the instruction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) kitchen-maid. These half-hours were bright spots of
happiness in the serving-girl's weeks of work--happiness that had been and
would be again. But although possessing a clear intelligence, Esther did
not make much progress, nor did her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) diligence seem to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). Mrs.
Barfield was puzzled by her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) pupil's slowness; she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) ascribed it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) own
inaptitude to teach and the little time for lessons. Esther's
powerlessness to put syllables together, to grasp the meaning of words,
was very marked. Strange it was, no doubt, but all that concerned the
printed page seemed to embarrass and elude her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).




<p/>IV


<p/>Esther's position in Woodview was now assured, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) fellow-servants
recognised the fact, though they liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) none the better for it. Mrs.
Latch still did what she (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) could to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) from learning her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) trade, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) no longer attempted to overburden her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) with work. Of Mr. Leopold she (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>)
saw almost as little as she (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) did of the people upstairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) passed along
the passages or remained shut up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) pantry. Ginger used to go there to
smoke; and when the door stood ajar Esther saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) narrow person seated on
the edge of the table, his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) leg swinging. Among the pantry people Mr.
Leopold's erudition was a constant subject of admiration. His (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>)
reminiscences of the races of thirty years ago were full of interest; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>)
had seen the great horses whose names live in the stud-book, the horses
the Gaffer had owned, had trained, had ridden, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) was full of anecdote
concerning them and the Gaffer. Praise of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) father's horsemanship always
caused a cloud to gather on Ginger's face, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) left the pantry
Swindles chuckled. ``Whenever I wants to get a rise out of Ginger I says,
<div class="bookquote">``Ah, we shall never see another gentleman jock who can use the whip at a
finish like the Governor in his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) best days.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Everyone</b></font>)</div><p/>Everyone delighted in the pantry, and to make Mr. Leopold comfortable Mr.
Swindles used to bring in the wolf-skin rug that went out with the
carriage, and wrap it round Mr. Leopold's wooden armchair, and the sallow
little man would curl himself up, and, smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) long clay, discuss the
weights of the next big handicap. If Ginger contradicted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would go
to the press and extract from its obscurity a package of _Bell's Life_ or
a file of the _Sportsman_.

<p/>Mr. Leopold's press! For forty years no one had looked into that press.
Mr. Leopold guarded it from every gaze, but it seemed to be a much-varied
repository from which, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) chose, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) could produce almost any trifle
that might be required. It seemed to combine the usefulness of a hardware
shop and a drug store.

<p/>The pantry had its etiquette and its discipline. Jockey boys were rarely
admitted, unless with the intention of securing their services for the
cleaning of boots or knives. William was very proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) right of entry.
For that half-hour in the pantry he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would willingly surrender the pleasure
of walking in the drove-way with Sarah. But when Mrs. Latch learnt that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
was there her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) face darkened, and the noise she (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) then made about the range
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) saucepans was alarming. Mrs. Barfield shared her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) cook's horror of
the pantry, and often spoke of Mr. Leopold as <div class="bookquote">``that little man.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leopold</b></font>)</div>Although
outwardly the family butler, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) had never ceased to be the Gaffer's
private servant; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) represented the old days of bachelorhood. Mrs.
Barfield and Mrs. Latch both disliked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>). Had it not been for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>)
influence Mrs. Barfield felt sure her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) husband would never have returned to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) vice. Had it not been for Mr. Leopold Mrs. Latch felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) husband
would never have taken to betting. Legends and mystery had formed around
Mr. Leopold and his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) pantry, and in Esther's unsophisticated mind this
little room, with its tobacco smoke and glasses on the table, became a
symbol of all that was wicked and dangerous; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) passed the door
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) ears to the loud talk and instinctively lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>The simplest human sentiments were abiding principles in Esther--love of
God, and love of God in the home. But above this Protestantism was human
nature; and at this time Esther was, above all else, a young girl. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
twentieth year thrilled within her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was no longer weary with work, and
new, rich blood filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) veins. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sang at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) work, gladdened by the
sights and sounds of the yard; the young rooks cawing lustily in the
evergreens, the gardener passing to and fro with plants in his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) hands, the
white cats licking themselves in the sun or running to meet the young
ladies who brought them plates of milk. Then the race-horses were always
going to or coming from the downs. Sometimes they came in so covered with
white mud that part of their toilette was accomplished in the yard; and
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) kitchen window she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could see the beautiful creature haltered to
the hook fixed in the high wall, and the little boy in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shirtsleeves
and hitched-up trousers, not a bit afraid, but shouting and quieting him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
into submission with the stick when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) kicked and bit, tickled by the
washing brush passing under the belly. Then the wrestling, sparring,
ball-playing of the lads when their work was done, the pale, pathetic
figure of the Demon watching them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) was about to start for Portslade and
back, wrapped, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) would put it, in a red-hot scorcher of an overcoat.

<p/>Esther often longed for a romp with these boys; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was now prime
favourite with them. Once they caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) in the hay yard, and fine sport
it was in the warm hay throwing each other over. Sometimes her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wayward
temper would get the better of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), but her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) momentary rage vanished at the
sound of laughter. And after their tussling they would walk a little while
pensively, until perhaps one, with an adroit trip, would send the other
rolling over on the grass, and then, with wild cries, they would run down
the drove-way. Then there was the day when the Wool-gatherer told her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
was in love, and what fun they had had, and how well she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had led him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) into
belief that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was jealous! She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had taken a rope as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) were going to
hang herself, and having fastened it to a branch, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had knelt down as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) were saying her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) prayers. The poor Wool-gatherer could stand it no
longer; he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had rushed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) side, swearing that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would promise not
to hang herself he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) would never look at another girl again. The other boys,
who had been crouching in the drove-way, rose up. How they did chaff the
Wool-gatherer! He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had burst into tears and Esther had felt sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>),
and almost inclined to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) out of pity for his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) forlorn condition.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) life grew happier and happier. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) forgot that Mrs. Latch would not
teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) how to make jellies, and had grown somewhat used to Sarah's
allusions to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) ignorance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was still very poor, had not sufficient
clothes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) life was full of little troubles; but there were
compensations. It was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) that Mrs. Barfield always came when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
wanted anything in a hurry, and Miss Mary, too, seemed to prefer to apply
to Esther when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wanted milk for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) cats or bran and oats for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
rabbits.

<p/>The Gaffer and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) race-horses, the Saint and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) greenhouse--so went the
stream of life at Woodview. What few visitors came were entertained by
Miss Mary in the drawing-room or on the tennis lawn. Mrs. Barfield saw no
one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) desired to remain in her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) old gown--an old thing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) daughter
had discarded long ago--pinned up around her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>), and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) head an old
bonnet with a faded poppy hanging from the crown. In such attire she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>)
wished to be allowed to trot about to and fro from her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) greenhouse to her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>)
potting-shed, watering, pruning, and syringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) plants. These plants
were dearer than all things to her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) except her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) children; she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) seemed,
indeed, to treat them as if they were children, and with the sun pouring
through the glass down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) back she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) would sit freeing them from
devouring insects all the day long. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) would carry can after can of water
up the long path and never complain of fatigue. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) broke into complaint
only when Miss Mary forgot to feed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pets, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had a great
number--rabbits, and cats, and rooks, and all the work devolved upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not see these poor dumb creatures hungry, and would trudge to
the stables, coming back laden with trusses of hay. But it was sometimes
more than a pair of hands could do, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would send Esther with scraps
of meat and bread and milk to the unfortunate rooks that Mary had so
unmercifully forgotten. <div class="bookquote">``I'll have no more pets,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'d say, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Mary
won't look after them, and all the trouble falls upon me. See these poor
cats, how they come mewing round my skirts.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) loved to expatiate on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
inexhaustible affection for dumb animals, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) continued an anecdotal
discourse till, suddenly wearying of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would break off and speak to
Esther about Barnstaple and the Brethren.

<p/>The Saint loved to hear Esther tell of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) father and the little shop in
Barnstaple, of the prayer-meetings and the simple earnestness and
narrowness of the faith of those good Brethren. Circumstances had effaced,
though they had not obliterated, the once sharply-marked confines of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
religious habits. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) religion was like a garden--a little less sedulously
tended than of yore, but no whit less fondly loved; and while listening to
Esther's story she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) dreamed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) own early life over again, and paused,
laying down her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) watering-can, penetrated with the happiness of gentle
memories. So Esther's life grew and was fashioned; so amid the ceaseless
round of simple daily occupations mistress and maid learned to know and to
love one another, and became united and strengthful in the tender and
ineffable sympathies of race and religion.




<p/>V


<p/>The summer drowsed, baking the turf on the hills, and after every gallop
the Gaffer passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) fingers along the fine legs of the crack, in fear
and apprehension lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) should detect any swelling. William came every
day for news. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had five shillings on; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) stood to win five pounds
ten--quite a little fortune--and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) often stopped to ask Esther if there
was any news as he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) way to the pantry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) that so far as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knew Silver Braid was all right, and continued shaking the rug.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll never get the dust out of that rug,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Braid</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``here, give
it to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hesitated, then gave it him (<font color='blue'><b>Braid</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Braid</b></font>) beat it against the
brick wall. <div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Braid</b></font>) said, handing it back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that's how I beats
a mat; you won't find much dust in it now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you... Sarah went by an hour and a half ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) must have gone to the Gardens. You have never been to those
gardens, have you? Dancing-hall, theatre, sorcerers--every blessed thing.
But you're that religious, I suppose you wouldn't come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is only the way you are brought up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, will you come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I should like those Gardens... But I daresay they are no
worse than any other place. I've heard so much since I was here, that
really--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That really what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That sometimes it seems useless like to be particular.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course--all rot. Well, will you come next Sunday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not on Sunday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Gaffer</b></font>)</div><p/>The Gaffer had engaged him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) as footman: his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) livery would be ready by
Saturday, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) would enter service on Monday week. This reminded them
that henceforth they would see each other every day, and, speaking of the
pain it would give his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) mother when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) came running downstairs to go out
with the carriage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was always her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) idea that I shouldn't be a servant, but I believe in
doing what you gets most coin for doing. I should like to have been a
jockey, and I could have ridden well enough--the Gaffer thought better at
one time of my riding than he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) did of Ginger's. But I never had any luck;
when I was about fifteen I began to grow... If I could have remained like
the Demon--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>), wondering if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) were speaking seriously, and really
wished away his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) splendid height and shoulders.

<p/>A few days later he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) tried to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to take a ticket in a shilling
sweepstakes which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) was getting up among the out and the indoor servants.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) pleaded poverty--her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wages would not be due till the end of August.
But William offered to lend her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) the money, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) pressed the hat
containing the bits of paper on which were written the horses' names so
insinuatingly upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) that a sudden impulse to oblige him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>),
and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had time to think she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had put her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hand in the hat and taken
a number.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, none of your betting and gambling in my kitchen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Latch</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Latch,
turning from her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) work. <div class="bookquote">``Why can't you leave that innocent girl alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be that disagreeable, mother; it ain't betting, it's a
sweepstakes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>muttered Mrs. Latch; <div class="bookquote">``it always begins that way, and
it goes on from bad to worse. I never saw any good come from it, and
Heaven knows I've seen enough misfortune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Gale/Gale</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret and Sarah paused, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) open-mouthed, a little
perplexed, holding the numbers they had drawn in both hands. Esther had
not unfolded hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looked at Mrs. Latch and regretted having taken the
ticket in the lottery. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) feared jeers from Sarah, or from Grover, who
had just come in, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) inability to read the name of the horse she (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) had
drawn. Seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) dilemma, William took her (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) paper from her (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Silver Braid... by Jingo! She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has got the right one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the servants</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment the sound of hoofs was heard in the yard, and the servants
flew to the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>)'ll win,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>cried William, leaning over the women's backs, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
bony hand to the Demon, who rode past on Silver Braid. <div class="bookquote">``The Gaffer will
bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) to the post as fit as a fiddle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leopold</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Leopold. <div class="bookquote">``The rain has done us a lot of good;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) was beginning to go a bit short a week ago. We shall want some more
rain. I should like to see it come down for the next week or more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leopold</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Leopold's desires looked as if they were going to be fulfilled. The
heavens seemed to have taken the fortunes of the stable in hand. Rain fell
generally in the afternoon and night, leaving the mornings fine, and
Silver Braid went the mile gaily, becoming harder and stronger. And in the
intermittent swish of showers blown up from the sea Woodview grew joyous,
and a conviction of ultimate triumph gathered and settled on every face
except Mrs. Barfield's and Mrs. Latch's. And askance they looked at the
triumphant little butler. He (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) became more and more the topic of
conversation. He (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) seemed to hold the thread of their destiny in his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) press.
Peggy was especially afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>).

<p/>And, continuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) confidences to the under-housemaid, the young lady
said, <div class="bookquote">``I like to know things for the pleasure of talking about them, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) for the pleasure of holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) tongue.''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>Peggy was Miss Margaret
Barfield, a cousin, the daughter of a rich brewer. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) brings in your
letters in the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) hands them to you just as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) knew whom they
are from. Ugly little beast; it irritates me when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) comes into the room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) hates women, Miss; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) never lets us near his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) pantry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) keeps
William there talking racing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, William is very different. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) ought never to have been a servant. His (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
family was once quite as good as the Barfields.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I have heard, Miss.. But the world is that full of ups and downs you
never can tell who is who. But we all likes William and `ates that little
man and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) pantry. Mrs. Latch calls him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) the `evil genius.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>A man</b></font>)</div><p/>A furtive and clandestine little man, ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) women-folk and
keeping them out of sight as much as possible. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife a pale, dim woman,
tall as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was short, preserving still some of the graces of the
lady's-maid, shy either by nature or by the severe rule of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) lord,
always anxious to obliterate herself against the hedges when you met her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
in the lane or against the pantry door when any of the family knocked to
ask for hot water, or came with a letter for the post. By nature a
bachelor, he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) was instinctively ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) family, and when the
weary-looking wife, the thin, shy girl, or the corpulent, stupid-faced son
were with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) heard steps outside, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would come out like a little
wasp, and, unmistakably resenting the intrusion, would ask what was
wanted.

<p/>If it were Ginger, Mr. Leopold would say, <div class="bookquote">``Can I do anything for you, Mr.
Arthur?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leopold</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing, thank you; I only thought that--''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginger</b></font>)</div>and Ginger would invent
some paltry excuse and slink away to smoke elsewhere.

<p/>Every day, a little before twelve, Mr. Leopold went out for his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) morning
walk; every day if it were fine you would meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) at that hour in the
lane either coming from or going to Shoreham. For thirty years he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) had done
his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) little constitutional, always taking the same road, always starting
within a few minutes of twelve, always returning in time to lay the cloth
for lunch at half-past one. The hour between twelve and one he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) spent in
the little cottage which he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) rented from the squire for his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) wife and
children, or in the <div class="bookquote">``Red Lion,''  (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div>where he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) had a glass of beer and talked
with Watkins, the bookmaker.

<p/>``There he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) goes, off to the ``Red Lion,''' said Mrs. Latch. <div class="bookquote">``They try to get
some information out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)'s too sharp for them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knows it;
that's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) goes there for--just for the pleasure of seeing them
swallow the lies he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) tells them... He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) has been telling them lies about the
horses for the last twenty years, and still he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) get them to believe what he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
says. It is a cruel shame! It was the lies he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) told poor Jackson about Blue
Beard that made the poor man back the horse for all he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was worth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the horse didn't win?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Win! The master didn't even intend to run him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), and Jackson lost all he (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>)
had, and more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) went down to the river and drowned himself. John Randal
has that man's death on his (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) conscience. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) conscience don't trouble
him (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) much; if it did he (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>)'d be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) grave long ago. Lies, lies, nothing but
lies! But I daresay I'm too `ard on him (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>); isn't lies our natural lot? What
is servants for but to lie when it is in their master's interest, and to
be a confidential servant is to be the Prince of liars!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) didn't know the `orse was scratched.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see you are falling in nicely with the lingo of the trade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>replied Esther, laughing; <div class="bookquote">``one never hears anything else; one picks
it up without knowing. Mr. Leopold is very rich, so they say. The boys
tell me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) won a pile over the City and Suburban, and has thousands
in the bank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So some says; but who knows what he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) has? One hears of the winnings, but
they say very little about the losings.''




 (<font color='red'><b>VI The boys</b></font>)</div><p/>VI


<p/>The boys were playing ball in the stables, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not feel as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
wanted to romp with them. There was a stillness and a sweetness abroad
which penetrated and absorbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) moved towards the paddock gate; the
pony and the donkey came towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) rubbed their muzzles in
turn. It was a pleasure to touch anything, especially anything alive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
even noticed that the elm trees were strangely tall and still against the
calm sky, and the rich odour of some carnations which came through the
bushes from the pleasure-ground excited her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>); the scent of earth and leaves
tingled in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and the cawing of the rooks coming home took her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) soul away
skyward in an exquisite longing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was, at the same time, full of
romantic love for the earth, and of a desire to mix herself with the
innermost essence of things. The beauty of the evening and the sea breeze
instilled a sensation of immortal health, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wondered if a young man
came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) as young men came to the great ladies in Sarah's books, how it
would be to talk in the dusk, seeing the bats flitting and the moon rising
through the branches.

<p/>The family was absent from Woodview, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was free to enjoy the beauty
of every twilight and every rising moon for still another week. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
wearied for a companion. Sarah and Grover were far too grand to walk out
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>); and Margaret had a young man who came to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and in their
room at night she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) related all he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had said. But for Esther there was
nothing to do all the long summer evenings but to sit at the kitchen
window sewing. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hands fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) lap, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heart heaved a sigh of
weariness. In all this world there was nothing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to do but to
continue her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sewing or to go for a walk on the hill. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was tired of that
weary hill! But she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not sit in the kitchen till bedtime. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) might
meet the old shepherd coming home with his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) sheep, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) put a piece of
bread in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) pocket for his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) dogs and strolled up the hill-side. Margaret
had gone down to the Gardens. One of these days a young man would come to
take her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) out. What would he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be like? She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) laughed the thought away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did
not think that any young man would bother much about her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). Happening at
that moment to look round, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) saw a man coming through the hunting gate.
His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) height and shoulders told her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was William. <div class="bookquote">``Trying to find
Sarah,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``I must not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) think I am waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) walk, wondering if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were following, afraid to look round.
At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could hear footsteps; her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) heart beat faster. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
called to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think Sarah has gone to the Gardens,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said, turning round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You always keep reminding me of Sarah. There's nothing between us;
anything there ever was is all off long ago... Are you going for a walk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was glad of the chance to get a mouthful of fresh air, and they went
towards the hunting gate. William held it open and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) passed through.

<p/>The plantations were enclosed by a wooden fence, and beyond them the bare
downs rose hill after hill. On the left the land sloped into a shallow
valley sown with various crops; and the shaws about Elliot's farm were the
last trees. Beyond the farmhouse the downs ascended higher and higher,
treeless, irreclaimable, scooped into long patriarchal solitudes, thrown
into wild crests.

<p/>There was a smell of sheep in the air, and the flock trotted past them in
good order, followed by the shepherd, a huge hat and a crook in his (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) hand,
and two shaggy dogs at his (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) heels. A brace of partridges rose out of the
sainfoin, and flew down the hills; and watching their curving flight
Esther and William saw the sea under the sun-setting, and the string of
coast towns.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A lovely evening, isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther acquiesced; and tempted by the warmth of the grass they sat down,
and the mystery of the twilight found way into their consciousness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shan't have any rain yet awhile.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>William answered, eager to show his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) superior knowledge.
<div class="bookquote">``Look due south-west, straight through that last dip in that line of
hills. Do you see anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I can see nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther, after straining her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes for a few
moments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought not... Well, if it was going to rain you would see the Isle of
Wight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>For something to say, and hoping to please, Esther asked him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) where the
race-course was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, over yonder. I can't show you the start, a long way behind that
hill, Portslade way; then they come right along by that gorse and finish
up by Truly barn--you can't see Truly barn from here, that's Thunder's
barrow barn; they go quite half a mile farther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And does all that land belong to the Gaffer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and a great deal more, too; but this down land isn't worth much--not
more than about ten shillings an acre.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how many acres are there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean all that we can see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Gaffer's property reaches to Southwick Hill, and it goes north a long
way. I suppose you don't know that all this piece, all that lies between
us and that barn yonder, once belonged to my family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To your family?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, the Latches were once big swells; in the time of my
great-grandfather the Barfields could not hold their heads as high as the
Latches. My great-grandfather had a pot of money, but it all went.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Racing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A good bit, I've no doubt. A rare `ard liver, cock-fighting, `unting,
`orse-racing from one year's end to the other. Then after `im came my
grandfather; he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) went to the law, and a sad mess he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) made of it--went
stony-broke and left my father without a sixpence; that is why mother
didn't want me to go into livery. The family `ad been coming down for
generations, and mother thought that I was born to restore it; and so I
was, but not as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought, by carrying parcels up and down the King's
Road.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther looked at William in silent admiration, and, feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had
secured an appreciative listener, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) continued his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) monologue regarding the
wealth and rank his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) family had formerly held, till a heavy dew forced them
to their feet. In front of them was the moon, and out of the forlorn sky
looked down the misted valleys; the crests of the hills were still touched
with light, and lights flew from coast town to coast town, weaving a
luminous garland.

<p/>The sheep had been folded, and seeing them lying in the greyness of this
hill-side, and beyond them the massive moonlit landscape and the vague
sea, Esther suddenly became aware, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had never done before, of the
exceeding beauty of the world. Looking up in William's face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how beautiful!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As they descended the drove-way their feet raised the chalk, and William
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is bad for Silver Braid; we shall want some more rain in a day or
two... Let's come for a walk round the farm,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``The farm
belongs to the Gaffer, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>)'s let the Lodge to a young fellow called
Johnson. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>)'s the chap that Peggy used to go after--there was awful rows
about that, and worse when he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) forestalled the Gaffer about Egmont.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The conversation wandered agreeably, and they became more conscious of
each other. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) all he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) knew about the chap who had jilted Miss
Mary, and the various burlesque actresses at the Shoreham Gardens who had
captivated Ginger's susceptible heart. While listening she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginger</b></font>) suddenly became
aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginger</b></font>) had never been so happy before. Now all she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginger</b></font>) had endured
seemed accidental; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginger</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginger</b></font>) had entered into the permanent; and
in the midst of vague but intense sensations William showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginger</b></font>) the
pigeon-house with all the blue birds dozing on the tiles, a white one here
and there. They visited the workshop, the forge, and the old cottages
where the bailiff and the shepherd lived; and all this inanimate
nature--the most insignificant objects--seemed inspired, seemed like
symbols of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginger</b></font>) emotion.

<p/>They left the farm and wandered on the high road until a stile leading to
a cornfield beguiled and then delayed their steps.

<p/>The silence of the moonlight was clear and immense; and they listened to
the trilling of the nightingale in the copse hard by. First they sought to
discover the brown bird in the branches of the poor hedge, and then the
reason of the extraordinary emotion in their hearts. It seemed that all
life was beating in that moment, and they were as it were inflamed to
reach out their hands to life and to grasp it together. Even William
noticed that. And the moon shone on the mist that had gathered on the long
marsh lands of the foreshore. Beyond the trees the land wavered out into
down land, the river gleamed and intensely.

<p/>This moment was all the poetry of their lives. The striking of a match to
light his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) pipe, which had gone out, put the music to flight, and all along
the white road he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) continued his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) monologue, interrupted only by the
necessity of puffing at his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) pipe.

<p/>``Mother says that if I had twopence worth of pride in me I wouldn't have
consented to put on the livery; but what I says to mother is, ``What's the
use of having pride if you haven't money?'' I tells her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) that I am rotten
with pride, but my pride is to make money. I can't see that the man what
is willing to remain poor all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life has any pride at all... But, Lord!
I have argued with mother till I'm sick; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can see nothing further than
the livery; that's what women are--they are that short-sighted... A lot
of good it would have done me to have carried parcels all my life, and
when I could do four mile an hour no more, to be turned out to die in the
ditch and be buried by the parish. ``Not good enough,'' says I. ``If that's
your pride, mother, you may put it in your pipe and smoke it, and as you
`aven't got a pipe, perhaps behind the oven will do as well,<div class="bookquote">''--that's what
I said to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). I saw well enough there was nothing for me but service, and
I means to stop here until I can get on three or four good things and then
retire into a nice comfortable public-house and do my own betting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I. pride mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would give up betting then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I'd give up backing `orses, if you mean that... What I should like would
be to get on to a dozen good things at long prices--half-a-dozen like
Silver Braid would do it. For a thousand or fifteen hundred pounds I could
have the ``Red Lion,<div class="bookquote">'' and just inside my own bar I could do a hundred-pound
book on all the big races.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Red Lion</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther listened, hearing interminable references to jockeys, publicans,
weights, odds, and the certainty, if he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had the <div class="bookquote">``Red Lion,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of being able
to get all Joe Walker's betting business away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>). Allusions to the
police, and the care that must be taken not to bet with anyone who had not
been properly introduced, frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>); but her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) fears died in the
sensation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) arm about her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) waist, and the music that the striking of a
match had put to flight had begun again in the next plantation, and it
began again in their hearts. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) were going to marry Sarah! The idea
amused him (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) laughed loudly, and they walked up the avenue, his (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) face
bent over hers.




<p/>VII


<p/>The Barfield calculation was that they had a stone in hand. Bayleaf, Mr.
Leopold argued, would be backed to win a million of money if he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) were
handicapped in the race at seven stone; and Silver Braid, who had been
tried again with Bayleaf, and with the same result as before, had been let
off with only six stone.

<p/>More rain had fallen, the hay-crop had been irretrievably ruined, the
prospects of the wheat harvest were jeopardized, but what did a few
bushels of wheat matter? Another pound of muscle in those superb
hind-quarters was worth all the corn that could be grown between here and
Henfield. Let the rain come down, let every ear of wheat be destroyed, so
long as those delicate fore-legs remained sound. These were the ethics
that obtained at Woodview, and within the last few days showed signs of
adoption by the little town and not a few of the farmers, grown tired of
seeing their crops rotting on the hill-sides. The fever of the gamble was
in eruption, breaking out in unexpected places--the station-master, the
porters, the flymen, all had their bit on, and notwithstanding the
enormous favouritism of two other horses in the race--Prisoner and Stoke
Newington--Silver Braid had advanced considerably in the betting. Reports
of trials won had reached Brighton, and not more than five-and-twenty to
one could now be obtained.

<p/>The discovery that the Demon had gone up several pounds in weight had
introduced the necessary alloy into the mintage of their happiness; the
most real consternation prevailed, and the strictest investigation was
made as to when and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) had obtained the quantities of food required to
produce such a mass of adipose tissue. Then the Gaffer had the boy
upstairs and administered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) a huge dose of salts, seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) swallow
every drop; and when the effects of the medicine had worn off he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) was sent
for a walk to Portslade in two large overcoats, and was accompanied by
William, whose long legs led the way so effectively. On his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) return a
couple of nice feather beds were ready, and Mr. Leopold and Mr. Swindles
themselves laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Swindles</b></font>) between them, and when they noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Swindles</b></font>) was
beginning to cease to perspire Mr. Leopold made him (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) a nice cup of hot tea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the way the Gaffer used to get the flesh off in the old days when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) rode the winner at Liverpool.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the Demon's own fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Swindles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Swindles; <div class="bookquote">``if he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) hadn't been so
greedy he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) wouldn't have had to sweat, and we should `ave been spared a
deal of bother and anxiety.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Swindles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Greedy!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>murmured the little boy, in whom the warm tea had induced a new
perspiration; <div class="bookquote">``I haven't had what you might call a dinner for the last
three months. I think I'll chuck the whole thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not until this race is over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Swindles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Swindles. <div class="bookquote">``Supposing I was to pass
the warming-pan down these `ere sheets. What do you say, Mr. Leopold? They
are beginning to feel a bit cold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cold! I `ope you'll never go to a `otter place. For God's sake, Mr.
Leopold, don't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) come near me with the warming-pan, or else he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>)'ll
melt the little flesh that's left off me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You `ad better not make such a fuss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leopold</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Leopold; <div class="bookquote">``if you don't do
what you are told, you'll have to take salts again and go for another walk
with William.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leopold</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If we don't warm up them sheets `e'll dry up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Swindles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Swindles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I won't; I'm teeming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be a good boy, and you shall have a nice cut of mutton when you get up,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leopold</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Leopold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much? Two slices?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you see, we can't promise; it all depends on how much has come off,
and `aving once got it hoff, we don't want to put it on again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never did `ear such rot,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Swindles. <div class="bookquote">``In my time a boy's feelings
weren't considered--one did what one considered good for them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leopold</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Leopold strove to engage the Demon's attention with compliments
regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) horsemanship in the City and Sub. while Mr. Swindles raised
the bedclothes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Swindles, you are burning me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For `eaven's sake don't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Swindles</b></font>) start out from under the bed like that!
Can't yer `old him (<font color='blue'><b>Swindles</b></font>)? Burning you! I never even touched you with it; it was
the sheet that you felt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then the sheet is at `ot as the bloody fire. Will yer leave off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! a Demon like you afraid of a little touch of `eat; wouldn't `ave
believed it unless I `ad `eard it with my own ears,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leopold</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Leopold.
<div class="bookquote">``Come, now, do yer want to ride the crack at Goodwood or do yer not? If
you do, remain quiet, and let us finish taking off the last couple of
pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the last couple of pounds that takes it out of one; the first lot
comes off jest like butter,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy, rolling out of the way of the
pan. <div class="bookquote">``I know what it will be; I shall be so weak that I shall just ride a
stinking bad race.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leopold</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Leopold and Mr. Swindles exchanged glances. It was clear they thought
that there was something in the last words of the fainting Demon, and the
pan was withdrawn. But when the boy was got into the scale again it was
found that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was not yet nearly the right weight, and the Gaffer ordered
another effort to be made. The Demon pleaded that his (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) feet were sore, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) was sent off to Portslade in charge of the redoubtable William.

<p/>And as the last pounds came off the Demon's little carcass Mr. Leopold's
face resumed a more tranquil expression. It began to be whispered that
instead of hedging any part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) money he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) would stand it all out, and
one day a market gardener brought up word that he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) had seen Mr. Leopold
going into Brighton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Old Watkins isn't good enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Watkins</b></font>), that's about it. If Silver Braid
wins, Woodview will see very little more of Mr. Leopold. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>)'ll be for
buying one of them big houses on the sea road and keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) own trap.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Gaffer</b></font>)</div><p/>VIII


<p/>The great day was now fast approaching, and the Gaffer had promised to
drive his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) folk in a drag to Goodwood. No more rain was required, the
colt's legs remained sound, and three days of sunshine would make all the
difference in their sum of happiness. In the kitchen Mrs. Latch and Esther
had been busy for some time with chickens and pies and jellies, and in the
passage there were cases packed with fruit and wine. The dressmaker had
come from Worthing, and for several days the young ladies had not left
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). And one fine morning, very early--about eight o'clock--the wheelers
were backed into the drag that had come from Brighton, and the yard
resounded with the blaring of the horn. Ginger was practising under his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
sister's window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll be late! You'll be late!''

 (<font color='red'><b>gentlemen</b></font>)</div><p/>With the exception of two young gentlemen, who had come at the invitation
of the young ladies, it was quite a family party. Miss Mary sat beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
father on the box, and looked very charming in white and blue. Peggy's
black hair seemed blacker than ever under a white silk parasol, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>)
waved negligently above her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) stood up calling and talking to
everyone until the Gaffer told her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) angrily to sit down, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) was going to
start. Then William and the coachman let go the leaders' heads, and
running side by side swung themselves into their seats. At the same moment
a glimpse was caught of Mr. Leopold's sallow profile amid the boxes and
the mackintoshes that filled the inside of the coach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, William did look that handsome in those beautiful new clothes!
...Everyone said so--Sarah and Margaret and Miss Grover. I'm sorry you did
not come out to see him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Latch made no answer, and Esther remembered how she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) son to
wear livery, and thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had perhaps made a mistake in saying
that Mrs. Latch should have come out to see him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps this will make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) dislike me again,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>thought the girl. Mrs. Latch moved about rapidly,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) opened and closed the oven; then, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) eyes to the window
and seeing that the other women were still standing in the yard and safely
out of hearing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) has bet much on this race?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how should I know, Mrs. Latch?... But the horse is certain to win.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certain to win! I have heard that tale before; they are always certain to
win. So they have won you round to their way of thinking, have they?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Latch</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Latch, straightening her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know very well indeed that it is not right to bet; but what can I do, a
poor girl like me? If it hadn't been for William I never would have taken
a number in that sweepstakes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you like him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) very much, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) has been very kind to me--he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was kind when--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know, when I was unkind. I was unkind to you when you first came.
You don't know all. I was much troubled at that time, and somehow I did
not--. But there is no ill-feeling?... I'll make it up to you--I'll teach
you how to be a cook.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mrs. Latch, I am sure--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind that. When you went out to walk with him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) the other night, did
he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) tell you that he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) had many bets on the race?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) talked about the race, like everyone else, but he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) did not tell me what
bets he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) had on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, they never do do that... But you'll not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) that I asked you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Mrs. Latch, I promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would do no good, he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>)'d only be angry; it would only set him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) against
me. I am afraid that nothing will stop him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) now. Once they get a taste for
it it is like drink. I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) was married, that might get him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) out of it.
Some woman who would have an influence over him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>), some strong-minded woman.
I thought once that you were strong-minded--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment Sarah and Grover entered the kitchen talking loudly. They
asked Mrs. Latch how soon they could have dinner--the sooner the better,
for the Saint had told them that they were free to go out for the day.
They were to try to be back before eight, that was all. Ah! the Saint was
a first-rate sort. She (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) had said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) did not want anyone to attend on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) would, get herself a bit of lunch in the dining-room. Mrs. Latch
allowed Esther to hurry on the dinner, and by one o'clock they had all
finished. Sarah and Margaret were going into Brighton to do some shopping,
Grover was going to Worthing to spend the afternoon with the wife of one
of the guards of the Brighton and South Coast Railway. Mrs. Latch went
upstairs to lie down. So it grew lonelier and lonelier in the kitchen.
Esther's sewing fell out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hands, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wondered what she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) should
do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) might go down to the beach, and soon after she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hat and stood thinking, remembering that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had not been by
the sea, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had not seen the sea since she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was a little girl. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) remembered the tall ships that came into the harbour, sail falling
over sail, and the tall ships that floated out of the harbour, sail rising
over sail, catching the breeze as they went aloft--she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) remembered them.

<p/>A suspension bridge, ornamented with straight-tailed lions, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) over
the weedy river, and having crossed some pieces of rough grass, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
climbed the shingle bank. The heat rippled the blue air, and the sea, like
an exhausted caged beast, licked the shingle. Sea-poppies bloomed under
the wheels of a decaying bathing-machine, and Esther wondered. But the sea
here was lonely as a prison, and, seeing the treeless coast with its chain
of towns, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thoughts suddenly reverted to William. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) were
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and for pleasant contemplation she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thought of that happy evening
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) coming through the hunting gate, when, his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) arm about her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>),
William had explained that if the horse won she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would take seven shillings
out of the sweepstakes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knew now that William did not care about
Sarah; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) cared for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had given a sudden and unexpected meaning
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) existence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) lay on the shingle, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) day-dream becoming softer
and more delicate as it rounded into summer sleep.

<p/>And when the light awoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) saw flights of white clouds--white up
above, rose-coloured as they approached the west; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) turned, a
tall, melancholy woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good evening, Mrs. Randal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther, glad to find someone to speak
to. <div class="bookquote">``I've been asleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good evening, Miss.. You're from Woodview, I think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I'm the kitchen-maid. They've gone to the races; there was nothing
to do, so I came down here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Randal</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Randal's lips moved as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) were going to say something. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>)
did not speak. Soon after she (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``I think that it must be
getting near tea-time; I must be going. You might come in and have a cup
of tea with me, if you're not in a hurry back to Woodview.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther was surprised at so much condescension, and in silence the two
women crossed the meadows that lay between the shingle bank and the river.
Trains were passing all the while, scattering, it seemed, in their noisy
passage over the spider-legged bridge, the news from Goodwood. The news
seemed to be borne along shore in the dust, and, as if troubled by
prescience of the news, Mrs. Randal said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) unlocked the cottage
door--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all over now. The people in those trains know well enough which has
won.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I suppose they know, and somehow I feel as if I knew too. I feel as
if Silver Braid had won.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Randal</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Randal's home was gaunt as herself. Everything looked as if it had
been scraped, and the spare furniture expressed a meagre, lonely life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>)
dropped a plate as she (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) laid the table, and stood pathetically looking at
the pieces. When Esther asked for a teaspoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) gave way utterly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't one to give you; I had forgotten that they were gone. I should
have remembered and not asked you to tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It don't matter, Mrs. Randal; I can stir up my tea with anything--a
knitting-needle will do very well--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I should have remembered and not asked you back to tea; but I was so
miserable, and it is so lonely sitting in this house, that I could stand
it no longer... Talking to you saved me from thinking, and I did not want
to think until this race was over. If Silver Braid is beaten we are
ruined. Indeed, I don't know what will become of us. For fifteen years I
have borne up; I have lived on little at the best of times, and very often
have gone without; but that is nothing compared to the anxiety--to see him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)
come in with a white face, to see him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) drop into a chair and hear him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) say,
``Beaten a head on the post,'' or ``Broke down, otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) would have won
in a canter.'' I have always tried to be a good wife and tried to console
him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), and to do the best when he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, ``I have lost half a year's wages, I
don't know how we shall pull through.'' I have borne with ten thousand
times more than I can tell you. The sufferings of a gambler's wife cannot
be told. Tell me, what do you think my feelings must have been when one
night I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>gambler</b></font>) calling me out of my sleep, when I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>gambler</b></font>) say, ``I
can't die, Annie, without bidding you good-bye. I can only hope that you
will be able to pull through, and I know that the Gaffer will do all he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>)
can for you, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) has been hit awful hard too. You mustn't think too
badly of me, Annie, but I have had such a bad time that I couldn't put up
with it any longer, and I thought the best thing I could do would be to
go.<div class="bookquote">'' That's just how he (<font color='blue'><b>gambler</b></font>) talked--nice words to hear your husband speak in
your ear through the darkness! There was no time to send for the doctor,
so I jumped out of bed, put the kettle on, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) drink glass after
glass of salt and water. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) brought up the laudanum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther listened to the melancholy woman, and remembered the little man
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) saw every day so orderly, so precise, so sedate, so methodical,
so unemotional, into whose life she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thought no faintest emotion had ever
entered--and this was the truth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So long as I only had myself to think of I didn't mind; but now there are
the children growing up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) should think of them. Heaven only knows what
will become of them... John is as kind a husband as ever was if it weren't
for that one fault; but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) cannot resist having something on any more than
a drunkard can resist the bar-room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Winner, winner, winner of the Stewards' Cup!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The women</b></font>)</div><p/>The women started to their feet. When they got into the street the boy was
far away; besides, neither had a penny to pay for the paper, and they
wandered about the town hearing and seeing nothing, so nervous were they.
At last Esther proposed to ask at the <div class="bookquote">``Red Lion''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>who had won. Mrs. Randal
begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) to refrain, urging that she (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) was unable to bear the tidings
should it be evil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Silver Braid,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barman</b></font>)</div>the barman answered. The girl rushed through the doors.
<div class="bookquote">``It is all right, it is all right; he (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) has won!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div><p/>Soon after the little children in the lane were calling forth <div class="bookquote">``Silver
Braid won!''  (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div>And overcome by the excitement Esther walked along the
sea-road to meet the drag. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) walked on and on until the sound of the
horn came through the crimson evening and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) saw the leaders trotting in
a cloud of dust. Ginger was driving, and he (<font color='blue'><b>barman</b></font>) shouted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginger</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) won!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>The
Gaffer waved the horn and shouted, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) won!''  (<font color='red'><b>The Gaffer</b></font>)</div>Peggy waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) broken
parasol and shouted, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) won!''  (<font color='red'><b>Peggy</b></font>)</div>Esther looked at William. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) leaned over
the back seat and shouted, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) won!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had forgotten all about late
dinner. What would Mrs. Latch say? On such a day as this she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would say
nothing.




<p/>IX


<p/>Nearly everything came down untouched. Eating and drinking had been in
progress almost all day on the course, and Esther had finished washing up
before nine, and had laid the cloth in the servants' hall for supper. But
if little was eaten upstairs, plenty was eaten downstairs; the mutton was
finished in a trice, and Mrs. Latch had to fetch from the larder what
remained of a beefsteak pudding. Even then they were not satisfied, and
fine inroads were made into a new piece of cheese. Beer, according to
orders, was served without limit, and four bottles of port were sent down
so that the health of the horse might be adequately drunk.

<p/>While assuaging their hunger the men had exchanged many allusive remarks
regarding the Demon's bad ending, how nearly he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) had thrown the race away;
and the meal being now over, and there being nothing to do but to sit and
talk, Mr. Leopold, encouraged by William, entered on an elaborate and
technical account of the race. The women listened, playing with a rind of
cheese, glancing at the cheese itself, wondering if they could manage
another slice, and the men sipping their port wine, puffing at their
pipes, William listening most avidly of all, enjoying each sporting term,
and ingeniously reminding Mr. Leopold of some detail whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) seemed
disposed to shorten his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) narrative. The criticism of the Demon's
horsemanship took a long while, for by a variety of suggestive remarks
William led Mr. Leopold into reminiscences of the skill of certain famous
jockeys in the first half of the century. These digressions wearied Sarah
and Grover, and their thoughts wandered to the dresses that had been worn
that day, and the lady's-maid remembered she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) would hear all that
interested her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) that night in the young ladies' rooms. At last, losing all
patience, Sarah declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) didn't care what Chifney had said when
he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) just managed to squeeze his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) horse's head in front in the last dozen
yards, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) wanted to know what the Demon had done to so nearly lose the
race--had he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) mistaken the winning-post and pulled up? William looked at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) contemptuously, and would have answered rudely, but at that moment Mr.
Leopold began to tell the last instructions that the Gaffer had given the
Demon. The orders were that the Demon should go right up to the leaders
before they reached the half-mile, and remain there. Of course, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>)
found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) was a stone or more in hand, as the Gaffer expected, he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>)
might come away pretty well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) liked, for the greatest danger was that
the horse might get shut out or might show temper and turn it up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leopold</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Leopold, <div class="bookquote">``there were two false starts, and Silver Braid
must have galloped a couple of `undred yards afore the Demon could stop
him (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>). There wasn't twopence-halfpenny worth of strength in him (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>)--pulling off
those three or four pounds pretty well finished him (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>)'ll never be able
to ride that weight again... He (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) said afore starting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) felt weak;
you took him (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) along too smartly from Portslade the last time you went
there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leopold</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) went by himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>)'d stop playing marbles with the boys round the
Southwick public-house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``If there had been another false start I think it would have been all up
with us. The Gaffer was quite pale, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) stood there not taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>)
glasses from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) eyes. There were over thirty of them, so you can imagine
how hard it was to get them into line. However, at the third attempt they
were got straight and away they came, a black line stretching right across
the course. Presently the black cap and jacket came to the front, and not
very long after a murmur went round, ``Silver Braid wins.'' Never saw
anything like it in all my life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) was three lengths a`ead, and the
others were pulling off. ``Damn the boy; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll win by twenty lengths,<div class="bookquote">'' said
the Gaffer, without removing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) glasses. But when within a few yards of
the stand--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment the bell rang. Mr. Leopold said, <div class="bookquote">``There, they are wanting
their tea; I must go and get it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leopold</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Drat their tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Gale/Gale</b></font>)</div>said Margaret; <div class="bookquote">``they can wait. Finish up; tell us how he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
won.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Gale/Gale</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Leopold looked round, and seeing every eye fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) considered
how much remained of the story, and with quickened speech continued,
<div class="bookquote">``Well, approaching the stand, I noticed that Silver Braid was not going
quite so fast, and at the very instant the Demon looked over his (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) shoulder,
and seeing he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) was losing ground he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) took up the whip. But the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>)
struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) the horse swerved right across the course, right under the
stand, running like a rat from underneath the whip. The Demon caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>)
one across the nose with his (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) left hand, but seeing what was `appening, the
Tinman, who was on Bullfinch, sat down and began riding. I felt as if
there was a lump of ice down my back,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and Mr. Leopold lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) voice,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) face became grave as he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) recalled that perilous moment. <div class="bookquote">``I thought
it was all over,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) said, ``and the Gaffer thought the same; I never saw a
man go so deadly pale. It was all the work of a moment, but that moment
was more than a year--at least, so it seemed to me. Well, about half-way
up the rails the Tinman got level with the Demon. It was ten to one that
Silver Braid would turn it up, or that the boy wouldn't `ave the strength
to ride out so close a finish as it was bound to be. I thought then of the
way you used to take him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) along from Portslade, and I'd have given
something to've put a pound or two of flesh into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thighs and arms. The
Tinman was riding splendid, getting every ounce and something more out of
Bullfinch. The Demon, too weak to do much, was sitting nearly quite still.
It looked as if it was all up with us, but somehow Silver Braid took to
galloping of his (<font color='blue'><b>Braid</b></font>) own accord, and `aving such a mighty lot in `and he (<font color='blue'><b>Braid</b></font>) won
on the post by a `ead--a short `ead... I never felt that queer in my life
and the Gaffer was no better; but I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>), just afore the numbers
went up, ``It is all right, sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>)'s just done it,<div class="bookquote">'' and when the right
number went up I thought everything was on the dance, going for swim like.
By golly, it was a near thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>At the end of a long silence Mr. Leopold
said, shaking himself out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) thoughts, <div class="bookquote">``Now I must go and get their
tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leopold</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther sat at the end of the table; her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) cheek leaned on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hand. By
turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could see William. Sarah noticed one of these
stealthy backward glances and a look of anger crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) face, and
calling to William she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) when the sweepstakes money would be
divided. The question startled William from a reverie of small bets, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) answered that there was no reason why the sweepstakes money should not
be divided at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was twelve. That's right, isn't it?--Sarah, Margaret, Esther, Miss
Grover, Mr. Leopold, myself, the four boys, and Swindles and Wall...
Well, it was agreed that seven should go to the first, three to the
second, and two to the third. No one got the third `orse, so I suppose the
two shillings that would have gone to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) `ad better be given to the
first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Given to the first! Why, that's Esther! Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) get it?... What do
you mean? No third! Wasn't Soap-bubble third?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Soap-bubble was third right enough, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) wasn't in the sweep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) wasn't among the eleven first favourites. We took them as they
were quoted in the betting list published in the _Sportsman_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How was it, then, that you put in Silver Braid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yer needn't get so angry, Sarah, no one's cheating; it is all above
board. If you don't believe us, you'd better accuse us straight out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What I want to know is, why Silver Braid was included?--he (<font color='blue'><b>Braid</b></font>) wasn't among
the eleven first favourites.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't be so stupid, Sarah; you know that we agreed to make an
exception in favour of our own `orse--a nice sweep it would `ave been if
we `adn't included Silver Braid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) exclaimed, tightening her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) brows, <div class="bookquote">``that Soap-bubble had
won, what would have become of our money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would have been returned--everyone would have got his (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) shilling back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now I am to get three shillings, and that little Methodist or
Plymouth Brethren there, whatever you like to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), is to get nine!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>said Sarah, with a light of inspiration flashing through her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) beer-clouded
mind. <div class="bookquote">``Why should the two shillings that would have gone to Soap-bubble,
if anyone `ad drawn `im, go to the first `orse rather than to the second?''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>William hesitated, unable for the moment to give a good reason why the
extra two shillings should be given to Silver Braid; and Sarah, perceiving
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) advantage, deliberately accused him (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) of wishing to favour Esther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't we know that you went out to walk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), and that you remained
out till nearly eleven at night. That's why you want all the money to go
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>). You don't take us for a lot of fools, do you? Never in any place I
ever was in before would such a thing be allowed--the footman going out
with the kitchen-maid, and one of the Dissenting lot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not going to have my religion insulted! How dare you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>And Esther
started up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) place; but William was too quick for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) grasped
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind what Sarah says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind what I says! ...A thing like that, who never was in a
situation before; no doubt taken out of some `ouse. Rescue work, I think
they call it--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) shan't insult me--no, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) shan't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther, tremulous with
passion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A nice sort of person to insult!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>said Sarah, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) arms akimbo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now look you here, Sarah Tucker,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Latch</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Latch, starting from her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>)
seat, <div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to see that girl aggravated, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) may do what
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shouldn't do, and give you an opportunity of going to the missis with
tales about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Come away, Esther, come with me. Let them go on betting
if they will; I never saw no good come of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Latch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all very fine, mother; but it must be settled, and we have to
divide the money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want your money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther, sullenly; <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't take it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What blooming nonsense! You must take your money. Ah, here's Mr. Leopold!
he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>)'ll decide it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leopold</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Leopold said at once that the money that under other circumstances
would have gone to the third horse must be divided between the first and
second; but Sarah refused to accept this decision. Finally, it was
proposed that the matter should be referred to the editor of the
_Sportsman_; and as Sarah still remained deaf to argument, William offered
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) choice between the _Sportsman_ and the _Sporting Life_.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William, getting between the women; <div class="bookquote">``this evening isn't
one for fighting; we have all won our little bit, and ought to be
thankful. The only difference between you is two shillings, that were to
have gone to the third horse if anyone had drawn him (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>). Mr. Leopold says it
ought to be divided; you, Sarah, won't accept his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) decision. We have
offered to write to the _Sportsman_, and Esther has offered to give up her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
claim. Now, in the name of God, tell us what do you want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) raised some wholly irrelevant issue, and after a protracted argument
with William, largely composed of insulting remarks, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
wasn't going to take the two shillings, nor yet one of them; let them give
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) the three she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had won--that was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) wanted. William looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>),
shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) shoulders, and, after declaring that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) conviction
that women wasn't intended to have nothing to do with horse-racing, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
took up his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) pipe and tobacco-pouch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, ladies, I have had enough of you for to-night; I am going to
finish my smoke in the pantry. Don't scratch all your `air out; leave
enough for me to put into a locket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/>When the pantry door was shut, and the men had smoked some moments in
silence, William said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has any chance of winning the Chesterfield Cup?''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'ll win in a canter if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'ll only run straight. If I was the Gaffer I
think I'd put up a bigger boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll `ave to carry a seven-pound penalty,
and Johnnie Scott could ride that weight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>jockey</b></font>)</div><p/>The likelihood that a horse will bolt with one jockey and run straight
with another was argued passionately, and illustrated with interesting
reminiscences drawn from that remote past when Mr. Leopold was the
Gaffer's private servant--before either of them had married--when life was
composed entirely of horse-racing and prize-fighting. But cutting short
his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) tale of how he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) had met one day the Birmingham Chicken in a booth, and,
not knowing who he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) was, had offered to fight him (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>), Mr. Leopold confessed he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>)
did not know how to act--he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) had a bet of fifty pounds to ten shillings for
the double event; should he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) stand it out or lay some of it off? William
thrilled with admiration. What a `ead, and who'd think it? that little
`ead, hardly bigger than a cocoanut! What a brain there was inside! Fifty
pounds to ten shillings; should he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) stand it out or hedge some of it? Who
could tell better than Mr. Leopold? It would, of course, be a pity to
break into the fifty. What did ten shillings matter? Mr. Leopold was a big
enough man to stand the racket of it even if it didn't come back. William
felt very proud of being consulted, for Mr. Leopold had never before been
known to let anyone know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) had on a race.

<p/>Next day they walked into Shoreham together. The bar of the <div class="bookquote">``Red Lion''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>was
full of people. Above the thronging crowd the voice of the barman and the
customers were heard calling, <div class="bookquote">``Two glasses of Burton, glass of bitter,
three of whiskey cold.''  (<font color='red'><b>the customers</b></font>)</div>There were railway porters, sailors, boatmen,
shop-boys, and market gardeners. They had all won something, and had come
for their winnings.

<p/>Old Watkins, an elderly man with white whiskers and a curving stomach, had
just run in to wet his (<font color='blue'><b>Watkins</b></font>) whistle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Watkins</b></font>) walked back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Watkins</b></font>) office with Mr.
Leopold and William, a little corner shelved out of some out-houses, into
which you could walk from the street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Talk of favourites!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I'd sooner pay over the three first
favourites than this one--thirty, twenty to one starting price, and the
whole town onto him (<font color='blue'><b>Burton</b></font>); it's enough to break any man... Now, my men, what is
it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) said, turning to the railway porters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just the trifle me and my mates `av won over that `ere `orse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What was it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A shilling at five and twenty to one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look it out, Joey. Is it all right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir; yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>said the clerk.

<p/>And old Watkins slid his (<font color='blue'><b>Watkins</b></font>) hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>Watkins</b></font>) breeches pocket, and it came forth
filled with gold and silver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, mates, we are bound to `ave a bet on him (<font color='blue'><b>Joey</b></font>) for the
Chesterfield--we can afford it now; what say yer, a shilling each?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Done for a shilling each,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the under-porter; <div class="bookquote">``finest `orse in
training... What price, Musser Watkins?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten to one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Right, `ere's my bob.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The porters</b></font>)</div><p/>The other porters gave their shillings; Watkins slid them back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Watkins</b></font>)
pocket, and called to Joey to book the bet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And, now, what is yours, Mr. Latch?''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>William stated the various items. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had had a bet of ten shillings to one
on one race and had lost; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had had half-a-crown on another and had lost;
in a word, three-and-sixpence had to be subtracted from his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) winnings on
Silver Braid. These amounted to more than five pounds. William's face
flushed with pleasure, and the world seemed to be his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) slipped four
sovereigns and a handful of silver into his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) waistcoat pocket. Should he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
put a sovereign of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) winnings on Silver Braid for the Chesterfield?
Half-a-sovereign was enough! ...The danger of risking a sovereign--a whole
sovereign--frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Mr. Latch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Watkins</b></font>)</div>said old Watkins, <div class="bookquote">``if you want to back anything, make up
your mind; there are a good many besides yourself who have business with
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Watkins</b></font>)</div><p/>William hesitated, and then said he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)'d take ten half-sovereigns to one
against Silver Braid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten half-sovereigns to one?''  (<font color='red'><b>Watkins</b></font>)</div>said old Watkins.

<p/>William murmured <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>and Joey booked the bet.

<p/>Mr. Leopold's business demanded more consideration. The fat betting man
and the scarecrow little butler walked aside and talked, both apparently
indifferent to the impatience of a number of small customers; sometimes
Joey called in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joey</b></font>) shrill cracked voice if he (<font color='blue'><b>Joey</b></font>) might lay ten half-crowns to
one, or five shillings to one, as the case might be. Watkins would then
raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Watkins</b></font>) eyes from Mr. Leopold's face and nod or shake his (<font color='blue'><b>Watkins</b></font>) head, or
perhaps would sign with his (<font color='blue'><b>Watkins</b></font>) fingers what odds he (<font color='blue'><b>Watkins</b></font>) was prepared to lay. With
no one else would Watkins talk so lengthily, showing so much deference.
Mr. Leopold had the knack of investing all he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) did with an air of mystery,
and the deepest interest was evinced in this conversation. At last, as if
dismissing matters of first importance, the two men approached William,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) heard Watkins pressing Mr. Leopold to lay off some of that fifty
pounds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll take twelve to one--twenty-four pounds to two. Shall I book it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leopold</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Leopold shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) head, and, smiling enigmatically, said he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) must be
getting back. William was much impressed, and congratulated himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
courage in taking the ten half-sovereigns to one. Mr. Leopold knew a thing
or two; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) had been talking to the Gaffer that morning, and if it hadn't
been all right he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) would have laid off some of the money.

<p/>Next day one of the Gaffer's two-year-olds won a race, and the day after
Silver Braid won the Chesterfield Cup.

<p/>The second victory of Silver Braid nearly ruined old Watkins. He (<font color='blue'><b>Watkins</b></font>) declared
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Watkins</b></font>) had never been so hard hit; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Watkins</b></font>) did not ask for time and
continued to draw notes and gold and silver in handfuls from his (<font color='blue'><b>Watkins</b></font>) capacious
pockets, his (<font color='blue'><b>Watkins</b></font>) lamentations only served to stimulate the happiness of the
fortunate backers, and, listening to the sweet note of self ringing in
their hearts, they returned to the public-house to drink the health of the
horse.

<p/>So the flood of gold continued to roll into the little town, decrepit and
colourless by its high shingle beach and long reaches of muddy river. The
dear gold jingled merrily in the pockets, quickening the steps, lightening
the heart, curling lips with smiles, opening lips with laughter. The dear
gold came falling softly, sweetly as rain, soothing the hard lives of
working folk. Lives pressed with toil lifted up and began to dream again.
The dear gold was like an opiate; it wiped away memories of hardship and
sorrow, it showed life in a lighter and merrier guise, and the folk
laughed at their fears for the morrow and wondered how they could have
thought life so hard and relentless. The dear gold was pleasing as a bird
on the branch, as a flower on the stem; the tune it sang was sweet, the
colour it flaunted was bright.

<p/>The trade of former days had never brought the excitement and the fortune
that this horse's hoofs had done. The dust they had thrown up had fallen a
happy, golden shower upon Shoreham. In every corner and crevice of life
the glitter appeared. That fine red dress on the builder's wife, and the
feathers that the girls flaunt at their sweethearts, the loud trousers on
the young man's legs, the cigar in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth--all is Goodwood gold. It
glitters in that girl's ears and on this girl's finger.

<p/>It was said that the town of Shoreham had won two thousand pounds on the
race; it was said that Mr. Leopold had won two hundred; it was said that
William Latch had won fifty; it was said that Wall, the coachman, had won
five-and-twenty; it was said that the Gaffer had won forty thousand
pounds. For ten miles around nothing was talked of but the wealth of the
Barfields, and, drawn like moths to a candle, the county came to call;
even the most distant and reserved left cards, others walked up and down
the lawn with the Gaffer, listening to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) slightest word. A golden
prosperity shone upon the yellow Italian house. Carriages passed under its
elm-trees at every hour and swept round the evergreen oaks. Rumour said
that large alterations were going to be made, so that larger and grander
entertainments might be given; an Italian garden was spoken of,
balustrades and terraces, stables were in course of construction, many
more race-horses were bought; they arrived daily, and the slender
creatures, their dark eyes glancing out of the sight holes in their cloth
hoods, walked up from the station followed by an admiring and commenting
crowd. Drink and expensive living, dancing and singing upstairs and
downstairs, and the jollifications culminated in a servants' ball given at
the Shoreham Gardens. All the Woodview servants, excepting Mrs. Latch,
were there; likewise all the servants from Mr. Northcote's, and those from
Sir George Preston's--two leading county families. A great number of
servants had come from West Brighton, and Lancing, and Worthing
--altogether between two and three hundred. <div class="bookquote">``Evening dress is
indispensable''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was printed on the cards. The butlers, footmen, cooks,
ladies' maids, housemaids, and housekeepers hoped by this notification to
keep the ball select. But the restriction seemed to condemn Esther to play
again the part of Cinderella.




<p/>X


<p/>A group of men turned from the circular buffet when Esther entered. Miss
Mary had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a white muslin dress, a square-cut bodice with sleeves
reaching to the elbows, and a blue sash tied round the waist. The remarks
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) passed were, <div class="bookquote">``A nice, pretty girl.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>William was waiting, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
went away with him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) on the hop of a vigorous polka.

<p/>Many of the dancers had gone to get cool in the gardens, but a few couples
had begun to whirl, the women borne along by force, the men poising their
legs into curious geometrical positions.

<p/>Mr. Leopold was very busy dragging men away from the circular buffet--they
must dance whether they knew how or not.

<p/>``The Gaffer has told me partic`lar to see that the `gals' all had
partners, and just look down that `ere room; `alf of that lot `aven't been
on their legs yet. <div class="bookquote">``Ere's a partner for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and the butler pulled a
young gamekeeper towards a young girl who had just arrived. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) entered
slowly, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands clasped across her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bosom, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes fixed on the ground,
and the strangeness of the spectacle caused Mr. Leopold to pause. It was
whispered that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had never worn a low dress before, and Grover came to
the rescue of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) modesty with a pocket-handkerchief.

<p/>But it had been found impossible to restrict the ball to those who
possessed or could obtain an evening suit, and plenty of check trousers
and red neckties were hopping about. Among the villagers many a touch
suggested costume. A young girl had borrowed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) grandmother's wedding
dress, and a young man wore a canary-coloured waistcoat and a blue
coastguardsman's coat of old time. These touches of fancy and personal
taste divided the villagers from the household servants. The butlers
seemed on the watch for side dishes, and the valets suggested hair brushes
and hot water. Cooks trailed black silk dresses adorned with wide collars,
and fastened with gold brooches containing portraits of their late
husbands; and the fine shirt fronts set off with rich pearls, the
lavender-gloved hands, the delicate faces, expressive of ease and leisure,
made Ginger's two friends--young Mr. Preston and young Mr. Northcote
--noticeable among this menial, work-a-day crowd. Ginger loved the
upper circles, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Northcote</b></font>) romped the polka in the most approved
London fashion, his (<font color='blue'><b>Northcote</b></font>) elbows advanced like a yacht's bowsprit, and, his (<font color='blue'><b>Northcote</b></font>)
coat-tails flying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Northcote</b></font>) dashed through a group of tradespeople who were
bobbing up and down, hardly advancing at all.

<p/>Esther was now being spoken of as the belle of the ball, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had danced
with young Mr. Preston, and seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sitting alone Grover called her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) and
asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) why she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was not dancing. Esther answered sullenly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was
tired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, the next polka, just to show there is no ill-feeling.''  (<font color='red'><b>dozen</b></font>)</div>Half a dozen
times William repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) demand. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've spoilt all my pleasure in the dancing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry if I've done that, Esther. I was jealous, that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jealous! What was you jealous for? What do it matter what people think,
so long as I know I haven't done no wrong?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And in silence they walked into the garden. The night was warm, even
oppressive, and the moon hung like a balloon above the trees, and often
the straying revellers stopped to consider the markings now so plain upon
its disc. There were arbours, artificial ruins, darkling pathways, and the
breathless garden was noisy in the illusive light. William showed Esther
the theatre and explained its purpose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) listened, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not
understand, nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was not dreaming when they
suddenly stood on the borders of a beautiful lake full of the shadows of
tall trees, and crossed by a wooden bridge at the narrowest end.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How still the water is; and the stars, they are lovely!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should see the gardens about three o'clock on Saturday afternoons,
when the excursion comes in from Brighton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked on a little further, and Esther said, <div class="bookquote">``What's these places?
Ain't they dark?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These are arbours, where we `as shrimps and tea. I'll take you next
Saturday, if you'll come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div><p/>A noisy band of young men, followed by three or four girls, ran across the
bridge. Suddenly they stopped to argue on which side the boat was to be
found. Some chose the left, some the right; those who went to the right
sent up a yell of triumph, and paddled into the middle of the water. They
first addressed remarks to their companions, and then they admired the
moon and stars. A song was demanded, and at the end of the second verse
William threw his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) arm round Esther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Esther, I do love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) grey eyes fixed in a long interrogation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder if that is true. What is there to love in me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) squeezed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) tightly, and continued his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) protestations. <div class="bookquote">``I do, I do, I
do love you, Esther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not answer, and they walked slowly on. A holly bush threw a black
shadow on the gravel path and a moment after the ornamental tin roof of
the dancing room appeared between the trees.

<p/>Even in their short absence a change had come upon the ball. About the
circular buffet numbers of men called for drink, and talked loudly of
horse-racing. Many were away at supper, and those that remained were
amusing themselves in a desultory fashion. A tall, lean woman, dressed
like Sarah in white muslin, wearing amber beads round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) neck, was
dancing the lancers with the Demon, and everyone shook with laughter when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) whirled the little fellow round or took him (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) arms and carried
him (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) across. William wanted to dance, but Esther was hungry, and led him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
away to an adjoining building where cold beef, chicken, and beer might be
had by the strong and adventurous. As they struggled through the crowd
Esther spied three young gentlemen at the other end of the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now tell me, if they ask me, the young gents yonder, to dance, am I to
look them straight in the face and say no?''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>William considered a moment, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I think you had better
dance with them if they asks you; if you refuse, Sarah will say it was I
who put you up to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's have another bottle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginger</b></font>)</div>cried Ginger. <div class="bookquote">``Come, what do you say, Mr.
Thomas?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Mr. Thomas</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Thomas coughed, smiled, and said that Mr. Arthur wished to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) in
the hands of the police. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) promised to drink his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) share. Two more
bottles were sent for, and, stimulated by the wine, the weights that would
probably be assigned to certain horses in the autumn handicap were
discussed. William was very proud of being admitted into such company, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) listened, a cigar which he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) did not like between his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) teeth, and a glass
of champagne in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hand... Suddenly the conversation was interrupted by
the cornet sounding the first phrase of a favourite waltz, and the tipsy
and the sober hastened away.

<p/>Neither Esther nor William knew how to waltz, but they tumbled round the
room, enjoying themselves immensely. In the polka and mazurka they got on
better; and there were quadrilles and lancers in which the gentlemen
joined, and all were gay and pleasant; even Sarah's usually sour face
glowed with cordiality when they joined hands and raced round the men
standing in the middle. In the chain they lost themselves as in a
labyrinth and found their partners unexpectedly. But the dance of the
evening was Sir Roger de Coverley, and Esther's usually sober little brain
evaporated in the folly of running up the room, then turning and running
backwards, getting into her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) place as best she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could, and then starting
again. It always appeared to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) turn, and it was so sweet to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
dear William, and such a strange excitement to run forward to meet young
Mr. Preston, to curtsey to him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), and then run away; and this over and over
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's the dawn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther looked, and in the whitening doorways she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) saw the little jockey
staggering about helplessly drunk. The smile died out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) true self, to Mrs. Barfield and the Brethren. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) felt
that all this dancing, drinking, and kissing in the arbours was wicked.
But Miss Mary had sent for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dresses, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not known how to refuse Miss Mary. Then,
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not gone, William--Sounds of loud voices were heard in the
garden, and the lean woman in the white muslin repeated some charge.
Esther ran out to see what was happening, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) witnessed a
disgraceful scene. The lean woman in the muslin dress and the amber beads
accused young Mr. Preston of something which he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) denied, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heard
William tell someone that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was mistaken, that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) pals didn't
want no rowing at this `ere ball, and what was more they didn't mean to
have none.

<p/>And her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart filled with love for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) big William. What a fine fellow he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
was! how handsome were his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) shoulders beside that round-shouldered little
man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) so easily pulled aside! and having crushed out the quarrel, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
helped her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) on with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) jacket, and, hanging on his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) arm, they returned home
through the little town. Margaret followed with the railway porter; Sarah
was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) faithful admirer, a man with a red beard, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had picked
up at the ball; Grover waddled in the rear, embarrassed with the green
silk, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) held high out of the dust of the road.

<p/>When they reached the station the sky was stained with rose, and the
barren downs--more tin-like than ever in the shadow-less light of
dawn--stretched across the sunrise from Lancing to Brighton. The little
birds sat ruffling their feathers, and, awaking to the responsibilities of
the day, flew away into the corn. The night had been close and sultry, and
even at this hour there was hardly any freshness in the air. Esther looked
at the hills, examining the landscape intently. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was thinking of the
first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) saw it. Some vague association of ideas--the likeness that
the morning landscape bore to the evening landscape, or the wish to
prolong the sweetness of these, the last moments of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) happiness,
impelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to linger and to ask William if the woods and fields were not
beautiful. The too familiar landscape awoke in William neither idea nor
sensation; Esther interested him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) more, and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) gazed dreamily on the
hills he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) admired the white curve of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) neck which showed beneath the
unbuttoned jacket. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) never looked prettier than she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did that morning,
standing on the dusty road, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) white dress crumpled, the ends of the blue
sash hanging beneath the black cloth jacket.




<p/>XI


<p/>For days nothing was talked of but the ball--how this man had danced, the
bad taste of this woman's dress, and the possibility of a marriage. The
ball had brought amusement to all, to Esther it had brought happiness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
happiness was now visible in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) face and audible in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) voice, and
Sarah's ironical allusions to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) inability to learn to read no longer
annoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), no longer stirred her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) temper--her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) love seemed to induce
forgiveness for all and love for everything.

<p/>In the evenings when their work was done Esther and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) lover lingered
about the farm buildings, listening to the rooks, seeing the lights die in
the west; and in the summer darkness about nine she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) tripped by his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) side
when he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) took the letters to post. The wheat stacks were thatching, and in
the rickyard, in the carpenter's shop, and in the whist of the woods they
talked of love and marriage. They lay together in the warm valleys,
listening to the tinkling of the sheep-bell, and one evening, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>)
pipe aside, William threw his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), whispering that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
wife. The words were delicious in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) fainting ears, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) will died in
what seemed like irresistible destiny. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not struggle with him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>),
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) fate depended upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) resistance, and swooning
away she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) awakened in pain, powerless to free herself... Soon after
thoughts betook themselves on their painful way, and the stars were
shining when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) across the down, beseeching her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to listen.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) fled along the grey road and up the stairs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) room. Margaret
was in bed, and awakening a little asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) what had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) out so
late. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did not answer... and hearing Margaret fall asleep she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
remembered the supper-table. Sarah, who had come in late, had sat down by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>); William sat on the opposite side; Mrs. Latch was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) place, the
jockeys were all together; Mr. Swindles, his (<font color='blue'><b>Swindles</b></font>) snuff-box on the table;
Margaret and Grover. Everyone had drunk a great deal; and Mr. Leopold had
gone to the beer cellar many times. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) remembered
feeling a little dizzy when William asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to come for a stroll up the
hill. They had passed through the hunting gate; they had wandered into the
loneliness of the hills. Over the folded sheep the rooks came home noisily
through a deepening sky. So far she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) remembered, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not remember
further; and all night lay staring into the darkness, and when Margaret
called her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) in the morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was pale and deathlike.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever is the matter? You do look ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not sleep all last night. My head aches as if it would drop off. I
don't feel as if I could go to work to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the worst of being a servant. Well or ill, it makes no matter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) turned from the glass, and holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hair in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) left hand, leaned
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) might pin it. <div class="bookquote">``You do look bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) remarked dryly.

<p/>Never had they been so late! Half-past seven, and the shutters still up!
So said Margaret as they hurried downstairs. But Esther thought only of
the meeting with William. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) cleaning boots in the pantry as
they passed. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) waited till Margaret left her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), till he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) heard the baize
door which separated the back premises from the front of the house close,
then he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) ran to the kitchen, where he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) expected to find Esther alone. But
meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mumbled some excuse and retreated. There were
visitors in the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had a good deal to do that morning, and Esther
kept close to Mrs. Latch; but at breakfast it suddenly became necessary
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) should answer him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and Sarah saw that Esther and William were no
longer friends.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well I never! Look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sits there over her (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) tea-cup as melancholy
as a prayer-meeting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's it to me? I don't like an ugly face at the breakfast-table, that's
all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't be your looking-glass, then. Luckily there isn't one here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div><p/>In the midst of an angry altercation, Esther walked out of the room.
During dinner she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hardly spoke at all. After dinner she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) room,
and did not come down until she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had gone out with the carriage.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was too soon, William came running down the passage to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hand supplicatingly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't touch me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes filled with dangerous light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Esther! ...Come, don't lay it on too thick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away. Don't speak to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just listen one moment, that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away. If you don't, I'll go straight to Mrs. Barfield.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) passed into the kitchen and shut the door in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had gone a
trifle pale, and after lingering a few moments he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hurried away to the
stables, and Esther saw him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) spring on the box.

<p/>As it was frequent with Esther not to speak to anyone with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had
had a dispute for a week or fifteen days, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) continued sulk excited
little suspicion, and the cause of the quarrel was attributed to some
trifle. Sarah said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Men are such fools. He (<font color='blue'><b>Men</b></font>) is always begging of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Men</b></font>). Just look
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Men</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Men</b></font>) is still after her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>), following her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) into the wood-shed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) rarely answered him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) a yes or no, but would push past him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
forcibly barred the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``Let me go by, will you? You are
interfering with my work.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) still insisted, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) spoke of
appealing to Mrs. Barfield. And if her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) heart sometimes softened, and an
insidious thought whispered that it did not matter since they were going
to be married, instinct forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) to repel him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) instinct was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>)
could only win his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) respect by refusing forgiveness for a long while. The
religion in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) soul moved and lived--the sternest
Protestantism--strengthened and enforced the original convictions and the
prejudices of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) race; and the natural shame which she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) had first felt
almost disappeared in the violence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) virtue. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) even ceased to fear
discovery. What did it matter who knew, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) knew? She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>)
heart to God. Christ looked down, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) seemed stern and unforgiving. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>)
Christ was the Christ of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) forefathers; and He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) had not forgiven, because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) could not forgive herself. Hers was the unpardonable sin, the sin
which her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) race had elected to fight against, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) lay down weary and
sullen at heart.

<p/>The days seemed to bring no change, and wearied by her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) stubbornness,
William said, <div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) sulk,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) went out with Sarah; and when Esther
saw them go down the yard her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heart said, <div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Men</b></font>) take her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) out, I don't
want him (<font color='blue'><b>Men</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>For she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knew it to be a trick to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) jealous, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
should dare such a trick angered her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) still further against him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and when
they met in the garden, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had gone with some food for the cats,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, Esther, I only went out with Sarah because you
drove me wild,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) teeth and refused to answer. But he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) stood
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) path, determined not to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am very fond of you, Esther,
and I will marry you as soon as I have earned enough or won enough money
to give you a comfortable `ome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a wicked man; I will never marry you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry, Esther. But I am not as bad as you think for. You let
your temper get the better of you. So soon as I have got a bit of money
together--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will if you like, but the truth is that I have only three pounds in the
world. I have been unlucky lately--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think of nothing but that wicked betting. Come, let me pass; I'm not
going to listen to a lot of lies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``After the Leger--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me pass. I will not speak to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But look here, Esther: marriage or no marriage, we can't go on in this
way: they'll be suspecting something shortly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall leave Woodview.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had hardly spoken the words when it seemed
clear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) must leave, and the sooner the better. <div class="bookquote">``Come, let me
pass... If Mrs. Barfield--''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>An angry look passed over William's face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to act honest with you, and you won't let me. If ever there was a
sulky pig! ...Sarah's quite right; you are just the sort that would make
hell of a man's life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was bound to make him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) respect her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had vaguely felt from the
beginning that this was her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) only hope, and now the sensation developed and
defined itself into a thought and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) decided that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would not yield,
but would continue to affirm her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) must acknowledge his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sin,
and then come and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). Above all things, Esther desired
to see William repentant. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) natural piety, filling as it did her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) entire
life, unconsciously made her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) deem repentance an essential condition of
their happiness. How could they be happy if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) were not a God-fearing man?
This question presented itself constantly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was suddenly convinced
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not marry him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) until he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had asked forgiveness of the Lord.
Then they would be joined together, and would love each other faithfully
unto death.

<p/>But in conflict with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) prejudices, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) natural love of the man was as
the sun shining above a fog-laden valley; rays of passion pierced her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
stubborn nature, dissolving it, and unconsciously her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes sought
William's, and unconsciously her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) steps strayed from the kitchen when her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
ears told her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was in the passage. But when her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) love went out freely to
William, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) longed to throw herself in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) arms, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I
love you; make me your wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) noticed, or thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) noticed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
avoided her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) felt that thoughts of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knew nothing had
obtained a footing in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mind, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was full of foreboding.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heart being intent on him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was aware of much that escaped the
ordinary eye, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was the first to notice when the drawing-room bell
rang, and Mr. Leopold rose, that William would say, <div class="bookquote">``My legs are the
youngest, don't you stir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>No one else, not even Sarah, thought William intended more than to keep in
Mr. Leopold's good graces, but Esther, although unable to guess the truth,
heard the still tinkling bell ringing the knell of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hopes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) noted,
too, the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) remained upstairs, and asked herself anxiously what it
was that detained him (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) so long. The weather had turned colder lately...
Was it a fire that was wanted? In the course of the afternoon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heard
from Margaret that Miss Mary and Mrs. Barfield had gone to Southwick to
make a call, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard from one of the boys that the Gaffer and Ginger
had ridden over in the morning to Fendon Fair, and had not yet returned.
It must have been Peggy who had rung the bell. Peggy? Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>)
remembered something--something that had been forgotten. The first Sunday,
the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) went to the library for family prayers, Peggy was
sitting on the little green sofa, and as Esther passed across the room to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) place she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) cast a glance of admiration on William's tall
figure, and the memory of that glance had flamed up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) brain, and all
that night Esther saw the girl with the pale face and the coal-black hair
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) William.

<p/>Next day Esther waited for the bell that was to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) lover from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).
The afternoon wore slowly away, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had begun to hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was mistaken
when the metal tongue commenced calling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heard the baize door close
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>); but the bell still continued to utter little pathetic notes. A
moment after all was still in the corridor, and like one sunk to the knees
in quicksands she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) felt that the time had come for a decided effort. But
what could she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) do? She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not follow him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to the drawing-room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had
begun to notice that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) seemed to avoid her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and by his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) conduct seemed to
wish that their quarrel might endure. But pride and temper had fallen from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) lived conscious of him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), noting every sign, and intensely, all
that related to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), divining all his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) intentions, and meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) in the
passage when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) least expected her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm always getting in your way,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, with a low, nervous laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No harm in that; ...fellow servants; there must be give and take.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>Tremblingly they looked at each other, feeling that the time had come,
that an explanation was inevitable, but at that moment the drawing-room
bell rang above their heads, and William said, <div class="bookquote">``I must answer that bell.''
 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) turned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and passed through the baize door before she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had said
another word.

<p/>Sarah remarked that William seemed to spend a great deal of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) time in
the drawing-room, and Esther started out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) moody contemplation, and,
speaking instinctively, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I don't think much of ladies who go
after their servants.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Everyone looked up. Mrs. Latch laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) carving-knife on the meat and
fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>said Sarah; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)'s no lady! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) mother used to mop out the yard
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was `churched.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can tell you what,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William, <div class="bookquote">``you had better mind what you are
a-saying of, for if any of your talk got wind upstairs you'd lose yer
situation, and it might be some time before yer got another!''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lose my situation! and a good job, too. I shall always be able to suit
mesel'; don't you fear about me. But if it comes to talking about
situations, I can tell you that you are more likely to lose yours than I
am to lose mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>William hesitated, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sought a judicious reply Mrs. Latch and
Mr. Leopold, putting forth their joint authority, brought the discussion
to a close. The jockey-boys exchanged grins, Sarah sulked, Mr. Swindles
pursed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Swindles</b></font>) mouth in consideration, and the elder servants felt that the
matter would not rest in the servant's hall; that evening it would be the
theme of conversation in the <div class="bookquote">``Red Lion,''  (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div>and the next day it would be the
talk of the town.

<p/>About four o'clock Esther saw Mrs. Barfield, Miss Mary, and Peggy walk
across the yard towards the garden, and as Esther had to go soon after to
the wood-shed she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) saw Peggy slip out of the garden by a bottom gate and
make her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) way through the evergreens. Esther hastened back to the kitchen
and stood waiting for the bell to ring. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had not to wait long; the bell
tinkled, but so faintly that Esther said, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) only just touched it; it is
a signal; he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was on the look-out for it; she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) did not want anyone else to
hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther remembered the thousands of pounds she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had heard that the young
lady possessed, and the beautiful dresses she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wore. There was no hope for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). How could there be? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) poor little wages and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) print dress! He (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
would never look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) again! But oh! how cruel and wicked it was! How
could one who had so much come to steal from one who had so little? Oh, it
was very cruel and very wicked, and no good would come of it either to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
or to him (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>); of that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) felt quite sure. God always punished the wicked.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did not love Peggy. It was sin and shame; and after his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
promises--after what had happened. Never would she (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) have believed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to be
so false. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) thought turned to passionate hatred of the girl who had
so cruelly robbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had gone through that baize door, and no doubt
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was sitting by Peggy in the new drawing-room. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had gone where she (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>)
could not follow. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had gone where the grand folk lived in idleness, in
the sinfulness of the world and the flesh, eating and gambling, thinking
of nothing else, and with servants to wait on them, obeying their orders
and saving them from every trouble. She (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) knew that these fine folk thought
servants inferior beings. But was she (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) not of the same flesh and blood as
they? Peggy wore a fine dress, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) was no better; take off her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) dress
and they were the same, woman to woman.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) pushed through the door and walked down the passage. A few steps
brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) to the foot of a polished oak staircase, lit by a large window
in coloured glass, on either side of which there were statues. The
staircase sloped slowly to an imposing landing set out with columns and
blue vases and embroidered curtains. The girl saw these things vaguely,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was conscious of a profusion of rugs, matting, and bright doors,
and of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) inability to decide which door was the drawing-room door--the
drawing-room of which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had heard so much, and where even now, amid gold
furniture and sweet-scented air, William listened to the wicked woman who
had tempted him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) away from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Suddenly William appeared, and seeing
Esther he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) seemed uncertain whether to draw back or come forward. Then his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
face took an expression of mixed fear and anger; and coming rapidly
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing here?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>... then changing his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``This is against
the rules of the `ouse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to see her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything else? What do you want to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)? I won't have it, I tell
you... What do you mean by spying after me? That's your game, is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>With averted face the young lady fled up the oak staircase, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
handkerchief to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lips. Esther made a movement as if to follow, but
William prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) turned and walked down the passage and entered
the kitchen. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) face was one white tint, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) short, strong arms hung
tremblingly, and William saw that it would be better to temporise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now look here, Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you ought to be damned thankful to me
for having prevented you from making a fool of yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther's eyelids quivered, and then her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes dilated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, if Miss Margaret,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>continued William, <div class="bookquote">``had--''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away! go away! I am--''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>At that moment the steel of a large,
sharp-pointed knife lying on the table caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eye. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) snatched it up,
and seeing blood she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) rushed at him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).

<p/>William retreated from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and Mrs. Latch, coming suddenly in, caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
arm. Esther threw the knife; it struck the wall, falling with a rattle on
the meat screen. Escaping from Mrs. Latch, she (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) rushed to secure it, but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) strength gave way, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) fell back in a dead faint.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you been doing to the girl?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Latch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, mother... We had a few words, that was all. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said I should
not go out with Sarah.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not true... I can read the lie in your face; a girl doesn't take
up a knife unless a man well-nigh drives her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right; always side against your son! ...If you don't believe me,
get what you can out of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And, turning on his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) heel, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) walked
out of the house.

<p/>Mrs. Latch saw him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) pass down the yard towards the stables, and when Esther
opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looked at Mrs. Latch questioningly, unable to
understand why the old woman was standing by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you better now, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but--but what--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then remembrance struggled back. <div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) gone? Did I
strike him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)? I remember that I--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did not hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) again. Far better not. I was mad. I did not know
what I was doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will tell me about it another time, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)? tell me that; I must know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gone to the stables, I think; but you must not go after him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)--you'll see
him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not want to go after him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) isn't hurt? That's what I want to
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) isn't hurt... You're getting stronger... Lean on me. You'll
begin to feel better when you are in bed. I'll bring you up your tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I shall be all right presently. But how'll you manage to get the
dinner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you worry about that; you go upstairs and lie down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>A desolate hope floated over the surface of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brain that William might
be brought back to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>In the evening the kitchen was full of people: Margaret, Sarah, and Grover
were there, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) heard that immediately after lunch Mr. Leopold had
been sent for, and the Gaffer had instructed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) to pay William a month's
wages, and see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) left the house that very instant. Sarah, Margaret,
and Grover watched Esther's face and were surprised at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) indifference.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) even seemed pleased. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was pleased; nothing better could have
happened. William was now separated from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) rival, and released from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
bad influence he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would return to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) real love. At the first sign she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
would go to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) would forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). But a little later, when the
dishes came down from the dining-room, it was whispered that Peggy was not
there.

<p/>Later in the evening, when the servants were going to bed, it became known
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) had left the house, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) had taken the six o'clock to
Brighton. Esther turned from the foot of the stair with a wild look.
Margaret caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no use, dear; you can do nothing to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can walk to Brighton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you can't; you don't know the way, and even if you did you don't know
where they are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/>Neither Sarah nor Grover made any remark, and in silence the servants went
to their rooms. Margaret closed the door and turned to look at Esther, who
had fallen on the chair, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes fixed in vacancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what it is; I was the same when Jim Story got the sack. It seems
as if one couldn't live through it, and yet one does somehow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder if they'll marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most probable. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has a lot of money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Two days after a cab stood in the yard in front of the kitchen window.
Peggy's luggage was being piled upon it--two large, handsome basket boxes
with the initials painted on them. Kneeling on the box-seat, the coachman
leaned over the roof making room for another--a small box covered with red
cowhide and tied with a rough rope. The little box in its poor simplicity
brought William back to Esther, whelming her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) for a moment in so acute a
sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) loss that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had to leave the kitchen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) went into the
scullery, drew the door after her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), sat down, and hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
apron. A stifled sob or two, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) habitual gravity
of expression, and continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) work as if nothing had happened.




<p/>XII


<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are just crazy about it upstairs. Ginger and the Gaffer are the
worst. They say they had better sell the place and build another house
somewhere else. None of the county people will call on them now--and just
as they were beginning to get on so well! Miss Mary, too, is terrible cut
up about it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) says it will interfere with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) prospects, and that
Ginger has nothing to do now but to marry the kitchen-maid to complete the
ruin of the Barfields.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Mary is far too kind to say anything to wound another's feelings. It
is only a nasty old deceitful thing like yourself who could think of such
a thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, you got it there, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>said Sarah, who had had a difference with
Grover, and was anxious to avenge it.

<p/>Grover looked at Sarah in astonishment, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) look clearly said, <div class="bookquote">``Is
everyone going to side with that little kitchen-maid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, to flatter Mrs. Latch, Sarah spoke of the position the Latches had
held three generations ago; the Barfields were then nobodies; they had
nothing even now but their money, and that had come out of a livery
stable. <div class="bookquote">``And it shows, too; just compare Ginger with young Preston or
young Northcote. Anyone could tell the difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther listened with an unmoved face and a heavy ache in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
had now not an enemy nor yet an opponent; the cause of rivalry and
jealousy being removed, all were sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). They recognised that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
had suffered and was suffering, and seeing none but friends about her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
was led to think how happy she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) might have been in this beautiful house if
it had not been for William. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) work, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was working for
those she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) loved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could imagine no life happier than hers might have
been. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had sinned, and the Lord had punished her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) for sin, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
must bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) punishment uncomplainingly, giving Him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) thanks that He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had
imposed no heavier one upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).

<p/>Such reflection was the substance of Esther's mind for three months after
William's departure; and in the afternoons, about three o'clock, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
work paused, Esther's thoughts would congregate and settle on the great
misfortune of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) life--William's desertion.

<p/>It was one afternoon at the beginning of December; Mrs. Latch had gone
upstairs to lie down. Esther had drawn her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) chair towards the fire. A
broken-down race-horse, his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) legs bandaged from his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) knees to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) fetlocks,
had passed up the yard; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was going for walking exercise on the downs,
and when the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hoofs had died away Esther was quite alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
sat on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wooden chair facing the wide kitchen window. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had advanced
one foot on the iron fender; her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) head leaned back, rested on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
did not think--her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mind was lost in vague sensation of William, and it was
in this death of active memory that something awoke within her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), something
that seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) like a flutter of wings; her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heart seemed to drop from
its socket, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) nearly fainted away, but recovering herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) stood
by the kitchen table, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) arms drawn back and pressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sides, a
death-like pallor over her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) face, and drops of sweat on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) forehead. The
truth was borne in upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) realised in a moment part of the awful
drama that awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and from which nothing could free her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would have to live through hour by hour. So dreadful did it seem, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) brain must give way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would have to leave Woodview. Oh,
the shame of confession! Mrs. Barfield, who had been so good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>), and
who thought so highly of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) father would not have her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) at home; she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>)
would be homeless in London. No hope of obtaining a situation... they
would send her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) away without a character, homeless in London, and every
month her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) position growing more desperate...

<p/>A sickly faintness crept up through her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>). The flesh had come to the relief
of the spirit; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) sank upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) chair, almost unconscious, sick, it
seemed, to death, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) rose from the chair wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) forehead slowly
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) apron... She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) might be mistaken. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>)
hands, and then, falling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) knees, her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) arms thrown forward upon the
table, she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) prayed for strength to walk without flinching under any cross
that He (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) had thought fit to lay upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>).

<p/>There was still the hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) might be mistaken; and this hope lasted
for one week, for two, but at the end of the third week it perished, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) abandoned herself in prayer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) prayed for strength to endure with
courage what she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) now knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) must endure, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) prayed for light to
guide her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) present decision. Mrs. Barfield, however much she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) might
pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>), could not keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) once she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) knew the truth, whereas none might
know the truth if she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) did not tell it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) might remain at Woodview
earning another quarter's wages; the first she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) had spent on boots and
clothes, the second she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) had just been paid. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) stayed on for another
quarter she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) would have eight pounds, and with that money, and much less
time to keep herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) might be able to pull through. But would she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) be
able to go undetected for nearly three whole months, until her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) next wages
came due? She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) must risk it.

<p/>Three months of constant fear and agonising suspense wore away, and no
one, not even Margaret, suspected Esther's condition. Encouraged by her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
success, and seeing still very little sign of change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) person, and as
every penny she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could earn was of vital consequence in the coming time,
Esther determined to risk another month; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would give notice and
leave. Another month passed, and Esther was preparing for departure when a
whisper went round, and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could take steps to leave she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was told
that Mrs. Barfield wished to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) in the library. Esther turned a
little pale, and the expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) face altered; it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
impossible to go before Mrs. Barfield and admit her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) shame. Margaret, who
was standing near and saw what was passing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mind, said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pull yourself together, Esther. You know the Saint--she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)'s not a bad sort.
Like all the real good ones, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) is kind enough to the faults of others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Gale/Gale</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's this? What's the matter with Esther?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Latch</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Latch, who had not
yet heard of Esther's misfortune.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you presently, Mrs. Latch. Go, dear, get it over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther hurried down the passage and passed through the baize door without
further thought. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had then but to turn to the left and a few steps
would bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to the library door. The room was already present in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could see it. The dim light, the little green sofa, the round
table covered with books, the piano at the back, the parrot in the corner,
and the canaries in the window. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knocked at the door. The well-known
voice said, <div class="bookquote">``Come in.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) turned the handle, and found herself alone with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mistress. Mrs. Barfield laid down the book she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) was reading, and looked
up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) did not look as angry as Esther had imagined, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) voice was
harder than usual.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this true, Esther?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther hung down her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not speak at first; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you were a good girl, Esther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So did I, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barfield/Barfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Barfield looked at the girl quickly, hesitated a moment, and then
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And all this time--how long is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nearly seven months, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And all this time you were deceiving us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was three months gone before I knew it myself, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Three months! Then for three months you have knelt every Sunday in prayer
in this room, for twelve Sundays you sat by me learning to read, and you
never said a word?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barfield/Barfield</b></font>)</div><p/>A certain harshness in Mrs. Barfield's voice awakened a rebellious spirit
in Esther, and a lowering expression gathered above her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Had I told you, you would have sent me away then and there. I had only a
quarter's wages, and should have starved or gone and drowned myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry to hear you speak like that, Esther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is trouble that makes me, ma'am, and I have had a great deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you not confide in me? I have not shown myself cruel to you, have
I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, ma'am. You are the best mistress a servant ever had, but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, ma'am, it is this way... I hated being deceitful--indeed I did. But
I can no longer think of myself. There is another to think for now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barfield/Barfield</b></font>)</div><p/>There was in Mrs. Barfield's look something akin to admiration, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>)
felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) had not been wholly wrong in her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) estimate of the girl's
character; she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) said, and in a different intonation--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you were right, Esther. I couldn't have kept you on, on account
of the bad example to the younger servants. I might have helped you with
money. But six months alone in London and in your condition! ...I am glad
you did not tell me, Esther; and as you say there is another to think of
now, I hope you will never neglect your child, if God give it to you
alive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not, ma'am; I shall try and do my best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor girl! my poor girl! you do not know what trial is in store for
you. A girl like you, and only twenty! ...Oh, it is a shame! May God give
you courage to bear up in your adversity!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know there is many a hard time before me, but I have prayed for
strength, and God will give me strength, and I must not complain. My case
is not so bad as many another. I have nearly eight pounds. I shall get on,
ma'am, that is to say if you will stand by me and not refuse me a
character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I give you a character? You were tempted, you were led into
temptation. I ought to have watched over you better--mine is the
responsibility. Tell me, it was not your fault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is always a woman's fault, ma'am. But he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) should not have deserted me
as he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) did, that's the only thing I reproach him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) with, the rest was my
fault--I shouldn't have touched the second glass of ale. Besides, I was in
love with him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), and you know what that is. I thought no harm, and I let him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
kiss me. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) used to take me out for walks on the hill and round the farm.
He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) told me he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) loved me, and would make me his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wife--that's how it was.
Afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) asked me to wait till after the Leger, and that riled me,
and I knew then how wicked I had been. I would not go out with him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) or
speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) any more; and while our quarrel was going on Miss Peggy went
after him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), and that's how I got left.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peggy</b></font>)</div><p/>At the mention of Peggy's name a cloud passed over Mrs. Barfield's face.
<div class="bookquote">``You have been shamefully treated, my poor child. I knew nothing of all
this. So he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) would marry you if he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) won his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) bet on the Leger? Oh,
that betting! I know that nothing else is thought of here; upstairs and
downstairs, the whole place is poisoned with it, and it is the fault of--''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barfield/Barfield</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Barfield walked hurriedly across the room, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) turned the
sight of Esther provoked her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) into speech. <div class="bookquote">``I have seen it all my life,
nothing else, and I have seen nothing come of it but sin and sorrow; you
are not the first victim. Ah, what ruin, what misery, what death!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barfield/Barfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Barfield covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) face with her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) hands, as if to shut out the
memories that crowded upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, ma'am, if you will excuse my saying so, that a great deal of
harm do come from this betting on race-horses. The day when you was all
away at Goodwood when the horse won, I went down to see what the sea was
like here. I was brought up by the seaside at Barnstaple. On the beach I
met Mrs. Leopold, that is to say Mrs. Randal, John's wife; she (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) seemed to
be in great trouble, she (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) looked that melancholy, and for company's sake
she (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) asked me to come home to tea with her (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) was in that state of mind,
ma'am, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) forgot the teaspoons were in pawn, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) could not
give me one she (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) broke down completely, and told me what her (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) troubles had
been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did she (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) tell you, Esther?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hardly remember, ma'am, but it was all the same thing--ruin if the
horse didn't win, and more betting if he (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) did. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) said they never had
been in such a fix as the day Silver Braid won. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) had been beaten they
would have been thrown out on the street, and from what I have heard the
best half of the town too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So that little man has suffered. I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was wiser than the rest...
This house has been the ruin of the neighbourhood; we have dispensed vice
instead of righteousness.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barfield/Barfield</b></font>)</div>Walking towards the window, Mrs. Barfield
continued to talk to herself. <div class="bookquote">``I have struggled against the evil all my
life, and without result. How much more misery shall I see come of it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Turning then to Esther she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, the betting is an evil--one from
which many have suffered--but the question is now about yourself, Esther.
How much money have you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have about eight pounds, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how much do you reckon will see you through it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, ma'am, I have no experience. I think father will let me
stay at home if I can pay my way. I could manage easily on seven shillings
a week. When my time comes I shall go to the hospital.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>While Esther spoke Mrs. Barfield calculated roughly that about ten pounds
would meet most of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) wants. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) train fare, two month's board at seven
shillings a week, the room she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) would have to take near the hospital before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) confinement, and to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) would return with her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) baby--all these
would run to about four or five pounds. There would be baby's clothes to
buy... If she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) gave four pounds Esther would have then twelve pounds, and
with that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would be able to manage. Mrs. Barfield went over to an
old-fashioned escritoire, and, pulling out some small drawers, took from
one some paper packages which she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) unfolded. <div class="bookquote">``Now, my girl, look here. I'm
going to give you four pounds; then you will have twelve, and that ought
to see you through your trouble. You have been a good servant, Esther; I
like you very much, and am truly sorry to part with you. You will write
and tell me how you are getting on, and if one of these days you want a
place, and I have one to give you, I shall be glad to take you back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Harshness deadened and hardened her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) feelings, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) was easily moved by
kindness, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) longed to throw herself at her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) mistress's feet; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>)
nature did not admit of such effusion, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) said, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) blunt English
way--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are far too good, ma'am; I do not deserve such treatment--I know I
don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say no more, Esther. I hope that the Lord may give you strength to bear
your cross... Now go and pack up your box. But, Esther, do you feel your
sin, can you truly say honestly before God that you repent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am, I think I can say all that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, Esther, come and kneel down and pray to God to give you strength in
the future to stand against temptation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barfield/Barfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Barfield took Esther's hand and they knelt down by the round table,
leaning their hands on its edge. And, in a high, clear voice, Mrs.
Barfield prayed aloud, Esther repeating the words after her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Lord, Thou knowest all things, knowest how Thy servant has strayed
and has fallen into sin. But Thou hast said there is more joy in heaven
over one sinner that repenteth than over ninety and nine just men.
Therefore, Lord, kneeling here before Thee, we pray that this poor girl,
who repents of the evil she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has done, may be strengthened in Thy mercy to
stand firm against temptation. Forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sin, even as Thou forgavest the
woman of Samaria. Give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) strength to walk uprightly before Thee, and
give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) strength to bear the pain and the suffering that lie before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>The women rose from their knees and stood looking at each other. Esther's
eyes were full of tears. Without speaking she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) turned to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One word more, Esther. You asked me just now for a character; I
hesitated, but it seems to me now that it would be wrong to refuse. If I
did you might never get a place, and then it would be impossible to say
what might happen. I am not certain that I am doing right, but I know what
it means to refuse to give a servant a character, and I cannot take upon
myself the responsibility.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barfield/Barfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Barfield wrote out a character for Esther, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) described her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
as an honest, hard-working girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) paused at the word <div class="bookquote">``reliable,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and
wrote instead, <div class="bookquote">``I believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to be at heart a thoroughly religious girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) went upstairs to pack her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) box, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) came down she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) found all
the women in the kitchen; evidently they were waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). Coming
forward, Sarah said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope we shall part friends, Esther; any quarrels we may have
had--There's no ill-feeling now, is there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I bear no one any ill-feeling. We have been friends these last months;
indeed, everyone has been very kind to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>And Esther kissed Sarah on
both cheeks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure we're all sorry to lose you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Gale/Gale</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, pressing forward,
<div class="bookquote">``and we hope you'll write and let us know how you are getting on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Gale/Gale</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret, who was a tender-hearted girl, began to cry, and, kissing
Esther, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had never got on with a girl who slept in
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) room so well before. Esther shook hands with Grover, and then her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes
met Mrs. Latch's. The old woman took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It breaks my heart to think that one belonging to me should have done you
such a wrong--But if you want for anything let me know, and you shall have
it. You will want money; I have some here for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, thank you, but I have all I want. Mrs. Barfield has been very
good to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leopold</b></font>)</div><p/>The babbling of so many voices drew Mr. Leopold from the pantry; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) came
with a glass of beer in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) hand, and this suggested a toast to Sarah.
<div class="bookquote">``Let's drink baby's health,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Leopold won't refuse us the
beer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>The idea provoked some good-natured laughter, and Esther hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) face in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hands and tried to get away. But Margaret would not allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What
nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We don't think any the worse of you; why that's an
accident that might happen to any of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther.

<p/>The jug of beer was finished; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was kissed and hugged again, some tears
were shed, and Esther walked down the yard through the stables.

<p/>The avenue was full of wind and rain; the branches creaked dolefully
overhead; the lane was drenched, and the bare fields were fringed with
white mist, and the houses seemed very desolate by the bleak sea; and the
girl's soul was desolate as the landscape. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had come to Woodview to
escape the suffering of a home which had become unendurable, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
going back in circumstances a hundred times worse than those in which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
had left it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was going back with the memory of the happiness she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
had lost. All the grief and trouble that girls of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) class have so
frequently to bear gathered in Esther's heart when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looked out of the
railway carriage window and saw for the last time the stiff plantations on
the downs and the angles of the Italian house between the trees. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) drew
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) handkerchief from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) jacket, and hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) distress as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
could from the other occupants of the carriage.




<p/>XIII


<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) arrived at Victoria it was raining. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) picked up her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) skirt, and
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) stepped across a puddle a wild and watery wind swept up the wet
streets, catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) full in the face.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) box in the cloak-room, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not know if her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) father
would have her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) at home. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mother would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thought, but no
one could say for certain what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would do. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) brought the box he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
might fling it after her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) into the street; better come without it, even if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had to go back through the wet to fetch it. At that moment another
gust drove the rain violently over her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), forcing it through her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) boots. The
sky was a tint of ashen grey, and all the low brick buildings were veiled
in vapour; the rough roadway was full of pools, and nothing was heard but
the melancholy bell of the tram-car. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hesitated, not wishing to spend a
penny unnecessarily, but remembering that a penny wise is often a pound
foolish she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) called to the driver and got in. The car passed by the little
brick street where the Saunders lived, and when Esther pushed the door
open she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could see into the kitchen and overhear the voices of the
children. Mrs. Saunders was sweeping down the stairs, but at the sound of
footsteps she (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) ceased to bang the broom, and, stooping till her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) head looked
over the banisters, she (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) cried--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! You, Esther?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Saunders/Saunders</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Saunders hastened down, and, leaning the broom against the wall, she (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>)
took her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) daughter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) arms and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Well, this is nice to see
you again, after this long while. But you are looking a bit poorly,
Esther.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) face changed expression. <div class="bookquote">``What has happened? Have you
lost your situation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am that sorry, for we thought you was so `appy there and liked your
mistress above all those you `ad ever met with. Did you lose your temper
and answer her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) back? They is often trying, I know that, and your own
temper--you was never very sure of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've no fault to find with my mistress; she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) is the kindest in the
world--none better,--and my temper--it wasn't that, mother--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My own darling, tell me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther paused. The children had ceased talking in the kitchen, and the
front door was open. <div class="bookquote">``Come into the parlour. We can talk quietly there...
When do you expect father home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for the best part of a couple of hours yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Saunders/Saunders</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Saunders waited until Esther had closed the front door. Then they
went into the parlour and sat down side by side on the little horsehair
sofa placed against the wall facing the window. The anxiety in their
hearts betrayed itself on their faces.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had to leave, mother. I'm seven months gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Esther, Esther, I cannot believe it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mother, it is quite true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther hurried through her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) story, and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mother questioned her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
regarding details she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother, what does it matter? I don't care to talk about it more than
I can help.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Tears had begun to roll down Mrs. Saunders' cheeks, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) wiped
them away with the corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) apron, Esther heard a sob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't cry, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther. <div class="bookquote">``I have been very wicked, I know, but
God will be good to me. I always pray to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), just as you taught me to do,
and I daresay I shall get through my trouble somehow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father will never let you stop `ere; `e'll say, just as afore, that
there be too many mouths to feed as it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to keep me for nothing--I know well enough if I did that
`e'd put me outside quick enough. But I can pay my way. I earned good
money while I was with the Barfields, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) did tell me I must
go, Mrs. Barfield--the Saint they call her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) is a saint if ever
there was one--gave me four pounds to see me, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) said, through my
trouble. I've better than eleven pound. Don't cry, mother dear; crying
won't do no good, and I want you to help me. So long as the money holds
out I can get a lodging anywhere, but I'd like to be near you; and father
might be glad to let me have the parlour and my food for ten or eleven
shillings a week--I could afford as much as that, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) never was the man
to turn good money from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) door. Do yer think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dunno, dearie; `tis hard to say what `e'll do; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a `ard man to live
with. I've `ad a terrible time of it lately, and them babies allus coming.
Ah, we poor women have more than our right to bear with!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther, and, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mother's hand in hers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) closer, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I know what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was; is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) any worse now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drinks more, and is even rougher. It was only the other
day, just as I was attending to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dinner--it was a nice piece of steak,
and it looked so nice that I cut off a weany piece to taste. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sees me do
it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cries out, ``Now then, guts, what are you interfering with my
dinner for?'' I says, ``I only cut off a tiny piece to taste.'' ``Well, then,
taste that,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) says, and strikes me clean between the eyes. Ah, yes,
lucky for you to be in service; you've half forgot by now what we've to
put up with `ere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You was always that soft with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), mother; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never touched me since I
dashed the hot water in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes I thinks I can bear it no longer, Esther, and long to go and
drown meself. Jenny and Julia--you remember little Julia; she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) `as grown up
such a big girl, and is getting on so well--they are both at work now in
the kitchen. Johnnie gives us a deal of trouble; he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnnie</b></font>) cannot tell a word of
truth; father took off his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) strap the other day and beat him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dreadful, but
it ain't no use. If it wasn't for Jenny and Julia I don't think we should
ever make both ends meet; but they works all day at the dogs, and at the
warehouse their dogs is said to be neater and more lifelike than any
other. Their poor fingers is worn away cramming the paper into the moulds;
but they never complains, no more shouldn't I if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a bit gentler and
didn't take more than half of what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) earns to the public-`ouse. I was
glad you was away, Esther, for you allus was of an `asty temper and
couldn't `ave borne it. I don't want to make my troubles seem worse than
they be, but sometimes I think I will break up, `special when I get to
thinking what will become of us and all them children, money growing less
and expenses increasing. I haven't told yer, but I daresay you have
noticed that another one is coming. It is the children that breaks us poor
women down altogether. Ah, well, yours be the hardest trouble, but you
must put a brave face on it; we'll do the best we can; none of us can say
no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Saunders/Saunders</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Saunders wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) eyes with the corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) apron; Esther looked
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) usual quiet, stubborn stare, and without further words
mother and daughter went into the kitchen where the girls were at work. It
was a long, low room, with one window looking on a small back-yard, at the
back of which was the coal-hole, the dust-bin, and a small outhouse. There
was a long table and a bench ran along the wall. The fireplace was on the
left-hand side; the dresser stood against the opposite wall; and amid the
poor crockery, piled about in every available space, were the toy dogs,
some no larger than your hand, others almost as large as a small poodle.
Jenny and Julia had been working busily for some days, and were now
finishing the last few that remained of the order they had received from
the shop they worked for. Three small children sat on the floor tearing
the brown paper, which they handed as it was wanted to Jenny and Julia.
The big girls leaned over the table in front of iron moulds, filling them
with brown paper, pasting it down, tucking it in with strong and dexterous
fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it is Esther!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>said Jenny, the elder girl. <div class="bookquote">``And, lorks, ain't she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
grand!--quite the lady. Why, we hardly knowed ye.''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>And having kissed their
sister circumspectly, careful not to touch the clothes they admired with
their pasty fingers, they stood lost in contemplation, thrilled with
consciousness of the advantage of service.

<p/>Esther took Harry, a fine little boy of four, up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) arms, and asked
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Naw, I don't think I do. Will oo put me down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you do, Lizzie?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, addressing a girl of seven, whose bright
red hair shone like a lamp in the gathering twilight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you're my big sister; you've been away this year or more in
service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you, Maggie, do you remember me too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie at first seemed doubtful, but after a moment's reflection she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head vigorously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Esther, see how Julia is getting on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Saunders/Saunders</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Saunders; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)
makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) dogs nearly as fast as Jenny. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) is still a bit careless in
drawing the paper into the moulds. Well, just as I was speaking of it:
`ere's a dog with one shoulder just `arf the size of the other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Saunders/Saunders</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother, I'm sure nobody'd never know the difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Esther, just look at Julia's dog,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>cried Jenny, <div class="bookquote">'''e `asn't got no more

docked us maybe a shilling or more on the week's work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>Julia began to cry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jenny is always down on me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) is jealous just because mother said I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are all my dogs there on the right-hand side of the dresser--I

stuffs so much paper into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) dogs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ethel</b></font>)</div><p/>It was little Ethel speaking from her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) corner, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) explanation of the
excellence of Jenny's dogs, given with stolid childish gravity in the
interval of tearing a large sheet of brown paper, made them laugh. But in
the midst of the laughter thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) great trouble came upon Esther.
Mrs. Saunders noticed this, and a look of pity came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) eyes, and to
make an end of the unseemly gaiety she (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) took Julia's dog and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) that
it must be put into the mould again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) cut the skin away, and helped to
force the stiff paper over the edge of the mould.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it is a dog; both shoulders is equal, and if it was a

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, bother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>cried Jenny, <div class="bookquote">``I shan't be able to finish my last dozen this

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't they give yer any at the shop? I was counting on the money they

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, we can't get no buttons in the shop: that's `ome work, they says; and

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But `aven't you got sixpence, mother? and I'll run and get them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, `ave yer lost yer situation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Saunders/Saunders</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Saunders, <div class="bookquote">``Esther ain't well--she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) `as come up for `er

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Saunders/Saunders</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I go too?''  (<font color='red'><b>Julia</b></font>)</div>said Julia. <div class="bookquote">``I've been at work since eight, and I've only

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you may go with your sister. Run along; don't bother me any more,
I've got to get your father's supper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>When Jenny and Julia had left, Esther and Mrs. Saunders could talk freely;
the other children were too young to understand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is times when 'e is well enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Saunders/Saunders</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Saunders, ``and others
when 'e is that awful. It is `ard to know `ow to get him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), but 'e is to be

a-telling you of. Should you catch him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in that humour `e's as like as not

`e's as like as not to say, <div class="bookquote">``Well, my gal, make yerself at `ome.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) can but turn me out, I'll leave yer to speak to `im, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll do my best, but I don't answer for nothing. A nice bit of supper do

he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) clapt eyes on it and become that cheerful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, mother, if you think it will make a difference I can easily slip
round to the butcher's and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, get half a pound, and when it's nicely cooked and inside him (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) it'll

spending your money--money that you'll want badly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It can't be helped, mother. I shan't be above a minute or two away, and
I'll bring back a pint of porter with the steak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Coming back she (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) met Jenny and Julia, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) told them her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) purchases
they remarked significantly that they were now quite sure of a pleasant
evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>)'s done eating `e'll go out to smoke his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) pipe with some of his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>)
chaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>said Jenny, <div class="bookquote">``and we shall have the `ouse to ourselves, and yer can
tell us all about your situation. They keeps a butler and a footman, don't
they? They must be grand folk. And what was the footman like? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) very
handsome? I've `eard that they all is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you'll show us yer dresses, won't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Julia</b></font>)</div>said Julia. <div class="bookquote">``How many `ave
you got, and `ow did yer manage to save up enough money to buy such
beauties, if they're all like that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This dress was given to me by Miss Mary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it? She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must be a real good `un. I should like to go to service; I'm
tired of making dogs; we have to work that `ard, and it nearly all goes to
the public; father drinks worse than ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Saunders/Saunders</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Saunders approved of Esther's purchase; it was a beautiful bit of
steak. The fire was raked up, and a few minutes after the meat was
roasting on the gridiron. The clock continued its coarse ticking amid the
rough plates on the dresser. Jenny and Julia hastened with their work,
pressing the paper with nervous fingers into the moulds, calling sharply
to the little group for what sized paper they required. Esther and Mrs.
Saunders waited, full of apprehension, for the sound of a heavy tread in
the passage. At last it came. Mrs. Saunders turned the meat, hoping that
its savoury odour would greet his (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) nostrils from afar, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) would
come to them mollified and amiable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo, Jim; yer are `ome a bit earlier to-day. I'm not quite ready with
yer supper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dunno that I am. Hullo, Esther! Up for the day? Smells damned nice,
what you're cooking for me, missus. What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bit of steak, Jim. It seems a beautiful piece. Hope it will eat tender.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That it will. I was afeard you would have nothing more than a rasher, and
I'm that `ungry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jim</b></font>)</div><p/>Jim Saunders was a stout, dark man about forty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) had not shaved for some
days, his (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) face was black with beard; his (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) moustache was cut into bristle;
around his (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) short, bull neck he (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) wore a ragged comforter, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) blue
jacket was shabby and dusty, and the trousers were worn at the heels. He (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>)
threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) basket into a corner, and then himself on the rough bench nailed
against the wall, and there, without speaking another word, he (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) lay
sniffing the odour of the meat like an animal going to be fed. Suddenly a
whiff from the beer jug came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) nostrils, and reaching out his (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) rough
hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) looked into the jug to assure himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) was not mistaken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) exclaimed; <div class="bookquote">``a pint of porter! Yer are doing me pretty
well this evening, I reckon. What's up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, Jim; nothing, dear, but just as Esther has come up we thought
we'd try to make yer comfortable. It was Esther who fetched it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) `as
been doing pretty well, and can afford it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Story</b></font>)</div><p/>Jim looked at Esther in a sort of vague and brutal astonishment, and
feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) must say something, and not knowing well what, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, `ere's to your good health!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) took a long pull at the jug.
<div class="bookquote">``Where did you get this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In Durham street, at the `Angel.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I thought as much; they don't sell stuff like this at the ``Rose and
Crown.<div class="bookquote">'' Well, much obliged to yer. I shall enjoy my bit of steak now; and
I see a tater in the cinders. How are you getting on, old woman--is it
nearly done? Yer know I don't like all the goodness burnt out of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Rose Crown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't quite done yet, Jim; a few minutes more--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Story</b></font>)</div><p/>Jim sniffed in eager anticipation, and then addressed himself to Esther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, they seem to do yer pretty well down there. My word, what a toff
yer are! Quite a lady... There's nothing like service for a girl; I've
always said so. Eh, Jenny, wouldn't yer like to go into service, like yer
sister? Looks better, don't it, than making toy dogs at three-and-sixpence
the gross?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should just think it was. I wish I could. As soon as Maggie can take my
place, I mean to try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was the young lady of the `ouse that gave `er that nice dress,''  (<font color='red'><b>Julia</b></font>)</div>said
Julia. <div class="bookquote">``My eye! she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must have been a favourite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Saunders/Saunders</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment Mrs. Saunders picked the steak from the gridiron, and
putting it on a nice hot plate she (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) carried it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) apron to Jim, saying,
<div class="bookquote">``Mind yer `ands, it is burning `ot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Story</b></font>)</div><p/>Jim fed in hungry silence, the children watching, regretting that none of
them ever had suppers like that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) didn't speak until he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had put away the
better part of the steak; then, after taking a long pull at the jug of
beer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I `aven't enjoyed a bit of food like that this many a day; I was that
beat when I came in, and it does do one good to put a piece of honest meat
into one's stomach after a `ard day's work!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, prompted by a sudden thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) complimented Esther on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looks,
and then, with increasing interest, inquired what kind of people she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was
staying with. But Esther was in no humour for conversation, and answered
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) questions briefly without entering into details. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) reserve only
increased his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) curiosity, which fired up at the first mention of the
race-horses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I scarcely know much about them. I only used to see them passing through
the yard as they went to exercise on the downs. There was always a lot of
talk about them in the servants' hall, but I didn't notice it. They were a
great trouble to Mrs. Barfield--I told you, mother, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) was one of
ourselves, didn't I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Story</b></font>)</div><p/>A look of contempt passed over Jim's face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've quite enough talk `ere about the Brethren; give them a rest. What
about the `orses? Did they win any races? Yer can't `ave missed `earing
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Silver Braid won the Stewards' Cup.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Silver Braid was one of your horses?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. Barfield won thousands and thousands, everyone in Shoreham won
something, and a ball for the servants was given in the Gardens.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you never thought of writing to me about it! I could have `ad thirty
to one off Bill Short. One pound ten to a bob! And yer never thought it
worth while to send me the tip. I'm blowed! Girls aren't worth a damn...
Thirty to one off Bill Short--he (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>)'d have laid it. I remember seeing the
price quoted in all the papers. Thirty to one taken and hoffered. If you
had told me all yer knowed I might `ave gone `alf a quid--fifteen pun to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I `eard that he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was entered for the Cambridgeshire, but if I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes; I know; after the Baron. Now what do 'e say? I reckon 'e knows.

 (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Story</b></font>)</div><p/>Jim chuckled. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think I know what kind of man your Mr. Leopold is

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) only laughed a little once, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) didn't think the `orse would

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Handicaps?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's it. But there's no relying on what Mr. Leopold says--he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) never

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you stopping for? What did yer `ear `im say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) intends to have something on next spring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) say any race? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) say the City and Sub.?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that was the race he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mentioned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought that would be about the length and the breadth of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Story</b></font>)</div>Jim
said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) knife and fork. There was only a small portion of
the beef-steak left, and this he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) ate gluttonously, and, finishing the last
remaining beer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) leaned back in the happiness of repletion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) crammed
tobacco into a dirty clay, with a dirtier finger-nail, and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd be uncommon glad to `ear how he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) is getting on. When are you going
back? Up for the day only?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther did not answer, and Jim looked inquiringly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) reached across the
table for the matches. The decisive moment had arrived, and Mrs. Saunders
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Esther ain't a-going back; leastways--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Saunders/Saunders</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not going back! You don't mean that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) ain't contented in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Saunders/Saunders</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Esther ain't going back no more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Saunders/Saunders</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Saunders answered, incautiously.
<div class="bookquote">``Look ee `ere, Jim--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Out with it, old woman--no `umbug! What is it all about? Ain't going back
to `er sitooation, and where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) `as been treated like that--just look at
the duds she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) `as got on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The evening was darkening rapidly, and the firelight flickered over the
back of the toy dogs piled up on the dresser. Jim had lit his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) pipe, and
the acrid and warm odour of quickly-burning tobacco overpowered the smell
of grease and the burnt skin of the baked potato, a fragment of which
remained on the plate; only the sickly flavour of drying paste was
distinguishable in the reek of the short black clay which the man held
firmly between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth. Esther sat by the fire, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hands crossed over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knees, no signs of emotion on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sullen, plump face. Mrs. Saunders
stood on the other side of Esther, between her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) and the younger children,
now quarrelling among themselves, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) face was full of fear as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) husband anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, then, old woman, blurt it out!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What is it? Can it be the
girl `as lost her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sitooation--got the sack? Yes, I see that's about the

country any more than I could mesel'. Well, it's `er own look-out! If she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
can afford to chuck up a place like that, so much the better for `er.
Pity, though; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might `ave put me up to many a good thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It ain't that, Jim. The girl is in trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wot do yer say? Esther in trouble? Well, that's the best bit I've heard

wouldn't `ave nothing to do with such as was Mrs. Dunbar `as got `erself

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Jim, dear, yer mustn't be `ard on `er; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dunbar</b></font>) could tell a very

like a block of marble, and won't as much as say a word in `er own
defence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't want `er to speak. I don't care, it's nothing to me; I only
laughed because--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jim, dear, it is something to all of us. What we thought was that you

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that's it, is it? That was the meaning of the `alf-pound of steak and

blowed if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dunbar</b></font>) do! A nice thing, too; a girl can't go away to service
without coming back to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) respectable `ome in trouble--in trouble, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>Jenny and Julia looked curiously at Esther, who sat quite still, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) face
showing no sign of emotion. Mrs. Saunders turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>), a pitying
look on her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) face, saying clearly, <div class="bookquote">``You see, my poor girl, how matters
stand; I can do nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl, although she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not raise her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes, understood what was passing
in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother's mind, for there was a grave deliberativeness in the manner
in which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rose from the chair.

<p/>But just as the daughter had guessed what was passing in the mother's
mind, so did the mother guess what was passing in the daughter's. Mrs.
Saunders threw herself before Esther, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, Esther, wait a
moment; 'e won't be `ard on `ee.''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Then turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) husband, <div class="bookquote">``Yer don't
understand, Jim. It is only for a little time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband Yer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I tell yer. No, I won't `ave it! There be too many `ere as it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only a little while, Jim.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. And those who ain't wanted `ad better go at once--that's my advice to
them. The place is as full of us that we can `ardly turn round as it is.
No, I won't `ear of it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Jim, Esther is quite willing to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) way; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)'s saved a good
little sum of money, and could afford to pay us ten shillings a week for
board and the parlour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Story</b></font>)</div><p/>A perplexed look came on Jim's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't yer tell me that afore? Of course I don't wish to be `ard on
the girl, as yer `ave just heard me say. Ten shillings a week for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
board and the parlour--that seems fair enough; and if it's any convenience
to `er to remain, I'm sure we'll be glad to `ave `er. I'll say right glad,
too. We was always good friends, Esther, wasn't we, though ye wasn't one
of my own?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Story</b></font>)</div>So saying, Jim held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) hand.

<p/>Esther tried to pass by her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to stop where I'm not
wanted; I wants no one's charity. Let me go, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No, no, Esther. <div class="bookquote">``Aven't yer `eard what 'e says? Ye are my child if you
ain't `is, and it would break my `eart, that it would, to see you go away
among strangers. Yer place is among yer own people, who'll look after
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, then, Esther, why should there be ill feeling. I didn't mean any
`arm. There's a lot of us `ere, and I've to think of the interests of my
own. But for all that I should be main sorry to see yer take yer money
among strangers, where you wouldn't get no value for it. You'd better
stop. I'm sorry for what I said. Ain't that enough for yer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jim, Jim, dear, don't say no more; leave `er to me. Esther, for my sake
stop with us. You are in trouble, and it is right for you to stop with me.
Jim `as said no more than the truth. With all the best will in the world
we couldn't afford to keep yer for nothing, but since yer can pay yer way,
it is yer duty to stop. Think, Esther, dear, think. Go and shake `ands
with `im, and I'll go and make yer up a bed on the sofa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no bloody need for `er to shake my `and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) don't like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Story</b></font>)</div>Jim
replied, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) pulled doggedly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) pipe.

<p/>Esther tried, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) fierce and heavy temper held her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) couldn't
go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) father for reconciliation, and the matter might have ended quite
differently, but suddenly, without another word, Jim put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) hat and
went out to join <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) chaps''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Story</b></font>)</div>who were waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) about the
public-house, close to the cab-rank in the Vauxhall Bridge Road. The door
was hardly closed behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) when the young children laughed and ran about
joyously, and Jenny and Julia went over to Esther and begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to stop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)'ll stop,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Saunders/Saunders</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Saunders. <div class="bookquote">``And now, Esther, come along
and help me to make you up a bed in the parlour.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>XIV


<p/>Esther was fast asleep next morning when Mrs. Saunders came into the
parlour. Mrs. Saunders stood looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>), and Esther turned suddenly on
the sofa and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What time is it, mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's gone six; but don't you get up. You're your own mistress whilst
you're here; you pays for what you `as.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't afford them lazy habits. There's plenty of work here, and I must
help you with some of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Plenty of work here, that's right enough. But why should you bother, and
you nearly seven months gone? I daresay you feels that `eavy that you
never care to get out of your chair. But they says that them who works up
to the last `as the easiest time in the end. Not that I've found it so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The conversation paused. Esther threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) legs over the side of the sofa,
and still wrapped in the blanket, sat looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't be over-comfortable on that bit of sofa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Saunders/Saunders</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Saunders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lor, I can manage right enough, if that was all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You is that cast down, Esther; you mustn't give way. Things sometimes
turns out better than one expects.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You never found they did, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I didn't, but that says nothing for others. We must bear up as
best we can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>One word led to another, and very soon Esther was telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mother the
whole tale of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) misfortune--all about William, the sweepstakes, the ball
at the Shoreham Gardens, the walks about the farm and hillside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Service is no place for a girl who wants to live as we used to live when
father was alive--no service that I've seen. I see that plain enough.
Mistress was one of the Brethren like ourselves, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>) had to put up
with betting and drinking and dancing, and never a thought of the Lord.
There was no standing out against it. They call you Creeping Jesus if you
say your prayers, and you can't say them with a girl laughing or singing
behind your back, so you think you'll say them to yourself in bed, but
sleep comes sooner than you expect, and so you slips out of the habit.
Then the drinking. We was brought up teetotal, but they're always pressing
it upon you, and to please him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) I said I would drink the `orse's `ealth.
That's how it began... You don't know what it is, mother; you only knew
God-fearing men until you married him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>). We aren't all good like you,
mother. But I thought no harm, indeed I didn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A girl can't know what a man is thinking of, and we takes the worst for
the best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't say that I was altogether blameless but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was that bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther hesitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was like other men. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told me--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) promised me he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d marry
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Saunders/Saunders</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Saunders did not answer, and Esther said, <div class="bookquote">``You don't believe I'm
speaking the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do, dearie. I was only thinking. You're my daughter; no mother had
a better daughter. There never was a better girl in this world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was telling you, mother--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Saunders/Saunders</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't want no telling that my Esther ain't a bad girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Saunders/Saunders</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Saunders sat nodding her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) head, a sweet, uncritical mother; and Esther
understood how unselfishly her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mother loved her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and how simply she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
thought of how she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might help her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) trouble. Neither spoke, and
Esther continued dressing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You `aven't told me what you think of your room. It looks pretty, don't
you think? I keeps it as nice as I can. Jenny hung up them pictures. They
livens it up a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, pointing to the coloured supplements, from
the illustrated papers, on the wall. <div class="bookquote">``The china shepherd and shepherdess,
you know; they was at Barnstaple.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>When Esther was dressed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) and Mrs. Saunders knelt down and said a
prayer together. Then Esther said she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) room, and when
that was done she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) insisted on helping her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mother with the housework.

<p/>In the afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sisters, helping them with their dogs,
folding the paper into the moulds, pasting it down, or cutting the skins
into the requisite sizes. About five, when the children had had their tea,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mother went for a short walk. Very often they strolled through
Victoria Station, amused by the bustle of the traffic, or maybe they
wandered down the Buckingham Palace Road, attracted by the shops. And
there was a sad pleasure in these walks. The elder woman had borne years
of exceeding trouble, and felt her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) strength failing under her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) burdens,
which instead of lightening were increasing; the younger woman was full of
nervous apprehension for the future and grief for the past. But they loved
each other deeply. Esther threw herself in the way to protect her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mother,
whether at a dangerous crossing or from the heedlessness of the crowd at a
corner, and often a passer-by turned his (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) head and looked after them,
attracted by the solicitude which the younger woman showed for the elder.
In those walks very little was said. They walked in silence, slipping now
and then into occasional speech, and here and there a casual allusion or a
broken sentence would indicate what was passing in their minds.

<p/>One day some flannel and shirts in a window caught Mrs. Saunder's eye, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is time, Esther, you thought about your baby clothes. One must be
prepared; one never knows if one will go one's full time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The words came upon Esther with something of a shock, helping her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to
realise the imminence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) trouble.

<p/>``You must have something by you, dear; one never knows how it is going to
turn out; even I who have been through it do feel that nervous. I looks
round the kitchen when I'm taken with the pains, and I says, <div class="bookquote">``I may never
see this room again.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>The words were said in an undertone to Esther, and the shop-woman turned
to get down the ready-made things which Mrs. Saunders had asked to see.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the shopwoman, <div class="bookquote">``is the gown, longcloth, one-and-sixpence;
here is the flannel, one-and-sixpence; and here is the little shirt,
sixpence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must have these to go on with, dear, and if the baby lives you'll
want another set.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother, of course he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll live; why shouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Saunders/Saunders</b></font>)</div><p/>Even the shopwoman smiled, and Mrs. Saunders, addressing the shopwoman,
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Them that knows nothing about it is allus full of `ope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Saunders/Saunders</b></font>)</div><p/>The shopwoman raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) eyes, sighed, and inquired sympathetically if
this was the young lady's first confinement.

<p/>Mrs. Saunders nodded and sighed, and then the shopwoman asked Mrs.
Saunders if she (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) required any baby clothes. Mrs. Saunders said she (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) had all
she (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) required. The parcel was made up, and they were preparing to leave,
when Esther said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I may as well buy the material and make another set--it will give me
something to do in the afternoons. I think I should like to make them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have some first-rate longcloth at sixpence-half-penny a yard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You might take three yards, Esther; if anything should happen to yer
bairn it will always come in useful. And you had better take three yards
of flannel. How much is yer flannel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have some excellent flannel,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, lifting down a long,
heavy package in dull yellow paper; <div class="bookquote">``this is ten-pence a yard. You will
want a finer longcloth for the little shirts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>And every afternoon Esther sat in the parlour by the window, seeing, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes from the sewing, the low brick street full of
children, and hearing the working women calling from the open doors or
windows; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) worked at the baby clothes, never perhaps to be worn,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heart sank at the long prospect that awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), the end of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
could not see, for it seemed to reach to the very end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) life. In
these hours she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) realised in some measure the duties that life held in
store, and it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) that they exceeded her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) strength. Never would
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) be able to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) up--he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would have no one to look to but her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
never imagined other than that her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) child would be a boy. The task was
clearly more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could perform, and in despair she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thought it would
be better for it to die. What would happen if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) remained out of a
situation? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) father would not have her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) at home, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knew well
enough. What should she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) do, and the life of another depending on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
would never see William again--that was certain. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had married a lady,
and, were they to meet, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would not look at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) temper grew hot, and
the memory of the injustice of which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been a victim pressed upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). But when vain anger passed away she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) baby, anticipating
the joy she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would experience when he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) held out tiny hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and that,
too, which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would feel when he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) laid an innocent cheek to hers; and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
dream persisting, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) learning a trade, going to work in the
morning and coming back to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in the evening, proud in the accomplishment
of something done, of good money honestly earned.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought a great deal, too, of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) poor mother, who was looking
strangely weak and poorly, and whose condition was rendered worse by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
nervous fears that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would not get through this confinement. For the
doctor had told Mrs. Saunders that the next time it might go hard with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>); and in this house, her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) husband growing more reckless and drunken, it
was altogether a bad look-out, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) might die for want of a little
nourishment or a little care. Unfortunately they would both be down at the
same time, and it was almost impossible that Esther should be well in time
to look after her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mother. That brute! It was wrong to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) father
so, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seemed to be without mercy for any of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had come in
yesterday half-boozed, having kept back part of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) money--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had come in
tramping and hiccuping.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, then, old girl, out with it! I must have a few halfpence; my chaps
is waiting for me, and I can't be looking down their mouths with nothing
in my pockets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only have a few halfpence to get the children a bit of dinner; if I
give them to you they'll have nothing to eat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the children can eat anything; I want beer. If yer `aven't money,
make it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Saunders/Saunders</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Saunders said that if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had any spare clothes she (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) would take them
round the corner. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) only answered--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if I `aven't a spare waistcoat left just take some of yer own
things. I tell yer I want beer, and I mean to have some.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fist raised, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) poor wife, ordering her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to take
one of the sheets from the bed and <div class="bookquote">``make money,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and would have struck her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
if Esther had not come between them and, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hand in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) pocket,
said, <div class="bookquote">``Be quiet, father; I'll give you the money you want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had done the same before, and, if needs be, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would do so again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
could not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mother struck, perhaps killed by that brute; her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) first
duty was to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mother, but these constant demands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) little
savings filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) with terror. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would want every penny; the ten
shillings he (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had already had from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) might be the very sum required to
put her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) feet again, and send her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) in search of a situation where she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
would be able to earn money for the boy. But if this extortion continued
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would do, and that night she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) prayed that God
might not delay the birth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) child.




<p/>XV


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish, mother, you was going to the hospital with me; it would save a
lot of expense and you'd be better cared for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>XV</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd like to be with you, dearie, but I can't leave my `ome, all these
young children about and no one to give an order. I must stop where I am.
But I've been intending to tell you--it is time that you was thinking
about yer letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What letter, mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They don't take you without a letter from one of the subscribers. If I
was you, now that the weather is fine and you have strength for the walk,
I'd go up to Queen Charlotte's. It is up the Edgware Road way, I think.
What do you think about to-morrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow's Sunday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That makes no matter, them horspitals is open.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go to-morrow when we have washed up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>On Friday Esther had had to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) father more money for drink. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) gave
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) two shillings, and that made a sovereign that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had had from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). On
Saturday night he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been brought home helplessly drunk long after
midnight, and next morning one of the girls had to fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a drop of
something to pull him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) together. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had lain in bed until dinner-time,
swearing he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would brain anyone who made the least noise. Even the Sunday
dinner, a nice beef-steak pudding, hardly tempted him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) left the
table saying that if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could find Tom Carter they would take a penny boat
and go for a blow on the river. The whole family waited for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) departure.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lingered, talked inconsequently, and several times Mrs. Saunders
and the children gave up hope. Esther sat without a word. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) a
sulky brute, and, snatching up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hat, left the house. The moment he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was
gone the children began to chatter like birds. Esther put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hat and
jacket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, take care of yourself. Good luck to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther smiled sadly. But the beautiful weather melted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) lips, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
lungs swelled with the warm air, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) noticed the sparrow that flew
across the cab rank, and saw the black dot pass down a mews and disappear
under the eaves. It was a warm day in the middle of April, a mist of green
had begun in the branches of the elms of the Green Park; and in Park Lane,
in all the balconies and gardens, wherever nature could find roothold, a
spray of gentle green met the eye. There was music, too, in the air, the
sound of fifes and drums, and all along the roadway as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) could
see the rapid movement of assembling crowds. A procession with banners was
turning the corner of the Edgware Road, and the policeman had stopped the
traffic to allow it to pass. The principal banner blew out blue and gold
in the wind, and the men that bore the poles walked with strained backs
under the weight; the music changed, opinions about the objects of the
demonstration were exchanged, and it was some time before Esther could
gain the policeman's attention. At last the conductor rang his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) bell, the
omnibus started, and gathering courage she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) asked the way. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
that every one was noticing her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and fearing to be overheard she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) spoke so
low that the policeman understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to say Charlotte Street. At that
moment an omnibus drew up close beside them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charlotte Street, Charlotte Street,''  (<font color='red'><b>the policeman</b></font>)</div>said the policeman, <div class="bookquote">``there's
Charlotte Street, Bloomsbury.''  (<font color='red'><b>the policeman</b></font>)</div>Before Esther could answer he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) had turned to
the conductor. <div class="bookquote">``You don't know any Charlotte Street about here, do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't. But can't yer see that it ain't no Charlotte Street she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
wants, but Queen Charlotte's Hospital? And ye'd better lose no time in
directing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>A roar of coarse laughter greeted this pleasantry, and burning with shame
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hurried down the Edgware Road. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had not gone far before she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had
to ask again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) scanned the passers-by seeking some respectable
woman, or in default an innocent child.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) came at last to an ugly desert place. There was the hospital, square,
forbidding; and opposite a tall, lean building with long grey columns.
Esther rang, and the great door, some fifteen feet high, was opened by a
small boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to see the secretary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you come this way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was shown into a waiting-room, and while waiting she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looked at the
religious prints on the walls. A lad of fifteen or sixteen came in. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You want to see the secretary?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I'm afraid you can't see him (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>)'s out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have come a long way; is there no one else I can see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you can see me--I'm his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) clerk. Have you come to be confined?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther answered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy, <div class="bookquote">``you are not in labour; we never take anyone in
before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not expect to be confined for another month. I came to make
arrangements.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got a letter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you must get a letter from one of the subscribers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do not know any.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can have a book of their names and addresses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I know no one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't know them. You can go and call. Take those that live
nearest--that's the way it is done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then will you give me the book?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go and get one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy returned a moment after with a small book, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) demanded a
shilling. Since she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had come to London her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hand had never been out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
pocket. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) money with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not dare leave it at home on
account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) father. The clerk looked out the addresses for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
tried to remember them--two were in Cumberland Place, another was in
Bryanstone Square. In Cumberland Place she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was received by an elderly lady
who said she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not wish to judge anyone, but it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) invariable
practice to give letters only to married women. There was a delicate smell
of perfume in the room; the lady stirred the fire and lay back in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
armchair. Once or twice Esther tried to withdraw, but the lady, although
unswervingly faithful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) principles, seemed not indifferent to
Esther's story, and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) many questions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see what interest all that can be to you, as you ain't going to
give me a letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther answered.

<p/>The next house she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) called at the lady was not at home, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was
expected back presently, and the maid servant asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to take a seat in
the hall. But when Esther refused information about her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) troubles she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was
called a stuck-up thing who deserved all she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) got, and was told there was
no use her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) waiting. At the next place she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was received by a footman who
insisted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) communicating her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) business to him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) would
see if his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) master was in. He (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) wasn't in; he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) must have just gone out. The
best time to find him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) was before half-past ten in the morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll be sure to do all he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) can for you--he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) always do for the good-looking
ones. How did it all happen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What business is that of yours? I don't ask your business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you needn't turn that rusty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment the master entered. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) asked Esther to come into his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) study.
He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was a tall, youngish-looking man of three or four-and-thirty, with
bright eyes and hair, and there was in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) voice and manner a kindness
that impressed Esther. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wished, however, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had seen his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) mother
instead of him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was more than ever ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) condition. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
seemed genuinely sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and regretted that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had given all his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
tickets away. Then a thought struck him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) wrote a letter to one of
his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) friends, a banker in Lincoln's Inn Fields. This gentleman, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said,
was a large subscriber to the hospital, and would certainly give her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) the
letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) required. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hoped that Esther would get through her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) trouble
all right.

<p/>The visit brought a little comfort into the girl's heart; and thinking of
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) kind eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) walked slowly, inquiring out her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) way until she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) got back
to the Marble Arch, and stood looking down the long Bayswater Road. The
lamps were beginning in the light, and the tall houses towered above the
sunset. Esther watched the spectral city, and some sensation of the poetry
of the hour must have stolen into her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heart, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) turned into the Park,
choosing to walk there. Upon its dim green grey the scattered crowds were
like strips of black tape. Here and there by the railings the tape had
been wound up in a black ball, and the peg was some democratic orator,
promising poor human nature unconditional deliverance from evil. Further
on were heard sounds from a harmonium, and hymns were being sung, and in
each doubting face there was something of the perplexing, haunting look
which the city wore.

<p/>A chill wind was blowing. Winter had returned with the night, but the
instinct of spring continued in the branches. The deep, sweet scent of the
hyacinth floated along the railings, and the lovers that sat with their
arms about each other on every seat were of Esther's own class. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would
have liked to have called them round her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) and told them her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) miserable
story, so that they might profit by her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) experience.




<p/>XVI


<p/>No more than three weeks now remained between her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) and the dreaded day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
had hoped to spend them with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mother, who was timorous and desponding,
and stood in need of consolation. But this was not to be; her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) father's
drunkenness continued, and daily he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) became more extortionate in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
demands for money. Esther had not six pounds left, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
must leave. It had come to this, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) doubted if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) were to stay on
that the clothes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) back might not be taken from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). Mrs. Saunders
was of the same opinion, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) urged Esther to go. But scruples
restrained her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't bring myself to leave you, mother; something tells me I should
stay with you. It is dreadful to be parted from you. I wish you was coming
to the hospital; you'd be far safer there than at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that, dearie; but where's the good in talking about it? It only
makes it harder to bear. You know I can't leave. It is terrible hard, as
you says.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Saunders/Saunders</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Saunders held her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) apron to her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) eyes and cried. <div class="bookquote">``You have
always been a good girl, never a better--my one consolation since your
poor father died.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't cry, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther; <div class="bookquote">``the Lord will watch over us, and we
shall both pray for each other. In about a month, dear, we shall be both
quite well, and you'll bless my baby, and I shall think of the time when I
shall put him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) into your arms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so, Esther; I hope so, but I am full of fears. I'm sore afraid
that we shall never see one another again--leastways on this earth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother, dear, yer mustn't talk like that; you'll break my heart, that
you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>The cab that took Esther to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) lodging cost half-a-crown, and this waste
of money frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thrifty nature, inherited through centuries of
working folk. The waste, however, had ceased at last, and it was none too
soon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thought, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sat in the room she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had taken near the hospital,
in a little eight-roomed house, kept by an old woman whose son was a
bricklayer.

<p/>It was at the end of the week, one afternoon, as Esther was sitting alone
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) room, that there came within her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) a great and sudden shock--life
seemed to be slipping from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sat for some minutes quite unable
to move. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) time had come, and when the pain ceased she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
went downstairs to consult Mrs. Jones.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hadn't I better go to the hospital now, Mrs. Jones?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not just yet, my dear; them is but the first labour pains; plenty of time
to think of the hospital; we shall see how you are in a couple of hours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will it last so long as that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll be lucky if you get it over before midnight. I have been down for
longer than that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mind my stopping in the kitchen with you? I feel frightened when
I'm alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'll be glad of your company. I'll get you some tea presently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could not touch anything. Oh, this is dreadful!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) exclaimed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
walked to and fro holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sides, balancing herself dolefully. Often
Mrs. Jones stopped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) work about the range and said, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``I know what it is, I have been through it many a time--we all must--it is
our earthly lot.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>About seven o'clock Esther was clinging to the table,
and with pain so vivid on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) face that Mrs. Jones laid aside the sausages
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) was cooking and approached the suffering girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! is it so bad as all that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I think I'm dying, I cannot stand up; give me a chair,
give me a chair!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) sank down upon it, leaning across the table, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)
face and neck bathed in a cold sweat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``John will have to get his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) supper himself; I'll leave these sausages on
the hob, and run upstairs and put on my bonnet. The things you intend to
bring with you, the baby clothes, are made up in a bundle, aren't they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jones</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Mrs. Jones came running down; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) threw a shawl over Esther, and it
was astonishing what support she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) lent to the suffering girl, calling on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) the whole time to lean on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) and not to be afraid. <div class="bookquote">``Now then, dear,
you must keep your heart up, we have only a few yards further to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are too good, you are too kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) leaned against
the wall, and Mrs. Jones rang the bell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep up your spirits; to-morrow it will be all over. I will come round
and see how you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The door opened. The porter rang the bell, and a sister came running down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, take my arm,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and breathe hard as you are
ascending the stairs. Come along, you mustn't loiter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>On the second landing a door was thrown open, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) found herself in a
room full of people, eight or nine young men and women.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! in there? and all those people?''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course; those are the midwives and the students.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) saw that the screams she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had heard in the passage came from a bed on
the left-hand side. A woman lay there huddled up. In the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
terror Esther was taken behind a screen by the sister who had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
upstairs and quickly undressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was clothed in a chemise a great deal
too big for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and a jacket which was also many sizes too large. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
remembered hearing the sister say so at the time. Both windows were wide
open, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) walked across the room she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) noticed the basins on the
floor, the lamp on the round table, and the glint of steel instruments.

<p/>The students and the nurses were behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knew they were eating
sweets, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heard a young man ask the young women if they would have
any more fondants. Their chatter and laughter jarred on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) nerves; but at
that moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) pains began again and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) saw the young man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had
seen handing the sweets approaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) bedside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, not him (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>), not him (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) cried to the nurse. <div class="bookquote">``Not him (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>), not him (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>)
is too young! Do not let him (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) come near me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>They laughed loudly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) head in the pillow, overcome with
pain and shame; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) felt him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) tried to rise from the
bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me go! take me away! Oh, you are all beasts!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, no nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>said the nurse; <div class="bookquote">``you can't have what you like;
they are here to learn;''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had tried the pains she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) heard the
midwife say that it wasn't necessary to send for the doctor. Another said
that it would be all over in about three hours' time. <div class="bookquote">``An easy
confinement, I should say. The other will be more interesting...''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then
they talked of the plays they had seen, and those they wished to see. A
discussion arose regarding the merits of a shilling novel which every one
was reading, and then Esther heard a stampede of nurses, midwives, and
students in the direction of the window. A German band had come into the
street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that the way to leave your patient, sister?''  (<font color='red'><b>the student boy</b></font>)</div>said the student who sat
by Esther's bed, a good-looking boy with a fair, plump face. Esther looked
into his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) clear blue, girl-like eyes, wondered, and turned away for shame.

<p/>The sister stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) imitation of a popular comedian, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh,
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s all right; if they were all like her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) there'd be very little use our
coming here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a comedian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unfortunately that's just what they are,''  (<font color='red'><b>another student fellow ends</b></font>)</div>said another student, a stout
fellow with a pointed red beard, the ends of which caught the light.
Esther's eyes often went to those stubble ends, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hated him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>)
loud voice and jocularity. One of the midwives, a woman with a long nose
and small grey eyes, seemed to mock her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and Esther hoped that this woman
would not come near her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) touch. There
was something sinister in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) face, and Esther was glad when her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
favourite, a little blond woman with wavy flaxen hair, came and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) felt better. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looked a little like the young student who still
sat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) bedside, and Esther wondered if they were brother and sister,
and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thought that they were sweethearts.

<p/>Soon after a bell rang, and the students went down to supper, the nurse in
charge promising to warn them if any change should take place. The last
pains had so thoroughly exhausted her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had fallen into a doze. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) could hear the chatter of the nurses so clearly that she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) did not
believe herself asleep. And in this film of sleep reality was distorted,
and the unsuccessful operation which the nurses were discussing Esther
understood to be a conspiracy against her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) awoke, listened, and
gradually sense of the truth returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was in the hospital...
The nurses were talking of some one who had died last week... That poor
woman in the other bed seemed to suffer dreadfully. Would she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) live through
it? Would she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) herself live to see the morning? How long the time, how
fearful the place! If the nurses would only stop talking... The pains
would soon begin again... It was awful to lie listening, waiting. The
windows were open, and the mocking gaiety of the street was borne in on
the night wind. Then there came a trampling of feet and sound of voices in
the passage--the students and nurses were coming up from supper; and at
the same moment the pains began to creep up from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knees. One of the
young men said that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) time had not come. The woman with the sinister
look that Esther dreaded, held a contrary opinion. The point was argued,
and, interested in the question, the crowd came from the window and
collected round the disputants. The young man expounded much medical and
anatomical knowledge; the nurses listened with the usual deference of
women.

<p/>Suddenly the discussion was interrupted by a scream from Esther; it seemed
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was being torn asunder, that life was going from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). The
nurse ran to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) side, a look of triumph came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) face, and she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``Now we shall see who's right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and forthwith ran for the doctor. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) came
running up the stairs; immediately silence and scientific collectedness
gathered round Esther, and after a brief examination he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said, in a low
whisper--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid this will not be as easy a case as one might have imagined. I
shall administer chloroform.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) placed a small wire case over her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mouth and nose, and the sickly odour
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) breathed from the cotton wool filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) brain with nausea; it
seemed to choke her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and then life faded, and at every inhalation she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
expected to lose sight of the circle of faces.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes the doctors and nurses were still standing round
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), but there was no longer any expression of eager interest on their
faces. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wondered at this change, and then out of the silence there came
a tiny cry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's your baby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My baby! Let me see it; is it a boy or a girl?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a boy; it will be given to you when we get you out of the labour
ward.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew it would be a boy.''  (<font color='red'><b>a scream</b></font>)</div>Then a scream of pain rent the stillness of
the room. <div class="bookquote">``Is that the same woman who was here when I first came in?
Hasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) been confined yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, and I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will be till midday; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s very bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>The door was thrown open, and Esther was wheeled into the passage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was
like a convalescent plant trying to lift its leaves to the strengthening
light, but within this twilight of nature the thought of another life, now
in the world, grew momentarily more distinct. <div class="bookquote">``Where is my boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said;
<div class="bookquote">``give him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The nurse entered, and answered, <div class="bookquote">``Here.''  (<font color='red'><b>The nurse</b></font>)</div>A pulp of red flesh rolled up in
flannel was laid alongside of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). Its eyes were open; it looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>),
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) flesh filled with a sense of happiness so deep and so intense that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was like one enchanted. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) took the child in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) arms she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) must die of happiness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not hear the nurse speak, nor
did she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) took the babe from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) arms and laid it
alongside on the pillow, saying, <div class="bookquote">``You must let the little thing sleep, you
must try to sleep yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the babe</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) personal self seemed entirely withdrawn; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) existed like an
atmosphere about the babe, an impersonal emanation of love. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) lay
absorbed in this life of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) life, this flesh of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) flesh, unconscious of
herself as a sponge in warm sea-water. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) touched this pulp of life, and
was thrilled, and once more her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) senses swooned with love; it was still
there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) remembered that the nurse had said it was a boy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) must see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) boy, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hands, working as in a dream, unwound him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and, delirious
with love, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) gazed until he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) awoke and cried. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) tried to hush him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and
to enfold him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), but her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) strength failed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not help him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and fear
came lest he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) should die. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) strove to reach her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hands to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), but all
strength had gone from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cries sounded hollow in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) weak
brain. Then the nurse came and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See what you have done, the poor child is all uncovered; no wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is
crying. I will wrap him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) up, and you must not interfere with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>But as soon as the nurse turned away Esther had her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) child back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
arms. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not sleep. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not sleep for thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and the
long night passed in adoration.




<p/>XVII


<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was happy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) babe lay beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). All her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) joints were loosened, and
the long hospital days passed in gentle weariness. Lady visitors came and
asked questions. Esther said that her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) father and mother lived in the
Vauxhall Bridge Road, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) admitted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had saved four pounds.
There were two beds in this ward, and the woman who occupied the second
bed declared herself to be destitute, without home, or money, or friends.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) secured all sympathy and promises of help, and Esther was looked upon
as a person who did not need assistance and ought to have known better.
They received visits from a clergyman. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) spoke to Esther of God's
goodness and wisdom, but his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) exhortations seemed a little remote, and
Esther was sad and ashamed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was not more deeply stirred. Had it
been her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) own people who came and knelt about her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) bed, lifting their voices
in the plain prayers she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was accustomed to, it might have been different;
but this well-to-do clergyman, with his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) sophisticated speech, seemed
foreign to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and failed to draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thoughts from the sleeping child.

<p/>The ninth day passed, but Esther recovered slowly, and it was decided that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) should not leave the hospital before the end of the third week. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
knew that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) crossed the threshold of the hospital there would be no
more peace for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was frightened as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) listened to the
never-ending rumble of the street. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) spent whole hours thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
dear mother, and longing for some news from home, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) face brightened
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was told that her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sister had come to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jenny, what has happened; is mother very bad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother is dead, that's what I've come to tell you; I'd have come before,
but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother dead! Oh, no, Jenny! Oh, Jenny, not my poor mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes Esther. I knew it would cut you up dreadful; we was all very sorry,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)'s dead. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)'s dead a long time now, I was just a-going to tell
you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jenny, what do you mean? Dead a long time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) was buried more than a week ago. We were so sorry you couldn't
be at the funeral. We was all there, and had crape on our dresses and
father had crape on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) `at. We all cried, especially in church and about
the grave, and when the sexton threw in the soil it sounded that hollow it
made me sob. Julia, she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) `ead and asked to be buried with mother,
and I had to lead her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) away; and then we went `ome to dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Jenny, our poor mother gone from us for ever! How did she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) die? Tell
me, was it a peaceful death? Did she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) suffer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There ain't much to tell. Mother was taken bad almost immediately after
you was with us the last time. Mother was that bad all the day long and
all night too we could `ardly stop in the `ouse; it gave one just the
creeps to listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) crying and moaning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, then the baby was born. It was dead, and mother died of weakness;
prostration the doctor called it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) face in the pillow. Jenny waited, and an anxious look of
self began to appear on the vulgar London street face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look `ere, Esther, you can cry when I've gone; I've a deal to say to yer
and time is short.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Jenny, don't speak like that! Father, was he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) kind to mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dunno that he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) thought much about it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) spent `alf `is time in the
public, 'e did. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) couldn't abide the `ouse with a woman
a-screaming like that. One of the neighbours came in to look after mother,
and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had the doctor.''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sister through
streaming tears, and the woman in the other bed alluded to the folly of
poor women being confined <div class="bookquote">``in their own `omes--in a `ome where there is a
drunken `usband, and most `omes is like that nowadays.''

 (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment Esther's baby awoke crying for the breast. The little lips
caught at the nipple, the wee hand pressed the white curve, and in a
moment Esther's face took that expression of holy solicitude which Raphael
sublimated in the Virgin's downward-gazing eyes. Jenny watched the
gluttonous lips, interested in the spectacle, and yet absorbed in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)
had come to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your baby do look `ealthy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is too, not an ache or a pain. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s as beautiful a boy as
ever lived. But think of poor mother, Jenny, think of poor mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do think of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), Esther. But I can't help seeing your baby. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s like
you, Esther. I can see a look of you in `is eyes. But I don't know that I
should care to `ave a baby meself--the expense comes very `eavy on a poor
girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please God, my baby shall never want for anything as long as I can work
for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). But, Jenny, my trouble will be a lesson to you. I hope you will
always be a good girl, and never allow yourself to be led away; you
promise me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A `ome like ours, a drunken father, and now that poor mother is gone it
will be worse than ever. Jenny, you are the eldest and must do your best
to look after the younger ones, and as much as possible to keep father
from the public-house. I shall be away; the moment I'm well enough I must
look out for a place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just what I came to speak to you about. Father is going to
Australia. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) is that tired of England, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) situation on
the railway he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) has made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) mind to emigrate. It is pretty well all
arranged; he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) has been to an agency and they say he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'ll `ave to pay two
pounds a `ead, and that runs to a lot of money in a big family like ours.
So I'm likely to get left, for father says that I'm old enough to look
after myself. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s willing to take me if I gets the money, not without.
That's what I came to tell yer about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther understood that Jenny had come to ask for money. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) could not give
it, and lapsed into thinking of this sudden loss of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) family. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)
did not know where Australia was; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) fancied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) had once heard that
it took months to get there. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) knew that they were all going from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>), they were going out on the sea in a great ship that would sail and
sail further and further away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) could see the ship from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) bedside, at
first strangely distinct, alive with hands and handkerchiefs; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) could
distinguish all the children--Jenny, Julia, and little Ethel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ethel</b></font>) lost
sight of their faces as the ship cleared the harbour. Soon after the ship
was far away on the great round of waters, again a little while and all
the streaming canvas not larger than a gull's wing, again a little while
and the last speck on the horizon hesitated and disappeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you crying about, Esther? I never saw yer cry before. It do seem
that odd.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm so weak. Mother's death has broken my heart, and now to know that I
shall never see any one of you again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It do seem `ard. We shall miss you sadly. But I was going to say that
father can't take me unless I finds two pounds. You won't see me stranded,
will you, Esther?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot give you the money, Jenny. Father has had too much of my money
already; there's `ardly enough to see me through. I've only four pounds
left. I cannot give you my child's money; God knows how we shall live
until I can get to work again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're nearly well now. But if yer can't help me, yer can't. I don't know
what's to be done. Father can't take me if I don't find the money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You say the agency wants two pounds for each person?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I've four. We might both go if it weren't for the baby, but I don't
suppose they'd make any charge for a child on the breast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dunno. There's father; yer know what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) don't want me; I'm not one of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). But, Jenny, dear, it
is terrible to be left all alone. Poor mother dead, and all of you going
to Australia. I shall never see one of you again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The conversation paused. Esther changed the baby from the left to the
right breast, and Jenny tried to think what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) had best say to induce her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)
sister to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) the money she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) wanted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you don't give me the money I shall be left; it is hard luck, that's
all, for there's fine chances for a girl, they says, out in Australia. If
I remain `ere I dunno what will become of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better look out for a situation. We shall see each other from
time to time. It's a pity you don't know a bit of cooking, enough to take
the place of kitchen-maid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only know that dog-making, and I've `ad enough of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can always get a situation as general servant in a lodging-`ouse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Service in a lodging-`ouse! Not me. You know what that is. I'm surprised
that you'd ask me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what are yer thinking of doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was thinking of going on in the pantomime as one of the hextra ladies,
if they'll `ave me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Jenny, you won't do that, will you? A theatre is only sinfulness, as
we `ave always knowed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know that I don't `old with all them preachy-preachy brethren says
about the theatre.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't argue--I `aven't the strength, and it interferes with the milk.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>And then, as if prompted by some association of ideas, Esther said, <div class="bookquote">``I
hope, Jenny, that you'll take example by me and will do nothing foolish;
you'll always be a good girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if I gets the chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry to `ear you speak like that, and poor mother only just dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>The words that rose to Jenny's lips were: <div class="bookquote">``A nice one you are, with a baby
at your breast, to come a-lecturing me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>but, fearing Esther's temper, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
checked the dangerous words and said instead--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean that I was a-going on the streets right away this very
evening, only that a girl left alone in London without anyone to look to
may go wrong in spite of herself, as it were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A girl never need go wrong; if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) does it is always `er own fault.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther spoke mechanically, but suddenly remembering her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) own circumstances
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I'd give you the money if I dared, but for the child's sake I
mustn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can afford it well enough--I wouldn't ask you if you couldn't. You'll
be earning a pound a week presently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A pound a week! What do you mean, Jenny?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yer can get that as wet-nurse, and yer food too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do yer know that, Jenny?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A friend of mine who was `ere last year told me she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) got it, and you can
get it too if yer likes. Fancy a pound for the next six months, and
everything found. Yer might spare me the money and let me go to Australia
with the others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd give yer the money if what you said was true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yer can easily find out what I say is the truth by sending for the
matron. Shall I go and fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>)? I won't be a minute; you'll see what she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>)
says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>A few moments after Jenny returned with a good-looking, middle-aged woman.
On her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) face there was that testy and perplexed look that comes of much
business and many interruptions. Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) had opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) lips her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) face
had said: <div class="bookquote">``Come, what is it? Be quick about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father and the others is going to Australia. Mother's dead and was buried
last week, so father says there's nothing to keep `im `ere, for there is
better prospects out there. But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) can't take me, for the agency
wants two pounds a `ead, and it was all he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could do to find the money for
the others. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is just short of two pounds, and as I'm the eldest barring
Esther, who is `is step-daughter, 'e says that I had better remain, that
I'm old enough to get my own living, which is very `ard on a girl, for I'm
only just turned sixteen. So I thought that I would come up `ere and tell
my sister--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my good girl, what has all this got to do with me? I can't give you
two pounds to go to Australia. You are only wasting my time for nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Ear me out, missis. I want you to explain to my sister that you can get
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) a situation as a wet-nurse at a pound a week--that's the usual money

she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'ll give me two pounds and I shall be able to go with father to
Australia, where they says there is fine chances for a girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The matron</b></font>)</div><p/>The matron examined in critical disdain the vague skirt, the broken boots,
and the misshapen hat, coming all the while to rapid conclusions regarding
the moral value of this unabashed child of the gutter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think your sister will be very foolish if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) gives you her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I'm not--that's just what I'm afraid of; but father is, and I can
prove it to you. I've brought a letter from father--`ere it is; now, is
that good enough for yer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, no impertinence, or I'll order you out of the hospital in double
quick time,''  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said the matron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't intend no impertinence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>said Jenny humbly, <div class="bookquote">``only I didn't like
to be told I was telling lies when I was speaking the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I see that your father is going to Australia,''  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>the matron replied,
returning the letter to Jenny; <div class="bookquote">``you want your sister to give you her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) money
to take you there too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What I wants is for you to tell my sister that you can get her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) a
situation as wet-nurse; then perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'ll give me the money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If your sister wants to go out as wet-nurse, I daresay I could get her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) a
pound a week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther, <div class="bookquote">``I should have to put baby out at nurse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll have to do that in any case,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny interposed; <div class="bookquote">``you can't live
for nine months on your savings and have all the nourishing food that
you'll want to keep your milk going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I was yer sister I'd see yer further before I'd give yer my money. You
must `ave a cheek to come a-asking for it, to go off to Australia where a
girl `as chances, and yer sister with a child at the breast left behind.
Well I never!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>Jenny and the matron turned suddenly and looked at the woman in the
opposite bed who had so unexpectedly expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) views. Jenny was
furious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What odds is it to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) screamed; <div class="bookquote">``what business is it of yours,
coming poking your nose in my affairs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, now, I can't have any rowing,''  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the matron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rowing! I should like to know what business it is of `ers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, hush, I can't have you interfering with my patients; another word
and I'll order you out of the hospital.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Horder me out of the horspital! and what for? Who began it? No, missis,
be fair; wait until my sister gives her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) answer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) must be quick about it--I can't wait about here all day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll give my sister the money to take her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to Australia if you say you can
get me a situation as wet-nurse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think I can do that. It was four pounds five that you gave me to
keep. I remember the amount, for since I've been here no one has come with
half that. If they have five shillings they think they can buy half
London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My sister is very careful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>said Jenny, sententiously. The matron looked
sharply at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now come along with me--I'm going to fetch your sister's money. I can't
leave you here--you'd get quarrelling with my patients.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, missis, indeed I won't say nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do as I tell you. Come along with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>So with a passing scowl Jenny expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) contempt for the woman who had
come <div class="bookquote">``a-interfering in `er business,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>and went after the matron, watching
her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) every movement. When they came back Jenny's eyes were fixed on the
matron's fat hand as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) could see the yellow metal through the
fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is your money,''  (<font color='red'><b>the matron pounds</b></font>)</div>said the matron; <div class="bookquote">``four pounds five. You can give
your sister what you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the matron pounds</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther held the four sovereigns and the two half-crowns in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hand for a
moment, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, Jenny, are the two pounds you want to take you to Australia. I `ope
they'll bring you good luck, and that you'll think of me sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I will, Esther. You've been a good sister to me, indeed you `ave;
I shall never forget you, and will write to you... It is very `ard
parting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, never mind those tears. You have got your money; say good-bye
to your sister and run along.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be so `eartless,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>cried Jenny, whose susceptibilities were now on
the move. <div class="bookquote">''`Ave yer no feeling; don't yer know what it is to bid good-bye
to yer sister, and perhaps for ever?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny flung herself into Esther's
arms crying bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Esther, I do love you; yer `ave been that kind
to me I shall never forget it. I shall be very lonely without you. Write
to me sometimes; it will be a comfort to hear how you are getting on. If I
marry I'll send for you, and you'll bring the baby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think I'd leave him (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) behind? Kiss `im before you go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Esther; take care of yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther was now alone in the world, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) remembered the night she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) walked
home from the hospital and how cruel the city had seemed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was now
alone in that great wilderness with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) child, for whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would have to
work for many, many years. How would it all end? Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) be able to live
through it? Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) done right in letting Jenny have the money--her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) boy's
money? She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) should not have given it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) hardly knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) was
doing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) was so weak, and the news of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) mother's death had overcome
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) should not have given Jenny her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) boy's money... But perhaps it
might turn out all right after all. If the matron got her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) a situation as
wet-nurse she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>)'d be able to pull through. <div class="bookquote">``So they would separate us,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>)
whispered, bending over the sleeping child. <div class="bookquote">``There is no help for it, my
poor darling. There's no help for it, no help for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Next day Esther was taken out of bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) spent part of the afternoon
sitting in an easy-chair, and Mrs. Jones came to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>). The little old
woman seemed like one whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had known always, and Esther told her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mother's death and the departure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) family for Australia. Perhaps
a week lay between her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) and the beginning of the struggle which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
dreaded. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had been told that they did not usually keep anyone in the
hospital more than a fortnight. Three days after Mrs. Jones' visit the
matron came into their room hurriedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but a number of new patients are expected;
there's nothing for it but to get rid of you. It is a pity, for I can see
you are both very weak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, me too?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman in the other bed. <div class="bookquote">``I can hardly stand; I
tried just now to get across the room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very sorry, but we've new patients coming, and there's all our spring
cleaning. Have you any place to go to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No place except a lodging,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther; <div class="bookquote">``and I have only two pounds five
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the use in taking us at all if you fling us out on the street when
we can hardly walk?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the other woman. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I had gone and drowned
myself. I was very near doing it. If I had it would be all over now for me
and the poor baby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm used to all this ingratitude,''  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said the matron. <div class="bookquote">``You have got through
your confinement very comfortably, and your baby is quite healthy; I hope
you'll try and keep it so. Have you any money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only four-and-sixpence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you got any friends to whom you can go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you'll have to apply for admission to the workhouse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The woman made no answer, and at that moment two sisters came and forcibly
began to dress her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fell back from time to time in their arms, almost
fainting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord, what a job!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said one sister; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s just like so much lead in
one's arms. But if we listened to them we should have them loafing here
over a month more.''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>Esther did not require much assistance, and the sister
said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, you are as strong as they make 'em; you might have gone two
days ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're no better than brutes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther muttered. Then, turning to the
matron, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You promised to get me a situation as wet-nurse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, so I did, but the lady who I intended to recommend you to wrote this
morning to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had suited herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But do you think you could get me a situation as wet-nurse?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the
other woman; <div class="bookquote">``it would save me from going to the workhouse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I really don't know what to do with you all; you all want to stop in the
hospital at least a month, eating and drinking the best of everything, and
then you want situations as wet-nurses at a pound a week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther, indignantly, <div class="bookquote">``I never should have given my sister two
pounds if you had not told me you could get me the situation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said the matron, <div class="bookquote">``to have to send you away. I should like to
have kept you, but really there is no help for it. As for the situation,
I'll do the best I can. It is true that place I intended for you is filled
up, but there will be another shortly, and you shall have the first. Give
me your address. I shall not keep you long waiting, you can depend upon
me. You are still very weak, I can see that. Would you like to have one of
the nurses to walk round with you? You had better--you might fall and hurt
the baby. My word, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is a fine boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is a beautiful boy; it will break my heart to part with him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>girls</b></font>)</div><p/>Some eight or nine poor girls stood outside, dressed alike in dingy
garments. They were like half-dead flies trying to crawl through an
October afternoon; and with their babies and a keen wind blowing, they
found it difficult to hold on their hats.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It do catch you a bit rough, coming out of them `ot rooms,''  (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div>said a woman
standing by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'm that weak I can `ardly carry my baby. I dunno `ow I
shall get as far as the Edgware Road. I take my `bus there. Are you going
that way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm going close by, round the corner.''




 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>XVIII


<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair hung about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands and wrists were shrunken, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) flesh was
soft and flabby, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had dark shadows in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face. Nursing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child
seemed to draw all strength from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nervous depression
increased; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was too weary and ill to think of the future, and for a
whole week her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) physical condition held her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), to the exclusion of every
other thought. Mrs. Jones was very kind, and only charged her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) ten
shillings a week for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) board and lodging, but this was a great deal when
only two pounds five shillings remained between her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) and the workhouse, and
this fact was brought home to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) when Mrs. Jones came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) for the
first week's money. Ten shillings gone; only one pound fifteen shillings
left, and still she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) was so weak that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) could hardly get up and down
stairs. But if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) were twice as weak, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) had to crawl along the
street on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) hands and knees, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) must go to the hospital and implore the
matron to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) a situation as wet-nurse. It was raining heavily, and
Mrs. Jones said it was madness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) to go out in such weather, but go
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) must; and though it was distant only a few hundred yards, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) often
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) would like to lie down and die. And at the hospital only
disappointment. Why hadn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) called yesterday? Yesterday two ladies of
title had come and taken two girls away. Such a chance might not occur for
some time. <div class="bookquote">``For some time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>thought Esther; <div class="bookquote">``very soon I shall have to
apply for admission at the workhouse.''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) reminded the matron of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
promise, and returned home more dead than alive. Mrs. Jones helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) to
change her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) clothes, and bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) be of good heart. Esther looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
hopelessly, and sitting down on the edge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) bed she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) put the baby to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) breast.

<p/>Another week passed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had been to the hospital every day, but no one
had been to inquire for a wet-nurse. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) money was reduced to a few
shillings, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) tried to reconcile herself to the idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) might
do worse than to accept the harsh shelter of the workhouse. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) nature
revolted against it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) must do what was best for the child. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
often asked herself how it would all end, and the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thought, the
more terrible did the future seem. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) miserable meditations were
interrupted by a footstep on the stairs. It was Mrs. Jones, coming to tell
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) that a lady who wanted a wet-nurse had come from the hospital; and a
lady entered dressed in a beautiful brown silk, and looked around the
humble room, clearly shocked at its poverty. Esther, who was sitting on
the bed, rose to meet the fine lady, a thin woman, with narrow temples,
aquiline features, bright eyes, and a disagreeable voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are the young person who wants a situation as wet-nurse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that your first child?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that's a pity. But it doesn't matter much, so long as you and your
baby are healthy. Will you show it to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is asleep now, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther said, raising the bed-clothes; <div class="bookquote">``there
never was a healthier child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) seems healthy enough. You have a good supply of milk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fifteen shillings, and all found. Does that suit you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had expected a pound a week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is only your first baby. Fifteen shillings is quite enough. Of course
I only engage you subject to the doctor's approval. I'll ask him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) to call.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, ma'am; I shall be glad of the place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it is settled. You can come at once?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must arrange to put my baby out to nurse, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The lady's face clouded. But following up another train of thought, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you must arrange about your baby, and I hope you'll make proper
arrangements. Tell the woman in whose charge you leave it that I shall
want to see it every three weeks. It will be better so,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) added under
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) breath, <div class="bookquote">``for two have died already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is my card,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady--<div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Rivers, Curzon Street,
Mayfair--and I shall expect you to-morrow afternoon--that is to say, if
the doctor approves of you. Here is one-and-sixpence for your cab fare.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall expect you not later than four o'clock. I hope you won't
disappoint me; remember my child is waiting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rivers</b></font>)</div><p/>When Mrs. Rivers left, Esther consulted with Mrs. Jones. The difficulty
was now where she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) should put the child out at nurse. It was now just after
two o'clock. The baby was fast asleep, and would want nothing for three or
four hours. It would be well for Esther to put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hat and jacket and
go off at once. Mrs. Jones gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) the address of a respectable woman who
used to take charge of children. But this woman was nursing twins, and
could not possibly undertake the charge of another baby. And Esther
visited many streets, always failing for one reason or another. At last
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) found herself in Wandsworth, in a battered tumble-down little street,
no thoroughfare, only four houses and a coal-shed. Broken wooden palings
stood in front of the small area into which descent was made by means of a
few wooden steps. The wall opposite seemed to be the back of some stables,
and in the area of No. 3 three little mites were playing. The baby was
tied in a chair, and a short fat woman came out of the kitchen at Esther's
call, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) dirty apron sloping over her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) high stomach, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) pale brown
hair twisted into a knot at the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I came about putting a child out to nurse. You are Mrs. Spires, ain't
yer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's my name. May I ask who sent you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther told her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and then Mrs. Spires asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) to step down into the
kitchen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Them `ere children you saw in the area I looks after while their mothers
are out washing or charing. They takes them `ome in the evening. I only
charges them four-pence a-day, and it is a loss at that, for they does
take a lot of minding. What age is yours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mine is only a month old. I've a chance to go out as wet-nurse if I can
find a place to put him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) out at nurse. Will you look after my baby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much do you think of paying for him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Five shillings a week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you a-going out as wet-nurse at a pound a week; you can afford more
than that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm only getting fifteen shillings a week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you can afford to pay six. I tell you the responsibility I of
looking after a hinfant is that awful nowadays that I don't care to
undertake it for less.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther hesitated; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not like this woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, altering her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tone to one of mild
interrogation, <div class="bookquote">``you would like your baby to have the best of everything,
and not the drainings of any bottle that's handy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like my child to be well looked after, and I must see the child
every three weeks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you expect me to bring up the child to wherever the lady lives, and
pay my `bus fare, all out of five shillings a week? It can't be done!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther did not answer. <div class="bookquote">``You ain't married, of course?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Spires</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Spires said
suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I ain't; what about that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing; there is so many of you, that's all. You can't lay yer `and
on the father and get a bit out of `im?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The conversation paused. Esther felt strangely undecided. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looked round
suspiciously, and noticing the look the woman said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your baby will be well looked after `ere; a nice warm kitchen, and I've
no other babies for the moment; them children don't give no trouble, they
plays in the area. You had better let me have the child; you won't do
better than `ere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther promised to think it over and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) know to-morrow. It took her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
many omnibuses to get home, and it was quite dark when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) pushed the door
to. The first thing that caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) ear was her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) child crying. <div class="bookquote">``What is the
matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) cried, hurrying down the passage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, is that you? You have been away a time. The poor child is that hungry
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has been crying this hour or more. If I'd `ad a bottle I'd `ave given
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a little milk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hungry, is he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)? Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shall have plenty soon. It is nearly the last time
I shall nurse the poor darling.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) told Mrs. Jones about Mrs.
Spires, and both women tried to arrive at a decision.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since you have to put the child out to nurse, you might as well put him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
there as elsewhere; the woman will look after him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
can--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll do that, if it is for the sake of the six shillings a week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, I know; but I've always heard that children die that are put
out to nurse. If mine died I never should forgive myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) could not sleep; she (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) lay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) arms about her (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) baby, distracted at
the thought of parting from him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). What had she (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) done that her (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) baby should be
separated from her (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>)? What had the poor little darling done? He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) at least was
innocent; why should he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) be deprived of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mother? At midnight she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) got up
and lighted a candle, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), took him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms, squeezed him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bosom till he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cried, and the thought came that it would be sweeter to
kill him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own hands than to be parted from him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).

<p/>The thought of murder went with the night, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) enjoyed the journey to
Wandsworth. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) baby laughed and cooed, and was much admired in the
omnibus, and the little street where Mrs. Spires lived seemed different. A
cart of hay was being unloaded, and this gave the place a pleasant rural
air. Mrs. Spires, too, was cleaner, tidier; Esther no longer disliked her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>);
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had a nice little cot ready for the baby, and he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) seemed so comfortable
in it that Esther did not feel the pangs at parting which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had expected
to feel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would see him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) in a few weeks, and in those weeks she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would be
richer. It seemed quite wonderful to earn so much money in so short a
time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had had a great deal of bad luck, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) luck seemed to have
turned at last. So engrossed was she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) in the consideration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) good
fortune that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) nearly forgot to get out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) `bus at Charing Cross,
and had it not been for the attention of the conductor might have gone on,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not know where--perhaps to Clerkenwell, or may be to Islington.
When the second `bus turned into Oxford Street she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) got out, not wishing to
spend more money than was necessary. Mrs. Jones approved of all she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) had
done, helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) to pack up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) box, and sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) away with many kind
wishes to Curzon Street in a cab.

<p/>Esther was full of the adventure and the golden prospect before her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
wondered if the house she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was going to was as grand as Woodview, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
was struck by the appearance of the maidservant who opened the door to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, here you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rivers</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Rivers said. <div class="bookquote">``I have been anxiously expecting
you; my baby is not at all well. Come up to the nursery at once. I don't
know your name,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) said, turning to Esther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Waters, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Emily, you'll see that Waters' box is taken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll see to it, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then come up at once, Waters. I hope you'll succeed better than the
others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>A gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>A tall, handsome gentleman stood at the door of a room full of beautiful
things, and as they went past him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) Mrs. Rivers said, <div class="bookquote">``This is the new
nurse, dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rivers</b></font>)</div>Higher up, Esther saw a bedroom of soft hangings and bright
porcelain. Then another staircase, and the little wail of a child caught
on the ear, and Mrs. Rivers said, <div class="bookquote">``The poor little thing; it never ceases
crying. Take it, Waters, take it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rivers</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther sat down, and soon the little thing ceased crying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to take to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the anxious mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So it seems,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther; <div class="bookquote">``it is a wee thing, not half the size of my
boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope the milk will suit it, and that it won't bring up what it takes.
This is our last chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I daresay it will come round, ma'am. I suppose you weren't strong enough
to nurse it yourself, and yet you looks healthy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I? No, I could not undertake to nurse it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Then, glancing suspiciously at
Esther, whose breast was like a little cup, Mrs. Rivers said, <div class="bookquote">``I hope you
have plenty of milk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rivers</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, ma'am; they said at the hospital I could bring up twins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your supper will be ready at nine. But that will be a long time for you
to wait. I told them to cut you some sandwiches, and you'll have a glass
of porter. Or perhaps you'd prefer to wait till supper? You can have your
supper, you know, at eight, if you like?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther took a sandwich and Mrs. Rivers poured out a glass of porter. And
later in the evening Mrs. Rivers came down from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) drawing-room to see
that Esther's supper was all right, and not satisfied with the handsome
fare that had been laid before her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) child's nurse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) went into the
kitchen and gave strict orders that the meat for the future was not to be
quite so much cooked.

<p/>Henceforth it seemed to Esther that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was eating all day. The food was
doubtless necessary after the great trial of the flesh she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had been
through, likewise pleasant after her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) long abstinences. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) grew happy in
the tide of new blood flowing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) veins, and might easily have
abandoned herself in the seduction of these carnal influences. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
moral nature was of tough fibre, and made mute revolt. Such constant
mealing did not seem natural, and the obtuse brain of this lowly
servant-girl was perplexed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) self-respect was wounded; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
position in this house, and sought consolation in the thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was
earning good money for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) baby. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) noticed, too, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) never was
allowed out alone, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) walks were limited to just sufficient
exercise to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) in health.

<p/>A fortnight passed, and one afternoon, after having put baby to sleep, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
said to Mrs. Rivers, <div class="bookquote">``I hope, ma'am, you'll be able to spare me for a
couple of hours; baby won't want me before then. I'm very anxious about my
little one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rivers</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nurse, I couldn't possibly hear of it; such a thing is never allowed.
You can write to the woman, if you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know how to write, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you can get some one to write for you. But your baby is no doubt all
right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, ma'am, you are uneasy about your baby; you are up in the nursery
twenty times a day; it is only natural I should be uneasy about mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, nurse, I've no one to send with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no reason why any one should go with me, ma'am; I can take care
of myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! let you go off all the way to--where did you say you had left
it--Wandsworth?--by yourself! I really couldn't think of it. I don't want
to be unnecessarily hard--but I really couldn't--no mother could. I must
consider the interests of my child. But I don't want you to agitate
yourself, and if you like I'll write myself to the woman who has charge of
your baby. I cannot do more, and I hope you'll be satisfied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>By what right, by what law, was she (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) separated from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) child? She (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) was
tired of hearing Mrs. Rivers speak of <div class="bookquote">``my child, my child, my child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rivers</b></font>)</div>and
of seeing this fine lady turn up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nose when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own
beautiful boy. When Mrs. Rivers came to engage her (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) had said that it
would be better for the baby to be brought to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) every three or four
weeks, for two had died already. At the time Esther had not understood.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had supposed vaguely, in a passing way, that Mrs. Rivers had already
lost two children. But yesterday the housemaid had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) that that
little thing in the cradle had had two wet-nurses before Esther, and that
both babies had died. It was then a life for a life. It was more. The
children of two poor girls had been sacrificed so that this rich woman's
child might be saved. Even that was not enough, the life of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) beautiful
boy was called for. Then other memories swept into Esther's frenzied
brain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) remembered vague hints, allusions that Mrs. Spires had thrown
out; and as if in the obtuseness of a nightmare, it seemed to this
ignorant girl that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was the victim of a dark and far-reaching
conspiracy; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) experienced the sensation of the captured animal, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
scanned the doors and windows, thinking of some means of escape.

<p/>At that moment a knock was heard and the housemaid came in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The woman who has charge of your baby has come to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther started up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) chair, and fat little Mrs. Spires waddled into
the room, the ends of her (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) shawl touching the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is my baby?''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther. <div class="bookquote">``Why haven't you brought him (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you see, my dear, the sweet little thing didn't seem as well as
usual this afternoon, and I did not care to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) out, it being a long
way and a trifle cold... It is nice and warm in here. May I sit down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, there's a chair; but tell me what is the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little cold, dear--nothing to speak of. You must not excite yourself,
it isn't worth while; besides, it's bad for you and the little darling in
the cradle. May I have a look?... A little girl, isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is a girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``And a beautiful little girl too. <div class="bookquote">``Ow `ealthy she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) do look! I'll be bound
you have made a difference in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). I suppose you are beginning to like her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
just as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was your own?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther did not answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yer know, all you girls are dreadful taken with their babies at first.
But they is a awful drag on a girl who gets her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) living in service. For my
part I do think it providential-like that rich folk don't nurse their own.
If they did, I dunno what would become of all you poor girls. The
situation of wet-nurse is just what you wants at the time, and it is good
money. I hope yer did what I told you and stuck out for a pound a week.
Rich folk like these here would think nothing of a pound a week, nor yet
two, when they sees their child is suited.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind about my money, that's my affair. Tell me what's the matter
with my baby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Ow yer do `arp on it! I've told yer that `e's all right; nothing to
signify, only a little poorly, but knowing you was that anxious I thought
it better to come up. I didn't know but what you might like to `ave in the
doctor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) require the doctor? I thought you said it was nothing to
signify.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends on `ow yer looks at it. Some likes to `ave in the doctor,
however little the ailing; then others won't `ave anything to do with
doctors--don't believe in them. So I thought I'd come up and see what you
thought about it. I would `ave sent for the doctor this morning--I'm one
of those who `as faith in doctors--but being a bit short of money I
thought I'd come up and ask you for a trifle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rivers</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment Mrs. Rivers came into the nursery and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) first look went
in the direction of the cradle, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) turned to consider curtseying
Mrs. Spires.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is Mrs. Spires, the lady who is looking after my baby, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said
Esther; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) has come with bad news--my baby is ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm sorry. But I daresay it is nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Mrs. Spires says, ma'am--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am, the little thing seemed a bit poorly, and I being short of
money, ma'am, I had to come and see nurse. I knows right well that they
must not be disturbed, and of course your child's `ealth is everything;
but if I may make so bold I'd like to say that the little dear do look
beautiful. Nurse is bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) up that well that yer must have every
satisfaction in `er.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) seems to suit the child; that's the reason I don't want her (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>)
upset.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It won't occur again, ma'am, I promise you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther did not answer, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) white, sullen face remained unchanged. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
had a great deal on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mind, and would have spoken if the words did not
seem to betray her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) attempted to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When the baby is well, and the doctor is satisfied there is no danger of
infection, you can bring it here--once a month will be sufficient. Is
there anything more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Spires thinks my baby ought to see the doctor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) send for the doctor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Being a bit short of money--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what we pays is five shillings to the doctor, but then there's the
medicine he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) will order, and I was going to speak to you about a piece of
flannel; if yer could let me have ten shillings to go on with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I haven't so much left. I must see my baby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>and Esther moved towards
the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, nurse, I cannot hear of it; I'd sooner pay the money myself. Now,
how much do you want, Mrs. Spires?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten shillings will do for the present, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here they are; let the child have every attendance, and remember you are
not to come troubling my nurse. Above all, you are not to come up to the
nursery. I don't know how it happened, it was a mistake on the part of the
new housemaid. You must have my permission before you see my nurse.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rivers</b></font>)</div>And
while talking rapidly and imperatively Mrs. Rivers, as it were, drove Mrs.
Spires out of the nursery. Esther could hear them talking on the
staircase, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) listened, all the while striving to collect her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
thoughts. Mrs. Rivers said when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``I really cannot allow her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
to come here upsetting you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then, as if impressed by the sombre look on
Esther's face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``Upsetting you about nothing. I assure you it
will be all right; only a little indisposition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must see my baby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, nurse, you shall see your baby the moment the doctor says it is fit
to come here. You can't expect me to do more than that.''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther did not
move, and thinking that it would not be well to argue with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), Mrs.
Rivers went over to the cradle. <div class="bookquote">``See, nurse, the little darling has just
woke up; come and take her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>), I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) wants you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther did not answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) stood looking into space, and it seemed to
Mrs. Rivers that it would be better not to provoke a scene. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) went
towards the door slowly, but a little cry from the cradle stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>), and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, nurse, what is it? Come, the baby is waiting for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, like one waking from a dream, Esther said: <div class="bookquote">``If my baby is all right,
ma'am, I'll come back, but if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wants me, I'll have to look after him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You forget that I'm paying you fifteen shillings a week. I pay you for
nursing my baby; you take my money, that's sufficient.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do take your money, ma'am. But the housemaid has told me that you
had two wet-nurses before me, and that both their babies died, so I cannot
stop here now that mine's ill. Everyone for her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) own; you can't blame me.
I'm sorry for yours--poor little thing, she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) was getting on nicely too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Waters, you won't leave my baby. It's cruel of you. If I could nurse
it myself--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why couldn't you, ma'am? You look fairly strong and healthy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther spoke in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) quiet, stolid way, finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) words unconsciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know what you're saying, nurse; you can't... You've forgotten
yourself. Next time I engage a nurse I'll try to get one who has lost her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
baby, and then there'll be no bother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a life for a life--more than that, ma'am--two lives for a life; and
now the life of my boy is asked for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rivers</b></font>)</div><p/>A strange look passed over Mrs. Rivers' face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) knew, of course, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) stood well within the law, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) was doing no more than a hundred
other fashionable women were doing at the same moment; but this plain girl
had a plain way of putting things, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not care for it to be
publicly known that the life of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) child had been bought with the lives
of two poor children. But her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) temper was getting the better of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll only be a drag on you. You'll never be able to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) up, poor
little bastard child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is wicked of you to speak like that, ma'am, though it is I who am
saying it. It is none of the child's fault if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hasn't got a father, nor
is it right that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) should be deserted for that... and it is not for you
to tell me to do such a thing. If you had made sacrifice of yourself in
the beginning and nursed your own child such thoughts would not have come
to you. But when you hire a poor girl such as me to give the milk that
belongs to another to your child, you think nothing of the poor deserted
one. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is but a bastard, you say, and had better be dead and done with. I
see it all now; I have been thinking it out. It is all so hidden up that
the meaning is not clear at first, but what it comes to is this, that fine
folks like you pays the money, and Mrs. Spires and her (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) like gets rid of
the poor little things. Change the milk a few times, a little neglect, and
the poor servant girl is spared the trouble of bringing up her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) baby and
can make a handsome child of the rich woman's little starveling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baby</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment the baby began to cry; both women looked in the direction
of the cradle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nurse, you have utterly forgotten yourself, you have talked a great deal
of nonsense, you have said a great deal that is untrue. You accused me of
wishing your baby were dead, indeed I hardly know what wild remarks you
did not indulge in. Of course, I cannot put up with such
conduct--to-morrow you will come to me and apologise. In the meantime the
baby wants you, are you not going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to my own child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That means that you refuse to nurse my baby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you leave my house you shall never enter it again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to enter it again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not pay you one shilling if you leave my baby. You have no

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall try to manage without. I shall go with my baby to the workhouse.
However bad the living may be there, he (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>)'ll be with his (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you go to-night my baby will die. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cannot be brought up on the
bottle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I hope not, ma'am. I should be sorry, indeed I should.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then stay, nurse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go to my baby, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you shall go at once--this very instant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better take your box with you. If you don't I'll shall have it

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>XIX


<p/>The moment Esther got out of the house in Curzon Street she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) felt in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
pocket for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) money. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had only a few pence; enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) `bus fare,
however, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thoughts did not go further. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was absorbed by one
desire, how to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) child--how to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) from Mrs. Spires, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>)
vaguely suspected; from the world, which called him (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) a bastard and denied
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) the right to live. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) sat as if petrified in the corner of the
`bus, seeing nothing but a little street of four houses, facing some
haylofts, the low-pitched kitchen, the fat woman, the cradle in the
corner. The intensity and the oneness of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) desire seemed to annihilate
time, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) got out of the omnibus she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) walked with a sort of
animal-like instinct straight for the house. There was a light in the
kitchen just as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) expected, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) descended the four wooden steps
into the area she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked to see if Mrs. Spires was there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) was there,
and Esther pushed open the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's my baby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord, `ow yer did frighten me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Spires</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Spires, turning from the range
and leaning against the table, which was laid for supper. <div class="bookquote">``Coming like
that into other folk's places without a word of warning--without as much
as knocking at the door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, but I was that anxious about my baby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was you indeed? It is easy to see it is the first one. There it is in the
cradle there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you sent for the doctor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sent for the doctor! I've to get my husband's supper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther took her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) baby out of the cradle. It woke up crying, and Esther
said, <div class="bookquote">``You don't mind my sitting down a moment. The poor little thing
wants its mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Mrs. Rivers saw you now a-nursing of yer baby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't care if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) did. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s thinner than when I left him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); ten days
`ave made a difference in him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yer don't expect a child to do as well without its mother as with
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). But tell me, how did yer get out? You must have come away shortly
after me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wasn't going to stop there and my child ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yer don't mean to tell me that yer `ave gone and thrown hup the
situation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) told me if I went out, I should never enter her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) door again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what did you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) I didn't want to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what, may I ask, are yer thinking of doing? I `eard yer say yer `ad
no money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take my advice, and go straight back and ask `er to overlook it, this
once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d never take me back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will; you suits the child, and that's all they think of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what will become of me and my baby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No more don't I. Yer can't stop always in the work`us, and a baby'll be a
`eavy drag on you. Can't you lay `ands on `is father, some'ow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) head, and Mrs. Spires noticed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) was crying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm all alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I don't know `ow I'm ever to pull through.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not with that child yer won't--it ain't possible... You girls is all
alike, yer thinks of nothing but yer babies for the first few weeks, then
yer tires of them, the drag on yer is that `eavy--I knows yer--and then
yer begins to wish they `ad never been born, or yer wishes they had died
afore they knew they was alive. I don't say I'm not often sorry for them,
poor little dears, but they takes less notice than you'd think for, and
they is better out of the way; they really is, it saves a lot of trouble
hereafter. I often do think that to neglect them, to let them go off
quiet, that I be their best friend; not wilful neglect, yer know, but what
is a woman to do with ten or a dozen, and I often `as as many? I am sure
they'd thank me for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther did not answer, but judging by her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) face that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had lost all hope,
Mrs. Spires was tempted to continue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's that other baby in the far corner, that was brought `ere since
you was `ere by a servant-girl like yerself. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s out a`nursing of a
lady's child, getting a pound a week, just as you was; well, now I asks
`ow she (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) can `ope to bring up that `ere child--a weakly little thing that
wants the doctor and all sorts of looking after. If that child was to live
it would be the ruin of that girl's life. Don't yer `ear what I'm saying?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther, speaking like one in a dream; <div class="bookquote">``don't she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) care
for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) baby, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) used to care for them, but if they had all lived I should like to
know where she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'d be. There `as been five of them--that's the fifth--so,
instead of them a-costing `er money, they brings `er money. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) `as never
failed yet to suit `erself in a situation as wet-nurse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And they all died?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, they all died; and this little one don't look as if it was long for
the world, do it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Spires</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Spires, who had taken the infant from the
cradle to show Esther. Esther looked at the poor wizened features,
twitched with pain, and the far-off cry of doom, a tiny tinkle from the
verge, shivered in the ear with a strange pathos.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It goes to my `eart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Spires</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Spires, <div class="bookquote">``it do indeed, but, Lord, it is
the best that could `appen to 'em; who's to care for 'em? and there is
`undreds and `undreds of them--ay, thousands and thousands every year--and
they all dies like the early shoots. It is `ard, very `ard, poor little
dears, but they is best out of the way--they is only an expense and a
disgrace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Spires</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Spires talked on in a rapid, soothing, soporific voice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) had just
finished pouring some milk in the baby's bottle and had taken down a jug
of water from the dresser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But that's cold water,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther, waking from the stupor of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
despair; <div class="bookquote">``it will give the baby gripes for certain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've no `ot water ready; I'll let the bottle stand afore the fire,
that'll do as well.''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Watching Esther all the while, Mrs. Spires held the
bottle a few moments before the fire, and then gave it to the child to
suck. Very soon after a cry of pain came from the cradle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The little dear never was well; it wouldn't surprise me a bit if it
died--went off before morning. It do look that poorly. One can't `elp
being sorry for them, though one knows there is no `ouse for them `ere.
Poor little angels, and not even baptised. There's them that thinks a lot
of getting that over. But who's to baptise the little angels?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Baptise them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, sprinkle them, you mean. That's not
the way with the Lord's people;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and to escape from a too overpowering
reality she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) continued to repeat the half-forgotten patter of the Brethren,
<div class="bookquote">``You must wait until it is a symbol of living faith in the Lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Brethren</b></font>)</div>And
taking the baby in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hands for a moment, the wonder crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mind
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would ever grow up and find salvation and testify to the Lord
as an adult in voluntary baptism.

<p/>All the while Mrs. Spires was getting on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) cooking. Several times
she (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) were going to speak, and several times she (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) checked
herself. In truth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) didn't know what to make of Esther. Was her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) love of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) child such love as would enable her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to put up with all hardships for
its sake, or was it the fleeting affection of the ordinary young mother,
which, though ardent at first, gives way under difficulties? Mrs. Spires
had heard many mothers talk as Esther talked, but when the real strain of
life was put upon them they had yielded to the temptation of ridding
themselves of their burdens. So Mrs. Spires could not believe that Esther
was really different from the others, and if carefully handled she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would
do what the others had done. Still, there was something in Esther which
kept Mrs. Spires from making any distinct proposal. But it were a pity to
let the girl slip through her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fingers--five pounds were not picked up
every day. There were three five-pound notes in the cradles. If Esther
would listen to reason there would be twenty pounds, and the money was
wanted badly. Once more greed set Mrs. Spires' tongue flowing, and,
representing herself as a sort of guardian angel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) spoke again about
the mother of the dying child, pressing Esther to think what the girl's
circumstances would have been if they had all lived.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And they all died?''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and a good job, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Spires</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Spires, whose temper for the moment
outsped her (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) discretion. Was this penniless drab doing it on purpose to
annoy her (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>)? A nice one indeed to high-and-mighty it over her (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) would
show her (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) in mighty quick time she (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) had come to the wrong shop. Just as Mrs.
Spires was about to speak out she (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) noticed that Esther was in tears. Mrs.
Spires always looked upon tears as a good sign, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) resolved to give
her (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) one more chance. <div class="bookquote">``What are you crying about?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther, <div class="bookquote">``I don't even know where I shall sleep tonight. I have
only threepence, and not a friend in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now look `ere, if you'll listen to reason I'll talk to you. Yer mustn't
look upon me as a henemy. I've been a good friend to many a poor girl like
you afore now, and I'll be one to you if you're sensible. I'll do for you
what I'm doing for the other girl. Give me five pounds--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Five pounds! I've only a few pence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Ear me out. Go back to yer situation--she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)'ll take you back, yer suits
the child, that's all she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) cares about; ask `er for an advance of five
pounds; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)'ll give it when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) `ears it is to get rid of yer child--they
`ates their nurses to be a-`ankering after their own, they likes them to
be forgotten like; they asks if the child is dead very often, and won't
engage them if it isn't, so believe me she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)'ll give yer the money when yer
tells `er that it is to give the child to someone who wants to adopt it.
That's what you `as to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you'll take the child off my hands for ever for five pounds?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and if you likes to go out again as wet-nurse, I'll take the second
off yer `ands too, and at the same price.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wicked woman; oh, this is awful!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come... What do you mean by talking to me like that? And because I
offered to find someone who would adopt your child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did nothing of the kind; ever since I've been in your house you have
been trying to get me to give you up my child to murder as you are
murdering those poor innocents in the cradles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a lie, but I don't want no hargument with yer; pay me what you owe
me and take yerself hoff. I want no more of yer, do you `ear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther did not shrink before her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) as Mrs. Spires expected. Clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>)
baby more tightly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I've paid you what I owe you, you've had
more than your due. Mrs. Rivers gave you ten shillings for a doctor which
you didn't send for. Let me go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, when yer pays me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's all this row about?''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>said a tall, red-bearded man who had just
come in; <div class="bookquote">``no one takes their babies out of this `ere `ouse before they
pays. Come now, come now, who are yer getting at? If yer thinks yer can
come here insulting of my wife yer mistaken; yer've come to the wrong
shop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've paid all I owe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther. <div class="bookquote">``You're no better than murderers, but
yer shan't have my poor babe to murder for a five-pound note.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take back them words, or else I'll do for yer; take them back,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said,
raising his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Help, help, murder!''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther screamed. Before the brute could seize her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had slipped past, but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could scream again he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had laid hold
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). Esther thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) last moment had come.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let `er go, let `er go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Spires</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Spires, clinging on her (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) husband's
arm. <div class="bookquote">``We don't want the perlice in `ere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perlice! What do I care about the perlice? Let `er pay what she (<font color='blue'><b>babe</b></font>) owes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, Tom; it is only a trifle. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>babe</b></font>) go. Now then, take yer
hook,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) said, turning to Esther; <div class="bookquote">``we don't want nothing to do with such
as you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>With a growl the man loosed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hold, and feeling herself free Esther
rushed through the open doorway. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) feet flew up the wooden steps and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
ran out of the street. So shaken were her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) nerves that the sight of some
men drinking in a public-house frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) ran on again. There was
a cab-stand in the next street, and to avoid the cabmen and the loafers
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hastily crossed to the other side. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heart beat violently, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
thoughts were in disorder, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) walked a long while before she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) realised
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not know where she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was going. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) stopped to ask the way, and
then remembered there was no place where she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) might go.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would have to spend the night in the workhouse, and then?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not know... All sorts of thoughts came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) unsolicited, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) walked on and on. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) rested her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) burden on the parapet of a
bridge, and saw the London night, blue and gold, vast water rolling, and
the spectacle of the stars like a dream from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not
disentangle her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) individuality. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to die in the star-lit city, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) child; and why should such cruelty happen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) more than to the
next one? Steadying her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thoughts with an effort, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Why not go to
the workhouse, only for the night?... She (<font color='blue'><b>babe</b></font>) did not mind for herself, only
she (<font color='blue'><b>babe</b></font>) did not wish her (<font color='blue'><b>babe</b></font>) boy to go there. But if God willed it...''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) shawl about her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) baby and tried once more to persuade herself
into accepting the shelter of the workhouse. It seemed strange even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
that a pale, glassy moon should float high up in the sky, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
should suffer; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looked at the lights that fell like golden
daggers from the Surrey shore into the river. What had she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) done to deserve
the workhouse? Above all, what had the poor, innocent child done to
deserve it? She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) felt that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) once entered the workhouse she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would
remain there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) child paupers for ever. <div class="bookquote">``But what can I do?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
asked herself crazily, and sat down on one of the seats.

<p/>A young man coming home from an evening party looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passed.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) asked herself if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) should run after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) story. Why
should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could so easily spare it. Would he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? But
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could decide to appeal to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had called a passing hansom
and was soon far away. Then looking at the windows of the great hotels,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thought of the folk there who could so easily save her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) from the
workhouse if they knew. There must be many a kind heart behind those
windows who would help her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could only make known her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) trouble. But
that was the difficulty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not make known her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) trouble; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could
not tell the misery she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was enduring. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was so ignorant; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not
make herself understood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would be mistaken for a common beggar.
Nowhere would she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) find anyone to listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). Was this punishment for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wrong-doing? An idea of the blind cruelty of fate maddened her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and in
the delirium of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) misery she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) asked herself if it would not have been
better, perhaps, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had left him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) with Mrs. Spires. What indeed had the
poor little fellow to live for? A young man in evening dress came towards
her (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>), looking so happy and easy in life, walking with long, swinging
strides. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopped and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) was out for a walk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir; I'm out because I've no place to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the story of the baby-farmer and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) listened kindly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>)
thought the necessary miracle was about to happen. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only
complimented her (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) pluck and got up to go. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) understood that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not care to listen to sad stories, and a vagrant came and sat down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The `copper,'''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``will be moving us on presently. It don't much
matter; it's too cold to get to sleep, and I think it will rain. My cough
is that bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) might beg a night's lodging of Mrs. Jones. It was far away; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) did
not think she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) could walk so far. Mrs. Jones might have left, then what
would she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) do? The workhouse up there was much the same as the workhouse
down here. Mrs. Jones couldn't keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) for nothing, and there was no use
trying for another situation as wet-nurse; the hospital would not
recommend her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) again... She (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) must go to the workhouse. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) thoughts
wandered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) father, brothers, and sisters, who had gone
to Australia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) wondered if they had yet arrived, if they ever thought
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>), if--She (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) baby were on their way to the workhouse. They were
going to become paupers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) looked at the vagrant--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had fallen asleep.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew all about the workhouse--should she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) ask him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) what it was like? He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),
too, was friendless. If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had a friend he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not be sleeping on the
Embankment. Should she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) ask him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)? Poor chap, he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was asleep. People were
happy when they were asleep.

<p/>A full moon floated high up in the sky, and the city was no more than a
faint shadow on the glassy stillness of the night; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) longed to float
away with the moon and the river, to be borne away out of sight of this
world.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) baby grew heavy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) arms, and the vagrant, a bundle of rags thrown
forward in a heap, slept at the other end of the bench. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) could not
sleep, and the moon whirled on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) miserable way. Then the glassy
stillness was broken by the measured tramp of the policeman going his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>)
rounds. He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) directed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) to Lambeth Workhouse, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) walked towards
Westminster she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) rousing the vagrant and bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) move onward.




<p/>XX


<p/>Those who came to the workhouse for servants never offered more than
fourteen pounds a year, and these wages would not pay for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) baby's keep
out at nurse. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) friend the matron did all she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) could, but it was always
fourteen pounds. <div class="bookquote">``We cannot afford more.''  (<font color='red'><b>a tradesman</b></font>)</div>At last an offer of sixteen
pounds a year came from a tradesman in Chelsea; and the matron introduced
Esther to Mrs. Lewis, a lonely widowed woman, who for five shillings a
week would undertake to look after the child. This would leave Esther
three pounds a year for dress; three pounds a year for herself.

<p/>What luck!

<p/>The shop was advantageously placed at a street corner. Twelve feet of
fronting on the King's Road, and more than half that amount on the side
street, exposed to every view wall papers and stained glass designs. The
dwelling-house was over the shop; the shop entrance faced the kerb in the
King's Road.

<p/>The Bingleys were Dissenters. They were ugly, and exacted the uttermost
farthing from their customers and their workpeople. Mrs. Bingley was a
tall, gaunt woman, with little grey ringlets on either side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) face.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) spoke in a sour, resolute voice, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) came down in a wrapper to
superintend the cooking. On Sundays she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) wore a black satin, fastened with
a cameo brooch, and round her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) neck a long gold chain. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) manners
were lofty, and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) husband called <div class="bookquote">``Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) answered testily,
<div class="bookquote">``Don't keep on mothering me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) frequently stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to settle his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
necktie or collar. All the week he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wore the same short jacket; on Sundays
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) appeared in an ill-fitting frock-coat. His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) long upper lip was clean
shaven, but under his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) chin there grew a ring of discoloured hair, neither
brown nor red, but the neutral tint that hair which does not turn grey
acquires. When he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) spoke he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mouth wide, and seemed quite
unashamed of the empty spaces and the three or four yellow fangs that
remained.

<p/>John, the elder of the two brothers, was a silent youth whose one passion
seemed to be eavesdropping. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hung round doors in the hopes of
overhearing his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sisters' conversation and if he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) heard Esther and the
little girl who helped Esther in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) work talking in the kitchen, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would
steal cautiously halfway down the stairs. Esther often thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
young woman must be sadly in want of a sweetheart to take on with one such
as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Come along, Amy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would cry, passing out before her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>); and not
even at the end of a long walk did he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) offer her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) arm; and they came
strolling home just like boy and girl.

<p/>Hubert, John's younger brother, was quite different. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hubert</b></font>) had escaped the
family temperament, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hubert</b></font>) had escaped the family upper lip. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hubert</b></font>) was the one
spot of colour in a somewhat sombre household, and Esther liked to hear
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hubert</b></font>) call back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hubert</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``All right, mother, I've got the key; no one
need wait up for me. I'll make the door fast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Hubert, don't be later than eleven. You are not going out dancing
again, are you? Your father will have the electric bell put on the door,
so that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) may know when you come in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girls</b></font>)</div><p/>The four girls were all ruddy-complexioned and long upper-lipped. The
eldest was the plainest; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) father's books, and made the pastry.
The second and third entertained vague hopes of marriage. The youngest was
subject to hysterics, fits of some kind.

<p/>The Bingleys' own house was representative of their ideas, and the taste
they had imposed upon the neighbourhood. The staircase was covered with
white drugget, and the white enamelled walls had to be kept scrupulously
clean. There were no flowers in the windows, but the springs of the blinds
were always in perfect order. The drawing-room was furnished with
substantial tables, cabinets and chairs, and antimacassars, long and wide,
and china ornaments and glass vases. There was a piano, and on this
instrument, every Sunday evening, hymns were played by one of the young
ladies, and the entire family sang in the chorus.

<p/>It was into this house that Esther entered as general servant, with wages
fixed at sixteen pounds a year. And for seventeen long hours every day,
for two hundred and thirty hours every fortnight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) washed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
scrubbed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) cooked, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) ran errands, with never a moment that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) might
call her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) own. Every second Sunday she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was allowed out for four, perhaps
for four and a half hours; the time fixed was from three to nine, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
was expected to be back in time to get the supper ready, and if it were
many minutes later than nine there were complaints.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had no money. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) quarter's wages would not be due for another
fortnight, and as they did not coincide with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) Sunday out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would not
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) baby for another three weeks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) for a month,
and a great longing was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heart to clasp him (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) arms again, to
feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) soft cheek against hers, to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) chubby legs and warm, fat
feet in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hands. The four lovely hours of liberty would slip by, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
would enter on another long fortnight of slavery. But no matter, only to
get them, however quickly they sped from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) resigned herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
fate, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) soul rose in revolt, and it grew hourly more difficult for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
to renounce this pleasure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) must pawn her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) dress--the only decent dress
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had left. No matter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) must see the child. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would be able to get
the dress out of pawn when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wages. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would have to
buy herself a pair of boots; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) owed Mrs. Lewis a good deal of money.
Five shillings a week came to thirteen pound a year, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) three
pound a year for boots and clothes, journeys back and forward, and
everything the baby might want. Oh, it was not to be done--she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) never would
be able to pull through. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) dare not pawn her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) dress; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)'d
never be able to get it out again. At that moment something bright lying
on the floor, under the basin-stand, caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eye. It was half-a-crown.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looked at it, and as the temptation came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heart to steal, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes and looked round the room.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was in John's room--in the sneak's room. No one was about. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would
have cut off one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) fingers for the coin. That half-crown meant
pleasure and a happiness so tender and seductive that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes
for a moment. The half-crown she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) held between forefinger and thumb
presented a ready solution of the besetting difficulty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) threw out the
insidious temptation, but it came quickly upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) again. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not
take the half-crown she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would not be able to go Peckham on Sunday. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
could replace the money where she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) found it when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wages. No
one knew it was there; it had evidently rolled there, and having tumbled
between the carpet and the wall had not been discovered. It had probably
lain there for months, perhaps it was utterly forgotten. Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) need
not take it now. It would be quite safe if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) put it back in its place;
on Sunday afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would take it, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) changed it at once--It
was not marked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) examined it all over. No, it was not marked. Then the
desire paused, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wondered how she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), an honest girl, who had never
harboured a dishonest thought in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) life before, could desire to steal; a
bitter feeling of shame came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).

<p/>It was a case of flying from temptation, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) left the room so
hurriedly that John, who was spying in the passage, had not time either to
slip downstairs or to hide in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) brother's room. They met face to face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I beg pardon, sir, but I found this half-crown in your room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there's nothing wonderful in that. What are you so agitated about?
I suppose you intended to return it to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Intended to return it! Of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a dog</b></font>)</div><p/>An expression of hate and contempt leaped into her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) handsome grey eyes,
and, like a dog's, the red lip turned down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) suddenly understood that
this pasty-faced, despicable chap had placed the coin where it might have
accidentally rolled, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would be likely to find it. He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) had
complained that morning that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not keep his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) room sufficiently clean!
It was a carefully-laid plan, he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) all the while, and no
doubt thought that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) own indiscretion that had prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) from
falling into the snare. Without a word Esther dropped the half-crown at
his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) feet and returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) work; and all the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) remained in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
present situation she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) persistently refused to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) brought
him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) asked for, but never answered him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>), even with a Yes or No.

<p/>It was during the few minutes' rest after dinner that the burden of the
day pressed heaviest upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>); then a painful weariness grew into her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
limbs, and it seemed impossible to summon strength and will to beat
carpets or sweep down the stairs. But if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) were not moving about before
the clock struck, Mrs. Bingley came down to the kitchen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Esther, is there nothing for you to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And again, about eight o'clock, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) felt too tired to bear the weight of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own flesh. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had passed through fourteen hours of almost
unintermittent toil, and it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) would never be able to
summon up sufficient courage to get through the last three hours. It was
this last summit that taxed all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) strength and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) will. Even the
rest that awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) at eleven o'clock was blighted by the knowledge of
the day that was coming; and its cruel hours, long and lean and
hollow-eyed, stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) through the darkness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was often too tired
to rest, and rolled over and over in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) miserable garret bed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) whole
body aching. Toil crushed all that was human out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>); even her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) baby was
growing indifferent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>). If it were to die! She (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) did not desire her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
baby's death, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) could not forget what the baby-farmer had told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)--the burden would not become lighter, it would become heavier and
heavier. What would become of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)? Was there no hope? She (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) face
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) pillow, seeking to escape from the passion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) despair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was
an unfortunate girl, and had missed all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) chances.

<p/>In the six months she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had spent in the house in Chelsea her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) nature had
been strained to the uttermost, and what we call chance now came to decide
the course of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) destiny. The fight between circumstances and character
had gone till now in favour of character, but circumstances must call up
no further forces against character. A hair would turn the scale either
way. One morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was startled out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sleep by a loud knocking at
the door. It was Mrs. Bingley, who had come to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) knew what
time it was. It was nearly seven o'clock. But Mrs. Bingley could not blame
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) much, having herself forgotten to put on the electric bell, and Esther
hurried through her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) dressing. But in hurrying she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) happened to tread on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
dress, tearing it right across. It was most unfortunate, and just when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
was most in a hurry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) held up the torn skirt. It was a poor, frayed,
worn-out rag that would hardly bear mending again. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mistress was
calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>); there was nothing for it but to run down and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) what
had happened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't you got another dress that you can put on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, I can't have you going to the door in that thing. You don't do
credit to my house; you must get yourself a new dress at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther muttered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had no money to buy one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I don't know what you do with your money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What I do with my wages is my affair; I've plenty of use for my money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot allow any servant of mine to speak to me like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther did not answer, and Mrs. Bingley continued--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is my duty to know what you do with your money, and to see that you do
not spend it in any wrong way. I am responsible for your moral welfare.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, ma'am, I think I had better leave you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave me, because I don't wish you to spend your money wrongfully,
because I know the temptations that a young girl's life is beset with?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There ain't much chance of temptation for them who work seventeen hours a
day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Esther, you seem to forget--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, ma'am; but there's no use talking about what I do with my
money--there are other reasons; the place is too hard a one. I've felt it
so for some time, ma'am. My health ain't equal to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Once she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had spoken, Esther showed no disposition to retract, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
steadily resisted all Mrs. Bingley's solicitations to remain with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
knew the risk she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was running in leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) situation, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) felt
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) must yield to an instinct like that which impels the hunted animal to
leave the cover and seek safety in the open country. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) whole body cried
out for rest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) must have rest; that was the thing that must be. Mrs.
Lewis would keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) baby for twelve shillings a week; the present
was the Christmas quarter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) was richer by five and twenty shillings
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) had been before. Mrs. Bingley had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) ten shillings, Mr.
Hubert five, and the other ten had been contributed by the four young
ladies. Out of this money she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) hoped to be able to buy a dress and a pair
of boots, as well as a fortnight's rest with Mrs. Lewis. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) had
determined on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) plans some three weeks before her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) month's warning would
expire, and henceforth the mountainous days of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) servitude drew out
interminably, seeming more than ever exhausting, and the longing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>)
heart to be free at times rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) head, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) brain turned as if in
delirium. Every time she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) sat down to a meal she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) remembered she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) was so many
hours nearer to rest--a fortnight's rest--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) could not afford more; but
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) present slavery that fortnight seemed at once as a paradise and an
eternity. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) only fear was that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) health might give way, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>)
would be laid up during the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) intended for rest--personal rest. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>)
baby was lost sight of. Even a mother demands something in return for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>)
love, and in the last year Jackie had taken much and given nothing. But
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) opened Mrs. Lewis's door he (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) came running to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>), calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>)
Mummie; and the immediate preference he (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) showed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>), climbing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>)
knees instead of on Mrs. Lewis's, was a fresh sowing of love in the
mother's heart.

<p/>They were in the midst of those few days of sunny weather which come in
January, deluding us so with their brightness and warmth that we look
round for roses and are astonished to see the earth bare of flowers. And
these bright afternoons Esther spent entirely with Jackie. At the top of
the hill their way led through a narrow passage between a brick wall and a
high paling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had always to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) through this passage, for the
ground there was sloppy and dirty, and the child wanted to stop to watch
the pigs through the chinks in the boards. But when they came to the
smooth, wide, high roads overlooking the valley, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) put him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) down, and he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)
would run on ahead, crying, <div class="bookquote">``Turn for a walk, Mummie, turn along,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)
little feet went so quickly beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) frock that it seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) were
on wheels. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) followed, often forced to break into a run, tremulous lest
he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) should fall. They descended the hill into the ornamental park, and
spent happy hours amid geometrically-designed flower-beds and curving
walks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) ventured with him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) as far as the old Dulwich village, and they
strolled through the long street. Behind the street were low-lying,
shiftless fields, intersected with broken hedges. And when Jackie called
to his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) mother to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) rejoiced in the labour of his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) weight; and
when he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) grew too heavy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) rested on the farm-gate, and looked into the
vague lowlands. And when the chill of night awoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) dream she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>)
clasped Jackie to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) bosom and turned towards home, very soon to lose
herself again in another tide of happiness.

<p/>The evenings, too, were charming. When the candles were lighted, and tea
was on the table, Esther sat with the dozing child on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knee, looking
into the flickering fire, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mind a reverie, occasionally broken by the
homely talk of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) companion; and when the baby was laid in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) cot she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sewing--she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was making herself a new dress; or else the great
kettle was steaming on the hob, and the women stood over the washing-tubs.
On the following evening they worked on either side of the ironing-table,
the candle burning brightly and their vague woman's chatter sounding
pleasant in the hush of the little cottage. A little after nine they were
in bed, and so the days went softly, like happy, trivial dreams. It was
not till the end of the third week that Mrs. Lewis would hear of Esther
looking out for another place. And then Esther was surprised at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) good
fortune. A friend of Mrs. Lewis's knew a servant who was leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>)
situation in the West End of London. Esther got the address, and went next
day after the place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was fortunate enough to obtain it, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
mistress seemed well satisfied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). But one day in the beginning of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) second year of service she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was told that her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mistress wished to speak
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) in the dining-room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div>said the cook, <div class="bookquote">``that it is about that baby of yours; they're
very strict here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Trubner was sitting on a low wicker chair by the fire. She (<font color='blue'><b>Trubner</b></font>) was a
large woman with eagle features. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Trubner</b></font>) eyesight had been failing for some
years, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Trubner</b></font>) maid was reading to her (<font color='blue'><b>Trubner</b></font>). The maid closed the book and left
the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has come to my knowledge, Waters, that you have a child. You're not a
married woman, I believe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been unfortunate; I've a child, but that don't make no difference so
long as I gives satisfaction in my work. I don't think that the cook has
complained, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, the cook hasn't complained, but had I known this I don't think I
should have engaged you. In the character which you showed me, Mrs.
Barfield said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) believed you to be a thoroughly religious girl at
heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I hope I am that, ma'am. I'm truly sorry for my fault. I've suffered
a great deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you all say; but supposing it were to happen again, and in my house?
Supposing--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then don't you think, ma'am, there is repentance and forgiveness? Our
Lord said--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to have told me; and as for Mrs. Barfield, her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) conduct is most
reprehensible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Then, ma'am, would you prevent every poor girl who has had a misfortune
from earning her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bread? If they was all like you there would be more girls
who'd do away with themselves and their babies. You don't know how hard
pressed we are. The baby-farmer says, ``Give me five pounds and I'll find a
good woman who wants a little one, and you shall hear no more about it.<div class="bookquote">''
Them very words were said to me. I took him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) away and hoped to be able to
rear him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>), but if I'm to lose my situations--''

 (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be sorry to prevent anyone from earning their bread--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a mother yourself, ma'am, and you know what it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, it's quite different... I don't know what you mean, Waters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean that if I am to lose my situations on account of my baby, I don't
know what will become of me. If I give satisfaction--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trubner</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment Mr. Trubner entered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trubner</b></font>) was a large, stout man, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Trubner</b></font>)
mother's aquiline features. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trubner</b></font>) arrived with his (<font color='blue'><b>Trubner</b></font>) glasses on his (<font color='blue'><b>Trubner</b></font>) nose, and
slightly out of breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, oh, I didn't know, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Trubner</b></font>) blurted out, and was about to withdraw
when Mrs. Trubner said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the new servant whom that lady in Sussex recommended.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Trubner</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther saw a look of instinctive repulsion come over his (<font color='blue'><b>Trubner</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll leave you to settle with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must speak to you, Harold--I must.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I really can't; I know nothing of this matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Trubner</b></font>) tried to leave the room, and when his (<font color='blue'><b>Trubner</b></font>) mother stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Trubner</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Trubner</b></font>) said
testily, <div class="bookquote">``Well, what is it? I am very busy just now, and--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Trubner
told Esther to wait in the passage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trubner</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Trubner, <div class="bookquote">``have you discharged her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)? I leave all these
things to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trubner</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has told me her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) story; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is trying to bring up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) child on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
wages... She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was kept from earning her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bread she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) didn't know
what would become of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) position is a very terrible one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that... But we can't have loose women about the place. They all
can tell a fine story; the world is full of impostors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think the girl is an impostor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very likely not, but everyone has a right to protect themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't speak so loud, Harold,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Trubner</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Trubner, lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>Trubner</b></font>) voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Remember her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) child is dependent upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); if we send her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) away we don't
know what may happen. I'll pay her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a month's wages if you like, but you
must take the responsibility.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't take any responsibility in the matter. If she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been here two
years--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has only been here a year--not so much more--and had proved a
satisfactory servant, I don't say that we'd be justified in sending her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
away... There are plenty of good girls who want a situation as much as
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). I don't see why we should harbour loose women when there are so many
deserving cases.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you want me to send her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to interfere; you ought to know how to act. Supposing the
same thing were to happen again? My cousins, young men, coming to the
house--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) won't see them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do as you like; it is your business, not mine. It doesn't matter to me,
so long as I'm not interfered with; keep her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) if you like. You ought to
have looked into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) character more closely before you engaged her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). I
think that the lady who recommended her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ought to be written to very
sharply.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>They had forgotten to close the door, and Esther stood in the passage
burning and choking with shame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a strange thing that religion should make some people so
unfeeling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther thought as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) left Onslow Square.

<p/>It was necessary to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) child secret, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) next situation she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
shunned intimacy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) fellow-servants, and was so strict in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
conduct that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) exposed herself to their sneers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) dreaded the remark
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) always went out alone, and often arrived at the cottage
breathless with fear and expectation--at a cottage where a little boy
stood by a stout middle-aged woman, turning over the pages of the
illustrated papers that his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had no money to
buy him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) toys. Dropping the Illustrated London News, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``Here is
Mummie,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and ran to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with outstretched arms. Ah, what an embrace! Mrs.
Lewis continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) sewing, and for an hour or more Esther told about her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
fellow-servants, about the people she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) lived with, the conversation
interrupted by the child calling his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother's attention to the pictures,
or by the delicate intrusion of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) little hand into hers.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) clothes were her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) great difficulty, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) often thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
would rather go back to the slavery of the house in Chelsea than bear the
humiliation of going out any longer on Sunday in the old things that the
servants had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) in for eight or nine months or more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was made to
feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was the lowest of the low--the servant of servants. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had
to accept everybody's sneer and everybody's bad language, and oftentimes
gross familiarity, in order to avoid arguments and disputes which might
endanger her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) situation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had to shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes to the thefts of cooks;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had to fetch them drink, and to do their work when they were unable to
do it themselves. But there was no help for it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not pick and
choose where she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would live, and any wages above sixteen pound a year she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
must always accept, and put up with whatever inconvenience she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) might meet.

<p/>Hers is an heroic adventure if one considers it--a mother's fight for the
life of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child against all the forces that civilisation arrays against
the lowly and the illegitimate. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is in a situation to-day, but on what
security does she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hold it? She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is strangely dependent on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own health,
and still more upon the fortunes and the personal caprice of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
employers; and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) realised the perils of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life when an outcast mother
at the corner of the street, stretching out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rags a brown hand and
arm, asked alms for the sake of the little children. Esther remembered
then that three months out of a situation and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) too would be on the
street as a flower-seller, match-seller, or--

<p/>It did not seem, however, that any of these fears were to be realised. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
luck had mended; for nearly two years she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had been living with some rich
people in the West End; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mistress and was on good terms with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) fellow servants, and had it not been for an accident she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could have
kept this situation. The young gentlemen had come home for their summer
holidays; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had stepped aside to let Master Harry pass on the stairs.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not go by, and there was a strange smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, Esther, I'm awfully fond of you. You are the prettiest girl
I've ever seen. Come out for a walk with me next Sunday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Master Harry, I'm surprised at you; will you let me go by at once?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no one near, the house was silent, and the boy stood on the step
above her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tried to throw his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) waist, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) shook him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
off and went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) room calm with indignation. A few days afterward
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) suddenly became aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was following her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) in the street. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
turned sharply upon him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Master Harry, I know that this is only a little foolishness on your part,
but if you don't leave off I shall lose my situation, and I'm sure you
don't want to do me an injury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div><p/>Master Harry seemed sorry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) promised not to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) in the street
again. And never thinking that it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) who had written the letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
received a few days after, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) asked Annie, the upper housemaid, to read
it. It contained reference to meetings and unalterable affection, and it
concluded with a promise to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) situation through
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fault. Esther listened like one stunned. A schoolboy's folly, the
first silly sentimentality of a boy, a thing lighter than the lightest
leaf that falls, had brought disaster upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).

<p/>If Annie had not seen the letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) might have been able to get the boy
to listen to reason; but Annie had seen the letter, and Annie could not be
trusted. The story would be sure to come out, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) would lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)
character as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) situation. It was a great pity. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mistress had
promised to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) taught cooking at South Kensington, and a cook's
wages would secure her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) child against all ordinary accidents. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)
would never get such a chance again, and would remain a kitchen-maid to
the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) days. And acting on the impulse of the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) went
straight to the drawing-room. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mistress was alone, and Esther handed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) the letter. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you had better see this at once, ma'am. I did
not want you to think it was my fault. Of course the young gentleman means
no harm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has anyone seen this letter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I showed it to Annie. I'm no scholar myself, and the writing was
difficult.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have no reason for supposing--How often did Master Harry speak to
you in this way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only twice, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it is only a little foolishness. I needn't say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) doesn't
mean what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), ma'am, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) continued I should lose my situation.''

will be for you to leave. I am much obliged to you for showing me this
letter. Master Harry, you see, says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is going away to the country
for a week. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) left this morning. So I really think that a month's wages
will settle matters nicely. You are an excellent servant, and I shall be
glad to recommend you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Esther heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mistress mutter something about the danger of
good-looking servants. And Esther was paid a month's wages, and left that
afternoon.




<p/>XXI


<p/>It was the beginning of August, and London yawned in every street; the
dust blew unslaked, and a little cloud curled and disappeared over the
crest of the hill at Hyde Park Corner; the streets and St. George's Place
looked out with blind, white eyes; and in the deserted Park the trees
tossed their foliage restlessly, as if they wearied and missed the fashion
of their season. And all through Park Lane and Mayfair, caretakers and
gaunt cats were the traces that the caste on which Esther depended had
left of its departed presence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was coming from the Alexandra Hotel,
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had heard a kitchen-maid was wanted. Mrs. Lewis had urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) to
wait until people began to come back to town. Good situations were rarely
obtainable in the summer months; it would be bad policy to take a bad one,
even if it were only for a while. Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) had saved a little money,
and, feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) required a rest, had determined to take this advice.
But as luck would have it Jackie fell ill before she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) had been at Dulwich a
week. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) illness made a big hole in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) savings, and it had become
evident that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) would have to set to work and at once.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) turned into the park. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) was going north, to a registry office near
Oxford Street, which Mrs. Lewis had recommended. Holborn Row was difficult
to find, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) had to ask the way very often, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) suddenly knew that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) was in the right street by the number of servant-girls going and
coming from the office, and in company with five others Esther ascended a
gloomy little staircase. The office was on the first floor. The doors were
open, and they passed into a special odour of poverty, as it were, into an
atmosphere of mean interests.

<p/>Benches covered with red plush were on either side, and these were
occupied by fifteen or twenty poorly-dressed women. A little old woman,
very white and pale, stood near the window recounting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) misfortunes to
no one in particular.

<p/>``I lived with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) more than thirty years; I brought up all the children. I
entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) service as nurse, and when the children grew up I was given
the management of everything. For the last fifteen years my mistress was a
confirmed invalid. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) entrusted everything to me. Oftentimes she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) took my
hand and said, ``You are a good creature, Holmes, you mustn't think of
leaving me; how should I get on without you?'' But when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) died they had
to part with me; they said they were very sorry, and wouldn't have thought
of doing so, only they were afraid I was getting too old for the work. I
daresay I was wrong to stop so long in one situation. I shouldn't have
done so, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) always used to say, <div class="bookquote">``You mustn't leave us; we never shall
be able to get on without you.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>the secretary woman</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment the secretary, an alert young woman with a decisive voice,
came through the folding doors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not have all this talking,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) quick eyes fell on the
little old woman, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came forward a few steps. <div class="bookquote">``What, you here again,
Miss Holmes? I've told you that when I hear of anything that will suit you
I'll write.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you said, Miss, but my little savings are running short. I'm being
pressed for my rent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help that; when I hear of anything I'll write. But I can't have
you coming here every third day wasting my time; now run along.''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>And
having made casual remarks about the absurdity of people of that age
coming after situations, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) called three or four women to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) desk, of
whom Esther was one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) examined them critically, and seemed especially
satisfied with Esther's appearance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be difficult,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``to find you the situation you want
before people begin to return to town. If you were only an inch or two
taller I could get you a dozen places as housemaid; tall servants are all
the fashion, and you are the right age--about five-and-twenty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther left a dozen stamps with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and soon after she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) began to receive
letters containing the addresses of ladies who required servants. They
were of all sorts, for the secretary seemed to exercise hardly any
discrimination, and Esther was sent on long journeys from Brixton to
Notting Hill to visit poor people who could hardly afford a
maid-of-all-work. These useless journeys were very fatiguing. Sometimes
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was asked to call at a house in Bayswater, and thence she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had to go to
High Street, Kensington, or Earl's Court; a third address might be in
Chelsea. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could only guess which was the best chance, and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was
hesitating the situation might be given away. Very often the ladies were
out, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was asked to call later in the day. These casual hours she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
spent in the parks, mending Jackie's socks or hemming pocket
handkerchiefs, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was frequently delayed till evening; and in the
mildness of the summer twilight, with some fresh disappointment lying
heavy on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heart, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) way from the Marble Arch round the barren
Serpentine into Piccadilly, with its stream of light beginning in the
sunset.

<p/>And standing at the kerb of Piccadilly Circus, waiting for a `bus to take
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to Ludgate Hill Station, the girl grew conscious of the moving
multitude that filled the streets. The great restaurants rose up calm and
violet in the evening sky, the Café Monico, with its air of French
newspapers and Italian wines; and before the grey façade of the
fashionable Criterion hansoms stopped and dinner parties walked across the
pavement. The fine weather had brought the women up earlier than usual
from the suburbs. They came up the long road from Fulham, with white
dresses floating from their hips, and feather boas waving a few inches
from the pavement. But through this elegant disguise Esther could pick out
the servant-girls. Their stories were her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) story. They had been deserted,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had been; and perhaps each had a child to support, only they had
not been so lucky as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had been in finding situations.

<p/>But now luck seemed to have deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). It was the middle of September
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had not yet been able to find the situation she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wanted; and it had
become more and more distressing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to refuse sixteen pound a year.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had calculated it all out, and nothing less than eighteen pound was of
any use to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). With eighteen pound and a kind mistress who would give her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
an old dress occasionally she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) could do very well. But if she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) didn't find
these two pounds she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) did not know what she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) should do. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) might drag on
for a time on sixteen pound, but such wages would drive her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) in the end
into the workhouse. If it were not for the child! But she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) would never
desert her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) darling boy, who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) so dearly, come what might. A sudden
imagination let her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) see him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) playing in the little street, waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
to come home, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) love for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) head like madness. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
wondered at herself; it seemed almost unnatural to love anything as she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
did this child.

<p/>Then, in a shiver of fear, determined to save her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) `bus fare, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
way through Leicester Square. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was a good-looking girl, who hastened
her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) steps when addressed by a passer-by or crossed the roadway in sullen
indignation, and who looked in contempt on the silks and satins which
turned into the Empire, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) seemed to lose heart utterly. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had been
walking all day and had not tasted food since the morning, and the
weakness of the flesh brought a sudden weakness of the spirit. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) felt
that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) could struggle no more, that the whole world was against her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) must have food and drink and rest. All this London tempted
her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), and the cup was at her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) lips. A young man in evening clothes had
spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice was soft, the look in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes seemed kindly.

<p/>Thinking of the circumstances ten minutes later it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
had intended to answer him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was now at Charing Cross. There was a
lightness, an emptiness in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) head which she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) could not overcome, and the
crowd appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) like a blurred, noisy dream. And then the dizziness
left her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) realised the temptation she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had escaped. Here, as in
Piccadilly, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) could pick out the servant girls; but here their service
was yesterday's lodging-house--poor and dissipated girls, dressed in vague
clothes fixed with hazardous pins. Two young women strolled in front of
her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>). They hung on each other's arms, talking lazily. They had just come
out of an eating-house, and a happy digestion was in their eyes. The skirt
on the outside was a soiled mauve, and the bodice that went with it was a
soiled chocolate. A broken yellow plume hung out of a battered hat. The
skirt on the inside was a dim green, and little was left of the cotton
velvet jacket but the cotton. A girl of sixteen walking sturdily, like a
little man, crossed the road, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) left hand thrust deep into the pocket of
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) red cashmere dress. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wore on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoulders a strip of beaded
mantle; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair was plaited and tied with a red ribbon. Corpulent women
passed, their eyes liquid with invitation; and the huge bar-loafer, the
man of fifty, the hooked nose and the waxed moustache, stood at the door
of a restaurant, passing the women in review.

<p/>A true London of the water's edge--a London of theatres, music-halls,
wine-shops, public-houses--the walls painted various colours, nailed over
with huge gold lettering; the pale air woven with delicate wire, a
gossamer web underneath which the crowd moved like lazy flies, one half
watching the perforated spire of St. Mary's, and all the City spires
behind it now growing cold in the east, the other half seeing the spire of
St. Martin's above the chimney-pots aloft in a sky of cream pink. Stalwart
policemen urged along groups of slattern boys and girls; and after vulgar
remonstrance these took the hint and disappeared down strange passages.
Suddenly Esther came face to face with a woman whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) recognised as
Margaret Gale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, is it you, Margaret?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is me all right. What are you doing up here? Got tired of
service? Come and have a drink, old gal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you; I'm glad to have seen you, Margaret, but I've a train to
catch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That won't do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Gale/Gale</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) by the arm; <div class="bookquote">``we must have a
drink and a talk over old times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Gale/Gale</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther felt that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not have something she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would faint before she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
reached Ludgate Hill, and Margaret led the way through the public-house,
opening all the varnished doors, seeking a quiet corner. <div class="bookquote">``What's the
matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said, startled at the pallor of Esther's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only a little faintness; I've not had anything to eat all day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quick, quick, four of brandy and some water,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Gale/Gale</b></font>)</div>Margaret cried to the
barman, and a moment after she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was holding the glass to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) friend's lips.
<div class="bookquote">``Not had anything to eat all day, dear? Then we'll have a bite and a sup
together. I feel a bit peckish myself. Two sausages and two rolls and
butter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cried. Then the women had a long talk. Margaret told Esther
the story of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) misfortune.

<p/>The Barfields were all broken up. They had been very unlucky racing, and
when the servants got the sack Margaret had come up to London. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had
been in several situations. Eventually, one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) masters had got her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
into trouble, his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife had turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) out neck and crop, and what was she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
to do? Then Esther told how Master Harry had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) situation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you left like that? Well I never! The better one behaves the worse
one gets treated, and them that goes on with service find themselves in
the end without as much as will buy them a Sunday dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Gale/Gale</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret insisted on accompanying Esther, and they walked together as far
as Wellington Street. <div class="bookquote">``I can't go any further,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and pointing to where
London seemed to end in a piece of desolate sky, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I live on the
other side, in Stamford Street. You might come and see me. If you ever get
tired of service you'll get decent rooms there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Bad weather followed fine, and under a streaming umbrella Esther went from
one address to another, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) damp skirts clinging about her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) boots
clogged with mud. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looked upon the change in the weather as
unfortunate, for in getting a situation so much depended on personal
appearance and cheerfulness of manner; and it is difficult to seem a right
and tidy girl after two miles' walk through the rain.

<p/>One lady told Esther that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) liked tall servants, another said she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) never
engaged good-looking girls, and another place that would have suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
was lost through unconsciously answering that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was chapel. The lady
would have nothing in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) house but church. Then there were the
disappointments occasioned by the letters which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) received from people
who she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought would have engaged her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), saying they were sorry, but that
they had seen some one whom they liked better.

<p/>Another week passed and Esther had to pawn her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) clothes to get money for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) train fare to London, and to keep the registry office supplied with
stamps. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) prospects had begun to seem quite hopeless, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) lay awake
thinking that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) and Jackie must go back to the workhouse. They could not
stop on at Mrs. Lewis's much longer. Mrs. Lewis had been very good to
them, but Esther owed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) two weeks' money. What was to be done? She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had
heard of charitable institutions, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was an ignorant girl and did not
know how to make the necessary inquiries. Oh, the want of a little
money--of a very little money; the thought beat into her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) brain. For just
enough to hold on till the people came back to town.

<p/>One day Mrs. Lewis, who read the newspapers for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>), came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) with an
advertisement which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) said seemed to read like a very likely chance.
Esther looked at the pence which remained out of the last dress that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
had pawned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it will turn out like the others; I'm out of my
luck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lewis</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Lewis; <div class="bookquote">``keep your courage up; I'll stick to
you as long as I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lewis</b></font>)</div><p/>The women had a good cry in each other's arms, and then Mrs. Lewis advised
Esther to take the situation, even if it were no more than sixteen. <div class="bookquote">``A lot
can be done by constant saving, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) gives yer `er dresses and ten
shillings for a Christmas-box, I don't see why you should not pull
through. The baby shan't cost you more than five shillings a week till you
get a situation as plain cook. Here is the address--Miss Rice, Avondale
Road, West Kensington.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>XXII


<p/>Avondale Road was an obscure corner of the suburb--obscure, for it had
just sprung into existence. The scaffolding that had built it now littered
an adjoining field, where in a few months it would rise about Horsely
Gardens, whose red gables and tiled upper walls will correspond
unfailingly with those of Avondale Road. Nowhere in this neighbourhood
could Esther detect signs of eighteen pounds a year. Scanning the Venetian
blinds of the single drawing-room window, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said to herself, <div class="bookquote">``Hot joint
today, cold the next.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) noted the trim iron railings and the spare
shrubs, and raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) saw the tiny gable windows of the
cupboard-like rooms where the single servant kept in these houses slept.

<p/>A few steps more brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to 41, the corner house. The thin passage and
the meagre staircase confirmed Esther in the impression she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had received
from the aspect of the street; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) felt that the place was more
suitable to the gaunt woman with iron-grey hair who waited in the passage.
This woman looked apprehensively at Esther, and when Esther said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
had come after the place a painful change of expression passed over her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
face, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll get it; I'm too old for anything but charing. How much are you
going to ask?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't take less than sixteen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sixteen! I used to get that once; I'd be glad enough to get twelve now.
You can't think of sixteen once you've turned forty, and I've lost my
teeth, and they means a couple of pound off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the door opened, and a woman's voice called to the gaunt woman to
come in. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went in, and Esther breathed a prayer that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) might not be
engaged. A minute intervened, and the gaunt woman came out; there were
tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whispered to Esther as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) passed, <div class="bookquote">``No good; I
told you so. I'm too old for anything but charing.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The abruptness of the
interview suggested a hard mistress, and Esther was surprised to find
herself in the presence of a slim lady, about seven-and-thirty, whose
small grey eyes seemed to express a kind and gentle nature. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) stood
speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), Esther saw a tall glass filled with chrysanthemums and a
large writing-table covered with books and papers. There was a bookcase,
and in place of the usual folding-doors, a bead curtain hung between the
rooms.

<p/>The room almost said that the occupant was a spinster and a writer, and
Esther remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had noticed even at the time Miss Rice's
manuscript, it was such a beautiful clear round hand, and it lay on the
table, ready to be continued the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) should have settled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw your advertisement in the paper, miss; I've come after the
situation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are used to service?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss, I've had several situations in gentlemen's families, and have
excellent characters from them all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Then Esther related the story of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
situations, and Miss Rice put up her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) glasses and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) grey eyes smiled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>)
seemed pleased with the somewhat rugged but pleasant-featured girl before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I live alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``the place is an easy one, and if the wages
satisfy you, I think you will suit me very well. My servant, who has been
with me some years, is leaving me to be married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are the wages, miss?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fourteen pounds a year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid, miss, there would be no use my taking the place; I've so many
calls on my money that I could not manage on fourteen pounds. I'm very
sorry, for I feel sure I should like to live with you, miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But what was the good of taking the place? She (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) could not possibly manage
on fourteen, even if Miss Rice did give her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) a dress occasionally, and that
didn't look likely. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) strength seemed to give way under her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>)
misfortune, and it was with difficulty that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) restrained her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think we should suit each other,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Rice</b></font>)</div>Miss Rice said reflectively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to have you for my servant if I could afford it. How much
would you take?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Situated, as I am, miss, I could not take less than sixteen. I've been
used to eighteen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sixteen pounds is more than I can afford, but I'll think it over. Give me
your name and address.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Esther Waters, 13 Poplar Road, Dulwich.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>As Esther turned to go she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) became aware of the kindness of the eyes that
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). Miss Rice said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid you're in trouble... Sit down; tell me about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Rice</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, miss, what's the use?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Rice</b></font>)</div>But Miss Rice looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) so kindly that
Esther could not restrain herself. <div class="bookquote">``There's nothing for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``but to go back to the workhouse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why should you go to the workhouse? I offer you fourteen pounds a
year and everything found.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, miss, I've a baby; we've been in the workhouse already; I had to
go there the night I left my situation, to get him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) away from Mrs. Spires;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) wanted to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>)'d have done it for five pounds--that's the
price. But, miss, my story is not one that can be told to a lady such as
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I'm old enough to listen to your story; sit down, and tell it to
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Rice</b></font>)</div><p/>And all the while Miss Rice's eyes were filled with tenderness and pity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A very sad story--just such a story as happens every day. But you have
been punished, you have indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss, I think I have; and after all these years of striving it is
hard to have to take him (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) back to the workhouse. Not that I want to give
out that I was badly treated there, but it is the child I'm thinking of.
He (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was then a little baby and it didn't matter; we was only there a few
months. There's no one that knows of it but me. But he (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s a growing boy
now, he (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'ll remember the workhouse, and it will be always a disgrace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How old is he (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was six last May, miss. It has been a hard job to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) up. I now
pay six shillings a week for him (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), that's more than fourteen pounds a year,
and you can't do much in the way of clothes on two pounds a year. And now
that he (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s growing up he (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s costing more than ever; but Mrs. Lewis--that's
the woman what has brought him (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) up--is as fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as I am myself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>)
don't want to make nothing out of his (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) keep, and that's how I've managed up
to the present. But I see well enough that it can't be done; his (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) expense
increases, and the wages remains the same. It was my pride to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) up
on my earnings, and my hope to see him (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) an honest man earning good money.
But it wasn't to be, miss, it wasn't to be. We must be humble and go back
to the workhouse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can see that it has been a hard fight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has indeed, miss; no one will ever know how hard. I shouldn't mind if
it wasn't going to end by going back to where it started... They'll take
him (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) from me; I shall never see him (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is there. I wish I was dead,
miss, I can't bear my trouble no longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shan't go back to the workhouse so long as I can help you. Esther,
I'll give you the wages you ask for. It is more than I can afford.
Eighteen pounds a year! But your child shall not be taken from you. You
shall not go to the workhouse. There aren't many such good women in the
world as you, Esther.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Rice</b></font>)</div><p/>XXIII


<p/>From the first Miss Rice was interested in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) servant, and encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>)
confidences. But it was some time before either was able to put aside her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>)
natural reserve. They were not unlike--quiet, instinctive Englishwomen,
strong, warm natures, under an appearance of formality and reserve.

<p/>The instincts of the watch-dog soon began to develop in Esther, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
extended her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) supervision over all the household expenses, likewise over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mistress's health.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, miss, I must `ave you take your soup while it is `ot. You'd better
put away your writing; you've been at it all the morning. You'll make
yourself ill, and then I shall have the nursing of you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Rice</b></font>)</div>If Miss Rice were
going out in the evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) would find herself stopped in the passage.
<div class="bookquote">``Now, miss, I really can't see you go out like that; you'll catch your
death of cold. You must put on your warm cloak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Rice</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Rice's friends were principally middle-aged ladies. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) sisters,
large, stout women, used to come and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>), and there was a
fashionably-dressed young man whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) mistress seemed to like very much.
Mr. Alden was his (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>) name, and Miss Rice told Esther that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>), too, wrote
novels; they used to talk about each other's books for hours, and Esther
feared that Miss Rice was giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) heart away to one who did not care
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>). But perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) was satisfied to see Mr. Alden once a week and
talk for an hour with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>) about books. Esther didn't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)'d care, if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had a young man, to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) come and go like a shadow. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hadn't
a young man, and did not want one. All she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) now wanted was to awake in the
morning and know that her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) child was safe; her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) ambition was to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
mistress's life comfortable. And for more than a year she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) plan
of life unswervingly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) declined an offer of marriage, and was rarely
persuaded into a promise to walk out with any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) admirers. One of
these was a stationer's foreman, and almost every day Esther went to the
stationer's for the sermon paper on which her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mistress wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) novels,
for blotting-paper, for stamps, to post letters--that shop seemed the
centre of their lives.

<p/>Fred Parsons--that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Parsons</b></font>) name--was a meagre little man about
thirty-five. A high and prominent forehead rose above a small pointed
face, and a scanty growth of blonde beard and moustache did not conceal
the receding chin nor the red sealing-wax lips. His (<font color='blue'><b>Parsons</b></font>) faded yellow hair was
beginning to grow thin, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Parsons</b></font>) threadbare frock-coat hung limp from
sloping shoulders. But these disadvantages were compensated by a clear
bell-like voice, into which no trace of doubt ever seemed to come; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Parsons</b></font>)
mind was neatly packed with a few religious and political ideas. He (<font color='blue'><b>Parsons</b></font>) had
been in business in the West End, but an uncontrollable desire to ask
every customer who entered into conversation with him (<font color='blue'><b>Parsons</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Parsons</b></font>) were sure that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Parsons</b></font>) believed in the second coming of Christ had been the cause of severance
between him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) employers.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) had been at West Kensington a fortnight, had served Esther once with
sermon paper, and had already begun to wonder what were her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) religious
beliefs. But bearing in mind his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) recent dismissal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) refrained for the
present. At the end of the week they were alone in the shop. Esther had
come for a packet of note-paper. Fred was sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had not come for
sermon paper; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had it would have been easier to inquire her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) opinions
regarding the second coming. But the opportunity, such as it was, was not
to be resisted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your mistress seems to use a great deal of paper; it was only a day or
two ago that I served you with four quires.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was for her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) books; what she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) now wants is note-paper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So your mistress writes books!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope they're good books--books that are helpful.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) paused to see that
no one was within earshot. <div class="bookquote">``Books that bring sinners back to the Lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) writes; I only know she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) writes books; I think I've
heard she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) writes novels.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Parsons/Parsons</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred did not approve of novels--Esther could see that--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was sorry;
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) seemed a nice, clear-spoken young man, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would have liked to
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mistress was the last person who would write anything
that could do harm to anyone. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mistress was waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) paper,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) took leave of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) hastily. The next time they met was in the
evening. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was going to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) could get some fresh eggs for her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
mistress's breakfast before the shops closed, and coming towards her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>),
walking at a great pace, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) saw one whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) recognised, a
meagre little man with long reddish hair curling under the brim of a large
soft black hat. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nodded, smiling pleasantly as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passed her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lor',''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``I didn't know him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>); it's the stationer's foreman.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And the very next evening they met in the same street; she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was out for a
little walk, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was hurrying to catch his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) train. They stopped to pass the
time of day, and three days after they met at the same time, and as nearly
as possible at the same place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're always meeting,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, isn't it strange?... You come this way from business?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; about eight o'clock is my time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the end of August; the stars caught fire slowly in the murky London
sunset; and, vaguely conscious of a feeling of surprise at the pleasure
they took in each other's company, they wandered round a little bleak
square in which a few shrubs had just been planted. They took up the
conversation exactly at the point where it had been broken off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Parsons/Parsons</b></font>)</div>Fred said, <div class="bookquote">``that the paper isn't going to be put to better
use.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Parsons/Parsons</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know my mistress, or you wouldn't say that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you don't know that novels are very often stories about the loves
of men for other men's wives. Such books can serve no good purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure my mistress don't write about such things. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), poor
dear innocent lamb? It is easy to see you don't know her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Rice</b></font>)</div><p/>In the course of their argument it transpired that Miss Rice went to
neither church nor chapel.

<p/>Fred was much shocked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you do not follow your mistress's example.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther admitted she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had for some time past neglected her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) religion. Fred
went so far as to suggest that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) ought to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) present situation
and enter a truly religious family.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I owe her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) too much ever to think of leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>). And it has nothing to do
with her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) if I haven't thought as much about the Lord as I ought to have.
It's the first place I've been in where there was time for religion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Parsons/Parsons</b></font>)</div><p/>This answer seemed to satisfy Fred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where used you to go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My people--father and mother--belonged to the Brethren.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To the Close or the Open?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't remember; I was only a little child at the time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm a Plymouth Brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that is strange.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember that it is only through belief in our Lord, in the sacrifice of
the Cross, that we can be saved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I believe that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Parsons/Parsons</b></font>)</div><p/>The avowal seemed to have brought them strangely near to each other, and
on the following Sunday Fred took Esther to meeting, and introduced her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) as
one who had strayed, but who had never ceased to be one of them.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had not been to meeting since she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was a little child; and the bare
room and bare dogma, in such immediate accordance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) own
nature--were they not associated with memories of home, of father and
mother, of all that had gone?--touched her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with a human delight that
seemed to reach to the roots of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) nature. It was Fred who preached; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) spoke of the second coming of Christ, when the faithful would be
carried away in clouds of glory, of the rapine and carnage to which the
world would be delivered up before final absorption in everlasting hell;
and a sensation of dreadful awe passed over the listening faces; a young
girl who sat with closed eyes put out her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand to assure herself that
Esther was still there--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had not been carried away in glory.

<p/>As they walked home, Esther told Fred that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had not been so happy for a
long time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hand, and thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) with a look in which
appeared all his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) soul; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) for ever and ever; nothing could wholly
disassociate them; he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) soul. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) exaltation moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to
wonder. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) own innate faith, though incapable of these exaltations,
had supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) during many a troublous year. Fred would want her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to
come to meeting with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) next Sunday, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was going to Dulwich. Sooner
or later he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) would find out that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had a child, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would see him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) no
more. It were better that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) should tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) than that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) should hear it
from others. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not bear the humiliation, the shame;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wished they had never met. That child came between her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) and every
possible happiness... It were better to break off with Fred. But what
excuse could she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) give? Everything went wrong with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) might ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to
marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), then she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would have to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>).

<p/>Towards the end of the week she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heard some one tap at the window; it was
Fred. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) answered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had not
had time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you come out this evening?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hat, and they went out. Neither spoke, but their feet took
instinctively the pavement that led to the little square where they had
walked the first time they went out together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been thinking of you a good deal, Esther, in the last few days. I
want to ask you to marry me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther did not answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't; I'm very sorry; don't ask me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why can't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I told you I don't think you'd want to marry me. I suppose I'd better
tell you. I'm not the good woman you think me. I've got a child. There,
you have it now, and you can take your hook when you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) blunt, sullen nature that had spoken; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) didn't care if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) on the spot--now he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) knew all and could do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) liked. At last,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you've repented, Esther?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think I had, and been punished too, enough for a dozen
children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, then it wasn't lately?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lately! It's nearly eight year ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And all that time you've been a good woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think I've been that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then if--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want no ifs. If I am not good enough for you, you can go
elsewhere and get better; I've had enough of reproaches.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not mean to reproach you; I know that a woman's path is more
difficult to walk in than ours. It may not be a woman's fault if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
falls, but it is always a man's. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can always fly from temptation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet there isn't a man that can say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hasn't gone wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not all, Esther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther looked him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) full in the face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand what you mean, Esther, but I can honestly say that I never
have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther did not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) any better for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) purity, and was irritated by
the clear tones of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) icy voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But that is no reason why I should be hard on those who have not been so
fortunate. I didn't mean to reproach you just now, Esther; I only meant to
say that I wish you had told me this before I took you to meeting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you're ashamed of me, is that it? Well, you can keep your shame to
yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not that, Esther--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you'd like to see me humiliated before the others, as if I haven't
had enough of that already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Esther, listen to me. Those who transgress the moral law may not
kneel at the table for a time, until they have repented; but those who
believe in the sacrifice of the Cross are acquitted, and I believe you do
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A sinner that repenteth--I will speak about this at our next meeting;
you will come with me there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Next Sunday I'm going to Dulwich to see the child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you go after meeting?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I can't be out morning and afternoon both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I go with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Dulwich!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't go until after meeting; I can meet you at the railway station.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>As they walked home Esther told Fred the story of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) betrayal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was
interested in the story, and was very sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I love you, Esther; it is easy to forgive those we love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're very good; I never thought to find a man so good.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looked up
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) face; her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hand was on the gate, and in that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) felt that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) almost loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>).




<p/>XXIV


<p/>Mrs. Humphries, an elderly person, who looked after a bachelor's
establishment two doors up, and generally slipped in about tea-time, soon
began to speak of Fred as a very nice young man who would be likely to
make a woman happy. But Esther moved about the kitchen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) taciturn
way, hardly answering. Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) told Mrs. Humphries that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had been
to Dulwich with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and that it was wonderful how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and Jackie had taken
to one another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't say so! Well, it is nice to find them religious folks less
`ard-`earted than they gets the name of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Humphries</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Humphries was of the opinion that henceforth Esther should give
herself out as Jackie's aunt. <div class="bookquote">``None believes them stories, but they make
one seem more respectable like, and I am sure Mr. Parsons will appreciate
the intention.''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther did not answer, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thought of what Mrs.
Humphries had said. Perhaps it would be better if Jackie were to leave off
calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) Mummie. Auntie! But no, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) could not bear it. Fred must take
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) was or not at all. They seemed to understand each other; he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was
earning good money, thirty shillings a week, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) was now going on for
eight-and-twenty; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) was ever going to be married it was time to think
about it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know how that dear soul will get on without me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) said one
October morning as they jogged out of London by a slow train from St.
Paul's. Fred was taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) into Kent to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) people.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you expect me to get on without you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Trust you to manage somehow. There ain't much fear of a man not looking
after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little self.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the old folk will want to know when. What shall I tell them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This time next year; that'll be soon enough. Perhaps you'll get tired of
me before then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say next spring, Esther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The train stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's father waiting for us in the spring-cart. Father! He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) don't hear
us. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'s gone a bit deaf of late years. Father!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, so here you are. Train late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is Esther, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>They were going to spend the day at the farm-house, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was going to
be introduced to Fred's sisters and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) brother. But these did not
concern her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) much, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thoughts were set on Mrs. Parsons, for Fred had
spoken a great deal about his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mother. When she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been told about Jackie
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) was of course very sorry; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) had heard the whole of Esther's
story she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had said, <div class="bookquote">``We are all born into temptation, and if your Esther
has really repented and prayed to be forgiven, we must not say no to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Nevertheless Esther was not quite easy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mind, and half regretted
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had consented to see Fred's people until he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
wife. But it was too late to think of such things. There was the
farm-house. Fred had just pointed it out, and scenting his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) stable, the old
grey ascended the hill at a trot, and Esther wondered what the farm-house
would be like. All the summer they had had a fine show of flowers, Fred
said. Now only a few Michaelmas daisies withered in the garden, and the
Virginia creeper covered one side of the house with a crimson mantle. The
old man said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would take the trap round to the stable, and Fred walked
up the red-bricked pavement and lifted the latch. As they passed through
the kitchen Fred introduced Esther to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) two sisters, Mary and Lily. But
they were busy cooking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother is in the parlour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Mary/Mary</b></font>)</div>said Mary; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) is waiting for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Mary/Mary</b></font>)</div>By the
window, in a wide wooden arm-chair, sat a large woman about sixty, dressed
in black. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wore on either side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) long white face two corkscrew
curls, which gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a somewhat ridiculous appearance. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ceased to
be ridiculous or grotesque when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) chair to greet her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) son.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face beamed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hands in a beautiful gesture of
welcome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how do you do, dear Fred? I am that glad to see you! How good of you
to come all this way! Come and sit down here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, this is Esther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do, Esther? It was good of you to come. I am glad to see you.
Let me get you a chair. Take off your things, dear; come and sit down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) insisted on relieving Esther of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hat and jacket, and, having laid
them on the sofa, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) waddled across the room, drawing over two chairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and sit down; you'll tell me everything. I can't get about much now,
but I like to have my children round me. Take this chair, Esther.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Parsons/Parsons</b></font>)</div>Then
turning to Fred, <div class="bookquote">``Tell me, Fred, how you've been getting on. Are you still
living at Hackney?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Parsons/Parsons</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mother; but when we're married we're going to have a cottage at
Mortlake. Esther will like it better than Hackney. It is nearer the
country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you've not forgotten the country. Mortlake is on the river, I think.
I hope you won't find it too damp.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, mother, there are some nice cottages there. I think we shall find
that Mortlake suits us. There are many friends there; more than fifty meet
together every Sunday. And there's a lot of political work to be done
there. I know that you're against politics, but men can't stand aside
nowadays. Times change, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So long as we have God in our hearts, my dear boy, all that we do is
well. But you must want something after your journey. Fred, dear, knock at
that door. Your sister Clara's dressing there. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) to make haste.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>cried a voice from behind the partition which
separated the rooms, and a moment after the door opened and a young woman
about thirty entered. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was better-looking than the other sisters, and
the fashion of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) skirt, and the worldly manner with which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
brother and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand to Esther, marked her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) off at once from the rest
of the family. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was forewoman in a large millinery establishment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
spent Saturday afternoon and Sunday at the farm, but to-day she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had got
away earlier, and with the view to impressing Esther, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) explained how
this had come about.

<p/>Mrs. Parsons suggested a glass of currant wine, and Lily came in with a
tray and glasses. Clara said she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was starving. Mary said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would have to
wait, and Lily whispered, <div class="bookquote">``In about half-an-hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lily</b></font>)</div><p/>After dinner the old man said that they must be getting on with their work
in the orchard. Esther said she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would be glad to help, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was
about to follow the others Mrs. Parsons detained her (<font color='blue'><b>Parsons</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mind staying with me a few minutes, do you, dear? I shan't keep
you long.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Parsons</b></font>) drew over a chair for Esther. <div class="bookquote">``I shan't perhaps see you
again for some time. I am getting an old woman, and the Lord may be
pleased to take me at any moment. I wanted to tell you, dear, that I put
my trust in you. You will make a good wife to Fred, I feel sure, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
will make a good father to your child, and if God blesses you with other
children he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'ll treat your first no different than the others. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s told me
so, and my Fred is a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) word. You were led into sin, but you've
repented. We was all born into temptation, and we must trust to the Lord
to lead us out lest we should dash our foot against a stone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was to blame; I don't say I wasn't, but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We won't say no more about that. We're all sinners, the best of us.
You're going to be my son's wife; you're therefore my daughter, and this
house is your home whenever you please to come to see us. And I hope that
that will be often. I like to have my children about me. I can't get about
much now, so they must come to me. It is very sad not to be able to go to
meeting. I've not been to meeting since Christmas, but I can see them
going there from the kitchen window, and how `appy they look coming back
from prayer. It is easy to see that they have been with God. The
Salvationists come this way sometimes. They stopped in the lane to sing. I
could not hear the words, but I could see by their faces that they was
with God... Now, I've told you all that was on my mind. I must not keep
you; Fred is waiting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther kissed the old woman, and went into the orchard, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) found
Fred on a ladder shaking the branches. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) came down when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) saw Esther,
and Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) brother, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) place. Esther and Fred filled one basket,
then, yielding to a mutual inclination, they wandered about the orchard,
stopping on the little plank bridge. They hardly spoke at all, words
seemed unnecessary; each felt happiness to be in the other's presence.
They heard the water trickling through the weeds, and as the light waned
the sound of the falling apples grew more distinct. Then a breeze shivered
among the tops of the apple-trees, and the sered leaves were blown from
the branches. The voices of the gatherers were heard crying that their
baskets were full. They crossed the plank bridge, joking the lovers, who
stood aside to let them pass.

<p/>When they entered the house they saw the old farmer, who had slipped in
before them, sitting by his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) wife holding her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand, patting it in a curious
old-time way, and the attitude of the old couple was so pregnant with
significance that it fixed itself on Esther's mind. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had never seen anything so beautiful. So they had lived for forty
years, faithful to each other, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wondered if Fred forty years hence
would be sitting by her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) side holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hand.

<p/>The old man lighted a lantern and went round to the stable to get a trap
out. Driving through the dark country, seeing village lights shining out
of the distant solitudes, was a thrilling adventure. A peasant came like a
ghost out of the darkness; he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) stepped aside and called, <div class="bookquote">``Good-night!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which the old farmer answered somewhat gruffly, while Fred answered in a
ringing, cheery tone. Never had Esther spent so long and happy a day.
Everything had combined to produce a strange exaltation of the spirit in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) listened to Fred more tenderly than she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had done before.

<p/>The train rattled on through suburbs beginning far away in the country;
rattled on through suburbs that thickened at every mile; rattled on
through a brick entanglement; rattled over iron bridges, passed over deep
streets, over endless lines of lights.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) good-bye at the area gate, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) that they
should be married in the spring. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had gone away with a light heart. And
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had run upstairs to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) dear mistress of the happy day which her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
kindness had allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to spend in the country. And Miss Rice had laid
the book she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) was reading on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) knees, and had listened to Esther's
pleasures as if they had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) own.




<p/>XXV


<p/>But when the spring came Esther put Fred off till the autumn, pleading as
an excuse that Miss Rice had not been very well lately, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) did
not like to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>).

<p/>It was one of those long and pallid evenings at the end of July, when the
sky seems as if it could not darken. The roadway was very still in its
dust and heat, and Esther, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) print dress trailing, watched a poor horse
striving to pull a four-wheeler through the loose heavy gravel that had
just been laid down. So absorbed was she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) pity for the poor animal
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not see the gaunt, broad-shouldered man coming towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>),
looking very long-legged in a pair of light grey trousers and a black
jacket a little too short for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked with long, even strides, a
small cane in one hand, the other in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trousers pocket; a heavy gold
chain showed across his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waistcoat. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore a round hat and a red necktie.
The side whiskers and the shaven upper lip gave him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) the appearance of a
gentleman's valet. He (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) did not notice Esther, but a sudden step taken
sideways as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) lingered, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes fixed on the cab-horse, brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
nearly into collision with him (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do look where you are going to,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) exclaimed, jumping back to avoid the
beer-jug, which fell to the ground. <div class="bookquote">``What, Esther, is it you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, you have made me drop the beer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Plenty more in the public; I'll get you another jug.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very kind of you. I can get what I want myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>They looked at each other, and at the end of a long silence William said:
<div class="bookquote">``Just fancy meeting you, and in this way! Well I never! I am glad to see
you again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you really! Well, so much for that--your way and mine aren't the
same. I wish you good evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop a moment, Esther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And my mistress waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) dinner. I've to go and get some more
beer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I wait for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait for me! I should think not, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther ran down the area steps. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hand paused as it was about to lift
the jug down from the dresser, and a number of thoughts fled across her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
mind. That man would be waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) outside. What was she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to do? How
unfortunate! If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continued to come after her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and Fred would be sure
to meet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you waiting for, I should like to know?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) cried, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) came
up the steps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's `ardly civil, Esther, and after so many years too; one would
think--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want none of your thinking; get out of my sight. Do you `ear? I want no
truck with you whatever. Haven't you done me enough mischief already?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be quiet; listen to me. I'll explain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want none of your explanation. Go away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) whole nature was now in full revolt, and quick with passionate
remembrance of the injustice that had been done her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) drew back from
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes flashing. Perhaps it was some passing remembrance of the
breakage of the first beer-jug that prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) from striking him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with
the second. The spasm passed, and then her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) rage, instead of venting itself
in violent action, assumed the form of dogged silence. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) up
the street, and into the bar. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) handed the jug across the counter, and
while the barman filled it searched in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) pocket for the money. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had
brought none with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). William promptly produced sixpence. Esther answered
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) with a quick, angry glance, and addressing the barman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'll
pay you to-morrow; that'll do, I suppose? 41 Avondale Road.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will be all right, but what am I to do with this sixpence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther said, picking up her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) skirt; <div class="bookquote">``I'll pay
you for what I have had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Holding the sixpence in his (<font color='blue'><b>barman</b></font>) short, thick, and wet fingers, the barman
looked at William. William smiled, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Well, they do run sulky
sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) caught at the leather strap and pulled the door open for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) passed out she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) became aware that William still admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). It was
really too bad, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was conscious of injustice. Having destroyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
life, this man had passed out of sight and knowledge, but only to reappear
when a vista leading to a new life seemed open before her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was that temper of yours that did it; you wouldn't speak to me for a
fortnight. You haven't changed, I can see that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, watching
Esther's face, which did not alter until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke of how unhappy he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
been in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) marriage. <div class="bookquote">``A regular brute she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was--we're no longer together,
you know; haven't been for the last three years; could not put up with
`er. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was that--but that's a long story.''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther did not answer him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) anxiously, and seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would not be won over easily,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look `ere, Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand on the area gate. ``You won't
refuse to come out with me some Sunday. I've a half a share in a
public-house, the ``King's Head,<div class="bookquote">'' and have been backing winners all this
year. I've plenty of money to treat you. I should like to make it up to
you. Perhaps you've `ad rather a `ard time. What `ave yer been doing all
these years? I want to hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What `ave I been doing? Trying to bring up your child! That's what I've
been doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a child, then, is there?''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William, taken aback. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
could recover himself Esther had slipped past him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) down the area into the
house. For a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) were going to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>); on second
thoughts he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had better not. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) lingered a moment and then
walked slowly away in the direction of the Metropolitan Railway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry to `ave kept you waiting, miss, but I met with an accident and
had to come back for another jug.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what was the accident you met with, Esther?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wasn't paying no attention, miss; I was looking at a cab that could
hardly get through the stones they've been laying down in the Pembroke
Road; the poor little horse was pulling that `ard that I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'d drop
down dead, and while I was looking I ran up against a passer-by, and being
a bit taken aback I dropped the jug.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How was that? Did you know the passer-by?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther busied herself with the dishes on the sideboard; and, divining that
something serious had happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) servant, Miss Rice refrained and
allowed the dinner to pass in silence. Half-an-hour later Esther came into
the study with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mistress's tea. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) brought over the wicker table, and
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) set it by her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mistress's knees the shadows about the bookcase and
the light of the lamp upon the book and the pensive content on Miss Rice's
face impelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) own troubles, the hardship, the passion,
the despair of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) life compared with this tranquil existence. Never had
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) felt more certain that misfortune was inherent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>)
remembered all the trouble she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) had had, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) wondered how she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) had come out
of it all alive; and now, just as things seemed like settling, everything
was going to be upset again. Fred was away for a fortnight's holiday--she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>)
was safe for eleven or twelve days. After that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) did not know what might
not happen. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) instinct told her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) that although he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had passed over her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>)
fault very lightly, so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) knew nothing of the father of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) child,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) might not care to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) if William continued to come after her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>). Ah!
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) hadn't happened to go out at that particular time she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) might never
have met William. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) did not live in the neighbourhood; if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) did they
would have met before. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had just settled in the neighbourhood.
That would be worst of all. No, no, no; it was a mere accident; if the
cask of beer had held out a day or two longer, or if it had run out a day
or two sooner, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) might never have met William! But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) could not
keep out of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) way. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) spent the whole day in the street waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>).
If she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) went out on an errand he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) there and back. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>)'d only
listen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) was prettier than ever. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had never cared for any one else.
He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) divorce, and then the child would be
theirs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) did not answer him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), but her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) blood boiled at the word <div class="bookquote">``theirs.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>How could Jackie become their child? Was it not she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) who had worked for
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), brought him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) up? and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) thought as little of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) paternity as if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
had fallen from heaven into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) arms.

<p/>One evening as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) was laying the table her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) grief took her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) unawares, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) was obliged to dash aside the tears that had risen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) eyes. The
action was so apparent that Miss Rice thought it would be an affectation
to ignore it. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) kind, musical, intimate manner, <div class="bookquote">``Esther,
I'm afraid you have some trouble on your mind; can I do anything for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, miss, no, it's nothing; I shall get over it presently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>But the effort of speaking was too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>), and a bitter sob caught
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) in the throat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better tell me your trouble, Esther; even if I cannot help you it
will ease your heart to tell me about it. I hope nothing is the matter
with Jackie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, miss, no; thank God, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s well enough. It's nothing to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>);
leastways--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then with a violent effort she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) put back her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) tears. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, it is
silly of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and your dinner getting cold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to pry into your affairs, Esther, but you know that--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss, I know you to be kindness itself; but there's nothing to be
done but to bear it. You asked me just now if it had anything to do with
Jackie. Well, it is no more than that his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) father has come back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But surely, Esther, that's hardly a reason for sorrow; I should have
thought that you would have been glad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is only natural that you should think so, miss; them what hasn't been
through the trouble never thinks the same as them that has. You see, miss,
it is nearly nine years since I've seen him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and during them nine years I
`ave been through so much. I `ave worked and slaved, and been through all
the `ardship, and now, when the worst is over, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) comes and wants me to
marry him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) gets his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) divorce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you like some one else better?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss, I do, and what makes it so `ard to bear is that for the last
two months or more I've been keeping company with Fred Parsons--that's the
stationer's assistant; you've seen him (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) in the shop, miss--and he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) and me is
engaged to be married. He (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>)'s earning good money, thirty shillings a week;
he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>)'s as good a young man as ever stepped--religious, kind-hearted,
everything as would make a woman `appy in `er `ome. It is `ard for a girl
to keep up with `er religion in some of the situations we have to put up
with, and I'd mostly got out of the habit of chapel-going till I met him (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>);
it was 'e who led me back again to Christ. But for all that, understanding
very well, not to say indulgent for the failings of others, like yourself,
miss. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) knew all about Jackie from the first, and never said nothing
about it, but that I must have suffered cruel, which I have. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)'s been
with me to see Jackie, and they both took to each other wonderful like; it
couldn't `ave been more so if `e'd been `is own father. But now all that's
broke up, for when Fred meets William it is as likely as not as he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)'ll
think quite different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Rice</b></font>)</div><p/>The evening died behind the red-brick suburb, and Miss Rice's strip of
garden grew greener. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) dinner, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) leaned back
thinking of the story she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) had heard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) was one of those secluded maiden
ladies so common in England, whose experience of life is limited to a tea
party, and whose further knowledge of life is derived from the
yellow-backed French novels which fill their bookcases.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How was it that you happened to meet William--I think you said his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) name
was William?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``It was the day, miss, that I went to fetch the beer from the
public-house. It was he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) that made me drop the jug; you remember, miss, I
had to come back for another. I told you about it at the time. When I went
out again with a fresh jug he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was waiting for me, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) followed me to the
``Greyhound' and wanted to pay for the beer--not likely that I'd let him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>); I
told them to put it on the slate, and that I'd pay for it to-morrow. I
didn't speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) on leaving the bar, but he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) followed me to the gate. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
wanted to know what I'd been doing all the time. Then my temper got the
better of me, and I said, <div class="bookquote">``Looking after your child.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My child!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>).

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) speak about the child? Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) ask to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) might like to do something for him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>); perhaps that's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>)'s

between you and the workhouse; you owed Mrs. Lewis two weeks' money for
the support of the child. I daresay you've saved a little money since
you've been with me, but it cannot be more than a few pounds. I don't
think that you ought to let this chance slip through your fingers, if not
for your own, for Jackie's sake. William, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) own account, is
making money. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) may become a rich man; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) has no children by his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) wife; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther ran up the area steps and walked quickly down the street, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
were going on an errand. William crossed the road and was soon alongside
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be so `ard on a chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Just listen to reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) tone was still stubborn, but he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) perceived that it contained a change
of humour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come for a little walk, and then, if you don't agree with what I says,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can speak; no one's preventing you that I can see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say it off like that; it is a long story. I know that I've

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no use nagging; just let's go where we can have a talk, and then

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>William spoke earnestly, and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) words came so evidently from his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) heart
that Esther was touched against her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) will.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I ain't married yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>William and Esther walked on in silence, listening to the day as it hushed
in quiet suburban murmurs. The sky was almost colourless--a faded grey,
that passed into an insignificant blue; and upon this almost neutral tint
the red suburb appeared in rigid outline, like a carving. At intervals the
wind raised a cloud of dust in the roadway. Stopping before a piece of
waste ground, William said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's go in there; we'll be able to talk easier.''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>Esther raised no
objection. They went in and looked for a place where they could sit down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is just like old times,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William, moving a little closer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are going to begin any of that nonsense I'll get up and go. I only

stalk between his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) small, discoloured teeth. The conversation had fallen.
He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) looked at Esther; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sat straight up, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) stiff cotton dress spread
over the rough grass; her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) cloth jacket was unbuttoned. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) a

hankered sorely after his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) son. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) tried to read Esther's quiet, subdued
face. It was graver than usual, and betrayed none of the passion that
choked in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) must manage that the men should not meet. But how
should she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) rid herself of him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and
to lead his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) thoughts away from herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had gone
with his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) wife when they left Woodview. Breaking off suddenly, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Peggy knew all the time I was gone on you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It don't matter about that. Tell me where you went--they said you went
foreign.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We first went to Boulogne, that's in France; but nearly everyone speaks
English there, and there was a nice billiard room handy, where all the big
betting men came in of an evening. We went to the races. I backed three
winners on the first day--the second I didn't do so well. Then we went on
to Paris. The race-meetings is very `andy--I will say that for
Paris--half-an-hour's drive and there you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did your wife like Paris?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) liked it pretty well--it is all the place for fashion, and the
shops is grand; but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) got tired of it too, and we went to Italy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``That's down south. A beast of a place--nothing but sour wine, and all the
cookery done in oil, and nothing to do but seeing picture-galleries. I got
that sick of it I could stand it no longer, and I said, <div class="bookquote">``I've `ad enough
of this. I want to go home, where I can get a glass of Burton and a cut
from the joint, and where there's a horse worth looking at.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Burton</b></font>) was very fond of you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Burton</b></font>) must have been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Burton</b></font>) was, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Burton</b></font>) way. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Burton</b></font>) always liked talking to the singers and the
painters that we met out there. Nothing wrong, you know. That was after we
had been married about three years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What was that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Burton</b></font>) out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know there was anything wrong? Men always think bad of women.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No, it was right enough! she (<font color='blue'><b>Burton</b></font>) had got dead sick of me, and I had got dead
sick of her (<font color='blue'><b>Burton</b></font>). It never did seem natural like. There was no `omeliness in
it, and a marriage that ain't `omely is no marriage for me. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Burton</b></font>) friends
weren't my friends; and as for my friends, she (<font color='blue'><b>Burton</b></font>) never left off insulting me
about them. If I was to ask a chap in she (<font color='blue'><b>Burton</b></font>) wouldn't sit in the same room
with him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>). That's what it got to at last. And I was always thinking of you,
and your name used to come up when we was talking. One day she (<font color='blue'><b>Burton</b></font>) said, ``I
suppose you are sorry you didn't marry a servant?'' and I said, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose
you are sorry you did?'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was a good one for her (<font color='blue'><b>Burton</b></font>). Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Burton</b></font>) say she (<font color='blue'><b>Burton</b></font>) was?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>Burton</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Burton</b></font>) arms round my neck and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Burton</b></font>) loved none but her (<font color='blue'><b>Burton</b></font>) big Bill.
But all her (<font color='blue'><b>Burton</b></font>) flummery didn't take me in. And I says to myself, ``Keep an eye
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Burton</b></font>).<div class="bookquote">'' For there was a young fellow hanging about in a manner I didn't
particularly like. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was too anxious to be polite to me, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) talked to me
about `orses, and I could see he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) knew nothing about them. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) even went so
far as go down to Kempton with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how did it all end?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I determined to keep my eye on this young whipper-snapper, and come up
from Ascot by an earlier train than they expected me. I let myself in and
ran up to the drawing-room. They were there sitting side by side on the
sofa. I could see they were very much upset. The young fellow turned red,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) got up, stammering, and speaking a lot of rot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`What! you back already? How did you get on at Ascot? Had a good day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Rippin'; but I'm going to have a better one now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, keeping my eye
all the while on my wife. I could see by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face that there was no doubt
about it. Then I took him (<font color='blue'><b>Kempton</b></font>) by the throat. <div class="bookquote">``I just give you two minutes to
confess the truth; I know it, but I want to hear it from you. Now, out
with it, or I'll strangle you.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Kempton</b></font>) a squeeze just to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Kempton</b></font>) that
I meant it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kempton</b></font>) turned up his (<font color='blue'><b>Kempton</b></font>) eyes, and my wife cried, <div class="bookquote">``Murder!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>I threw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Kempton</b></font>) back from me and got between her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and the door, locked it, and put the
key in my pocket. <div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``I'll drag the truth out of you both.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kempton</b></font>)
did look white, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kempton</b></font>) shrivelled up by the chimney-piece, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--well, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could have killed me, only there was nothing to kill me
with. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) look at the fire-irons. Then, in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nasty sarcastic way,
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``There's no reason, Percy, why he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) shouldn't know. Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
said, `he (<font color='blue'><b>Kempton</b></font>) is my lover; you can get your divorce when you like.''

<p/>``I was a bit taken aback; my idea was to squeeze it all out of the fellow
and shame him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) before her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) spoilt my little game there, and I could
see by her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) eyes that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had. ``Now, Percy,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, `we'd
better go.''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy</b></font>)</div>That put my blood up. I said, <div class="bookquote">``Go you shall, but not till I
give you leave,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and without another word I took him (<font color='blue'><b>Kempton</b></font>) by the collar and led
him (<font color='blue'><b>Kempton</b></font>) to the door; he (<font color='blue'><b>Kempton</b></font>) came like a lamb, and I sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Kempton</b></font>) off with as fine a
kick as he (<font color='blue'><b>Kempton</b></font>) ever got in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kempton</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kempton</b></font>) went rolling down, and didn't stop
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Kempton</b></font>) got to the bottom. You should have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) look at me; there was
murder in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes. If she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'d have killed me, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) couldn't
and calmed down a bit. <div class="bookquote">``Let me go; what do you want me for? You can get a
divorce... I'll pay the costs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">'''I don't think I'd gratify you so much. So you'd like to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Kempton</b></font>), would
you, my beauty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`He (<font color='blue'><b>Kempton</b></font>)'s a gentleman, and I've had enough of you; if you want money you
shall have it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), and so it went on for an hour or more. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
suddenly calmed down. I knew something was up, only I didn't know what. I
don't know if I told you we was in lodgings--the usual sort, drawing-room
with folding doors, the bedroom at the back. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) went into the bedroom,
and I followed, just to make sure she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) couldn't get out that way. There was
a chest of drawers before the door; I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) couldn't move it, and
went back into the sitting-room. But somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) managed to move it
without my hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), and before I could stop her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was down the
stairs like lightning. I went after her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had too long a start of
me, and the last I heard was the street door go bang.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The conversation paused. William took the stalk he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was chewing from his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
teeth, and threw it aside. Esther had picked one, and with it she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) beat
impatiently among the grass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what has all this to do with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``If this is all you have
brought me out to listen to--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a nice way to round on me. Wasn't it you what asked me to tell you
the story?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you've deserted two women instead of one, that's about the long and
short of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if that's what you think I'd better be off,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) feet and stood looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sat quite still, not daring
to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes; her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heart was throbbing violently. Would he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) go away and
never come back? Should she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) answer him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) indifferently or say nothing? She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
chose the latter course. Perhaps it was the wrong one, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) dogged
silence irritated him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sat down and begged of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heart ceased throbbing, and a cold
numbness came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My wife thought that I had no money, and could do what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) liked with me.
But I had been backing winners all the season, and had a couple of
thousand in the bank. I put aside a thousand for working expenses, for I
intended to give up backing horses and go in for bookmaking instead. I
have been at it ever since. A few ups and downs, but I can't complain. I
am worth to-day close on three thousand pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>At the mention of so much money Esther raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looked at
William steadfastly. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) object was to rid herself of him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
might marry another man; but at that moment a sensation of the love she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
had once felt for him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sprang upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must be getting back, my mistress will be waiting for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't be in that hurry. It is quite early. Besides, we haven't
settled nothing yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've been telling me about your wife. I don't see much what it's got to
do with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you was interested... that you wanted to see that I wasn't as
much to blame as you thought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must be getting back,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``anything else you have to say to me
you can tell me on the way home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it all amounts to this, Esther; if I get a divorce we might come
together again. What do you think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you'd much better make it up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). I daresay she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)'s very sorry
for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)'s done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all rot, Esther. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) ain't sorry, and wouldn't live with me no
more than I with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). We could not get on; what's the use? You'd better
let bygones be bygones. You know what I mean--marry me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I could do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You like some other chap. You like some chap, and don't want me

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've not been through half of what I have. I'll be bound that you never

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Esther, think of the child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a nice one to tell me to think of the child, I who worked and

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you won't let me see the child?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>A moment later Esther answered, <div class="bookquote">``You can see the child, if you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can come with me to see him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) next Sunday, if you like. Now let me go
in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What time shall I come for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About three--a little after.''




 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>XXVI


<p/>William was waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) in the area; and while pinning on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hat she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
thought of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) should say, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) should act. Should she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wanted to marry Fred? Then the long black pin that was to
hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hat to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hair went through the straw with a little sharp sound,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) decided that when the time came she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would know what to say.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) stepped aside to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) go up the area steps, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) noticed how
beautifully dressed he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) wore a pair of grey trousers, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
spick and span morning coat there was a bunch of carnations.

<p/>They walked some half-dozen yards up the street in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why do you want to see the boy? You never thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) all these
years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you, Esther... But it is nice to be walking out with you
again. If you'd only let bygones be bygones we might settle down together
yet. What do you think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not answer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) continued, ``It do seem strange to be walking
out with you again, meeting you after all these years, and I'm never in
your neighbourhood. I just happened to have a bit of business with a
friend who lives your way, and was coming along from his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) `ouse, turning
over in my mind what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had told me about Rising Sun for the Stewards'
Cup, when I saw you coming along with the jug in your `and. I said,
``That's the prettiest girl I've seen this many a day; that's the sort of
girl I'd like to see behind the bar of the <div class="bookquote">``King's Head.'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>' You always
keeps your figure--you know you ain't a bit changed; and when I caught
sight of those white teeth I said, <div class="bookquote">``Lor', why, it's Esther.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought it was about the child you was going to speak to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I am, but you came first in my estimation. The moment I looked into
your eyes I felt it had been a mistake all along, and that you was the
only one I had cared about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then all about wanting to see the child was a pack of lies?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, they weren't lies. I wanted both mother and child--if I could get
'em, ye know. I'm telling you the unvarnished truth, Esther. I thought of
the child as a way of getting you back; but little by little I began to
take an interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), to wonder what he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was like, and with thoughts of
the boy came different thoughts of you, Esther, who is the mother of my
boy. Then I wanted you both back; and I've thought of nothing else ever
since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment they reached the Metropolitan Railway, and William pressed
forward to get the tickets. A subterraneous rumbling was heard, and they
ran down the steps as fast as they could, and seeing them so near the
ticket-collector held the door open for them, and just as the train was
moving from the platform William pushed Esther into a second-class
compartment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're in the wrong class,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, we ain't; get in, get in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) shouted. And with the guard crying to
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to desist, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hopped in after her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), saying, <div class="bookquote">``You very nearly made me
miss the train. What `ud you've done if the train had taken you away and
left me behind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>The remark was not altogether a happy one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you travel second-class?''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I always travel second-class now; Peggy never would, but second
seems to me quite good enough. I don't care about third, unless one is
with a lot of pals, and can keep the carriage to ourselves. That's the way
we manage it when we go down to Newmarket or Doncaster.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were alone in the compartment. William leaned forward and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Try to forgive me, Esther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hand away; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) got up, and sat down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and put his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
arm around her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) waist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no. I'll have none of that. All that sort of thing is over between
us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) inquisitively, not knowing how to act.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you've had a hard time, Esther. Tell me about it. What did you do
when you left Woodview?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) unfortunately added, <div class="bookquote">``Did you ever meet any
one since that you cared for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>The question irritated her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``It don't matter to you who I
met or what I went through.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The conversation paused. William spoke about the Barfields, and Esther
could not but listen to the tale of what had happened at Woodview during
the last eight years.

<p/>Woodview had been all her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) unhappiness and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) misfortune. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had gone
there when the sap of life was flowing fastest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and Woodview had
become the most precise and distinct vision she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had gathered from life.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) remembered that wholesome and ample country house, with its park and
its down lands, and the valley farm, sheltered by the long lines of elms.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) remembered the race-horses, their slight forms showing under the grey
clothing, the round black eyes looking out through the eyelet holes in the
hanging hoods, the odd little boys astride--a string of six or seven
passing always before the kitchen windows, going through the paddock gate
under the bunched evergreens. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) remembered the rejoicings when the horse
won at Goodwood, and the ball at the Shoreham Gardens. Woodview had meant
too much in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) life to be forgotten; its hillside and its people were
drawn out in sharp outline on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mind. Something in William's voice
recalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) reverie, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) say--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The poor Gaffer, 'e never got over it; it regular broke `im up. I forgot
to tell you, it was Ginger who was riding. It appears that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) did all he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>)
knew; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) lost start, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) tried to get shut in, but it warn't no go, luck
was against them; the `orse was full of running, and, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>)
couldn't sit down and saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) blooming `ead off, right in th' middle of
the course, with Sir Thomas's -LRB-that's the `andicapper-RRB- field-glasses on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)'d have been warned off the blooming `eath, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) couldn't afford
that, even to save his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own father. The `orse won in a canter: they clapped
eight stun on him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) for the Cambridgeshire. It broke the Gaffer's `eart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>)
had to sell off his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) `orses, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) died soon after the sale. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) died of
consumption. It generally takes them off earlier; but they say it is in
the family. Miss May--''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, tell me about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther, who had been thinking all the while
of Mrs. Barfield and of Miss Mary. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me, there's nothing the matter
with Miss Mary?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, there is: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) can't live no more in England; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) has to go to
winter, I think it is, in Algeria.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment the train screeched along the rails, and vibrating under
the force of the brakes, it passed out of the tunnel into Blackfriars.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall just be able to catch the ten minutes past four to Peckham,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
said, and they ran up the high steps. William strode along so fast that
Esther was obliged to cry out, <div class="bookquote">``There's no use, William; train or no
train, I can't walk at that rate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>There was just time for them to get their tickets at Ludgate Hill. They
were in a carriage by themselves, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) proposed to draw up the windows
so that they might be able to talk more easily. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was interested in the
ill-luck that had attended certain horses, and Esther wanted to hear about
Mrs. Barfield.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to be very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>); what did she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) do for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything--that was after you went away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad to hear that,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So they spends the summer at Woodview and goes to foreign parts for the
winter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's it. Most of the estate was sold; but Mrs. Barfield, the
Saint--you remember we used to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) the Saint--well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) has her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>)
fortune, about five hundred a year, and they just manage to live there in
a sort of hole-and-corner sort of way. They can't afford to keep a trap,
and towards the end of October they go off and don't return till the
beginning of May. Woodview ain't what it was. You remember the stables
they were putting up when Silver Braid won the two cups? Well, they are
just as when you last saw them--rafters and walls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Racing don't seem to bring no luck to any one. It ain't my affair, but if
I was you I'd give it up and get to some honest work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Racing has been a good friend to me. I don't know where I should be
without it to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So all the servants have left Woodview? I wonder what has become of
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You remember my mother, the cook? She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died a couple of years ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Latch! Oh, I'm so sorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was an old woman. You remember John Randal, the butler? He (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>)'s in a

round and has a glass in the ``King's Head.<div class="bookquote">'' Sarah Tucker--she (<font color='blue'><b>Tucker</b></font>)'s in a

Gale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I met her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) one day in the Strand. I'd had nothing to eat all day. I was
almost fainting, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) took me into a public-house and gave me a
sausage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>The train began to slacken speed, and William said, <div class="bookquote">``This is Peckham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>They handed up their tickets, and passed into the air of an irregular
little street--low disjointed shops and houses, where the tramcars tinkled
through a slacker tide of humanity than the Londoners were accustomed to.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther. <div class="bookquote">``This is the way to the Rye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then Jackie lives at the Rye?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not far from the Rye. Do you know East Dulwich?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I never was here before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Lewis -LRB-that's the woman who looks after him (<font color='blue'><b>Peckham</b></font>)-RRB- lives at East Dulwich,
but it ain't very far. I always gets out here. I suppose you don't mind a
quarter of an hour's walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not when I'm with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>William replied gallantly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
through the passers-by.

<p/>The Rye opened up like a large park, beginning in the town and wending far
away into a country prospect. At the Peckham end there were a dozen
handsome trees, and under them a piece of artificial water where boys were
sailing toy boats, and a poodle was swimming. Two old ladies in black came
out of a garden full of hollyhocks; they walked towards a seat and sat
down in the autumn landscape. And as William and Esther pursued their way
the Rye seemed to grow longer and longer. It opened up into a vast expanse
full of the last days of cricket; it was charming with slender trees and a
Japanese pavilion quaintly placed on a little mound. An upland background
in gradations, interspaced with villas, terraces, and gardens, and steep
hillside, showing fields and hayricks, brought the Rye to a picturesque
and abrupt end.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it ain't nearly so big as Chester race-course. A regular cockpit of a
place is the Chester course; and not every horse can get round it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Turning to the right and leaving the Rye behind them, they ascended a
long, monotonous, and very ugly road composed of artificial little houses,
each set in a portion of very metallic garden. These continued all the way
to the top of a long hill, straggling into a piece of waste ground where
there were some trees and a few rough cottages. A little boy came running
towards them, stumbling over the cinder heaps and the tin canisters with
which the place was strewn, and William felt that that child was his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That child will break `is blooming little neck if 'e don't take care,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
remarked tentatively.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) hated him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to see the child, and to assert her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) complete ownership she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
clasped Jackie to her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) bosom without a word of explanation, and she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
questioned the child on matters about which William knew nothing.

<p/>William stood looking tenderly on his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) son, waiting for Esther to introduce
them. Mother and child were both so glad in each other that they forgot
the fine gentleman standing by. Suddenly the boy looked towards his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
father, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) repented a little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) cruelty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jackie,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``do you know who this gentleman is who has come to see
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) did not care that Jackie should love his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) could not
help feeling sorry for William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm your father,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you ain't. I ain't got no father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know, Jackie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father died before I was born; mother told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But mother may be mistaken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If my father hadn't died before I was born he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d 've been to see us before
this. Come, mother, come to tea. Mrs. Lewis `as got hot cakes, and they'll
be burnt if we stand talking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear, but what the gentleman says is quite true; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is your father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jackie</b></font>)</div><p/>Jackie made no answer, and Esther said, <div class="bookquote">``I told you your father was dead,
but I was mistaken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't you come and walk with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you; I like to walk with mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s always like that with strangers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther; <div class="bookquote">``it is shyness; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll come and talk to you presently, if you leave him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Each cottage had a rough piece of garden, the yellow crowns of sunflowers
showed over the broken palings, and Mrs. Lewis's large face came into the
windowpane. A moment later she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) was at the front door welcoming her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>)
visitors. The affection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) welcome was checked when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) saw that
William was with Esther, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) drew aside respectfully to let this fine
gentleman pass. When they were in the kitchen Esther said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is Jackie's father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, never! I thought--but I'm sure we're very glad to see you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then
noticing the fine gold chain that hung across his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) waistcoat, the cut of
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) clothes, and the air of money which his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) whole bearing seemed to
represent, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) became a little obsequious in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) welcome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure, sir, we're very glad to see you. Won't you sit down?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and
dusting a chair with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) apron, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) handed it to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). Then turning to
Esther, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit yourself down, dear; tea'll be ready in a moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was one of
those women who, although their apron-strings are a good yard in length,
preserve a strange agility of movement and a pleasant vivacity of speech.
<div class="bookquote">``I `ope, sir, we've brought `im up to your satisfaction; we've done the
best we could. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s a dear boy. There's been a bit of jealousy between us
on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) account, but for all that we `aven't spoilt him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I don't want to
praise him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s as well behaved a boy as I knows of. Maybe a bit
wilful, but there ain't much fault to find with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and I ought to know,
for it is I that `ad the bringing up of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) since he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a baby of two
months old. Jackie, dear, why don't you go to your father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) stood by his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother's chair, twisting his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) slight legs in a manner that
was peculiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) dark hair fell in thick, heavy locks over his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
small face, and from under the shadow of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) locks his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) great luminous eyes
glanced furtively at his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) father. Mrs. Lewis told him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to take his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) finger
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mouth, and thus encouraged he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) went towards William, still
twisting his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) legs and looking curiously dejected. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) did not speak for
some time, but he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) allowed William to put his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) arm round him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) and draw him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
against his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) knees. Then fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) eyes on the toes of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) shoes he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said
somewhat abruptly, but confidentially--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you really my father? No humbug, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) added, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
eyes, and for a moment looking William searchingly in the face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not humbugging, Jack. I'm your father right enough. Don't you like
me? But I think you said you didn't want to have a father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jackie</b></font>)</div><p/>Jackie did not answer this question. After a moment's reflection, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``If you be father, why didn't you come to see us before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>William glanced at Esther, who, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) turn, glanced at Mrs. Lewis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid that's rather a long story, Jackie. I was away in foreign
parts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jackie</b></font>)</div><p/>Jackie looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would like to hear about <div class="bookquote">``foreign parts,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and
William awaited the question that seemed to tremble on the child's lips.
But, instead, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) turned suddenly to Mrs. Lewis and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The cakes aren't burnt, are they? I ran as fast as I could the moment I
saw them coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lewis</b></font>)</div><p/>The childish abruptness of the transition made them laugh, and an
unpleasant moment passed away. Mrs. Lewis took the plate of cakes from the
fender and poured out their tea. The door and window were open, and the
dying light lent a tenderness to the tea table, to the quiet solicitude of
the mother watching her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son, knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) in all his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) intimate habits; to
the eager curiosity of the father on the other side, leaning forward
delighted at every look and word, thinking it all astonishing, wonderful.
Jackie sat between the women. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seemed to understand that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chance of
eating as many tea-cakes as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pleased had come, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ate with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes
fixed on the plate, considering which piece he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would have when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
finished the piece he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand. Little was said--a few remarks
about the fine weather, and offers to put out another cup of tea. By their
silence Mrs. Lewis began to understand that they had differences to
settle, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) had better leave them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) shawl from the
peg, and pleaded that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) had an appointment with a neighbour. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>)
wouldn't be more than half-an-hour; would they look after the house till
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) return? And William watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>), thinking of what he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would say when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) was out of hearing. <div class="bookquote">``That boy of ours is a dear little fellow; you've
been a good mother, I can see that. If I had only known.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no use talking no more about it; what's done is done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>child</b></font>)</div><p/>The cottage door was open, and in the still evening they could see their
child swinging on the gate. The moment was tremulous with responsibility,
and yet the words as they fell from their lips seemed accidental.

<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Esther, I can get a divorce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd much better go back to your wife. Once married, always married,
that's my way of thinking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry to hear you say it, Esther. Do you think a man should stop with
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife who's been treated as I have been?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther avoided a direct reply. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) care about the child? He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had
never done anything for him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). William said that if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had known there was a
child he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would have left his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) wife long ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) loved the
child just as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did, and didn't believe in marriage without
children.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That would have been very wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We ain't getting no for`arder by discussing them things,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said,
interrupting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We can't say good-bye after this evening and never see
one another again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? I'm nothing to you now; you've got a wife of your own; you've no
claim upon me; you can go your way and I can keep to mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's that child. I must do something for him (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you can do something for him (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) without ruining me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ruining you, Esther?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ruining me. I ain't going to lose my character by keeping company
with a married man. You've done me harm enough already, and should be
ashamed to think of doing me any more. You can pay for the boy's schooling
if you like, you can pay for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) keep too, but you mustn't think that in
doing so you'll get hold of me again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean it, Esther?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Followers ain't allowed where I am. You're a married man. I won't have
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But when I get my divorce?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When you get your divorce! I don't know how it'll be then. But here's
Mrs. Lewis; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>)'s a-scolding of Jackie for swinging on that `ere gate.
Naughty boy; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s been told twenty times not to swing on the gate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther complained that they had stayed too long, that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
late, and treated his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) questions about Jackie with indifference. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) might
write if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had anything important to say, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) could not keep company
with a married man. William seemed very downcast. Esther, too, was
unhappy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not know why. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had succeeded as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had
expected, but success had not brought that sense of satisfaction which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
had expected it would. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) idea had been to keep William out of the way
and hurry on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) marriage with Fred. But this marriage, once so ardently
desired, no longer gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) any pleasure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had told Fred about the
child. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) remembered that men were very
forgiving before marriage, but how did she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) would not reproach
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) fault the first time they came to disagree about anything?
Ah, it was all misfortune. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had no luck. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) didn't want to marry
anyone.

<p/>That visit to Dulwich had thoroughly upset her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) ought to have kept out
of William's way--that man seemed to have a power over her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hated
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for it. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) want to see the child for? The child was nothing
to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had been a fool; now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d be after the child; and through this
fever of trouble there raged an acute desire to know what Jackie thought
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, what Mrs. Lewis thought of William.

<p/>And the desire to know what was happening became intolerable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) went to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) mistress to ask for leave to go out. Very little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) agitation
betrayed itself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) demeanour, but Miss Rice's sharp eyes had guessed
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) servant's life was at a crisis. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) book on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) knee,
asked a few kind, discreet questions, and after dinner Esther hurried
towards the Underground.

<p/>The door of the cottage was open, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) crossed the little garden she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
heard Mrs. Lewis say--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you must be a good boy, and not go out in the garden and spoil your
new clothes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lewis</b></font>)</div>And when Esther entered Mrs. Lewis was giving the finishing
touches to the necktie which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had just tied. <div class="bookquote">``Now you'll go and sit on
that chair, like a good boy, and wait there till your father comes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, here's mummie,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>cried the boy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) darted out of Mrs. Lewis's
hand. <div class="bookquote">``Look at my new clothes, mummie; look at them!''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>And Esther saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
boy dressed in a suit of velveteen knickerbockers with brass buttons, and
a sky-blue necktie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father--I mean Mr. Latch--came here on Thursday morning, and took him (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>)
to--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Took me up to London--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) back in those clothes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We went to such a big shop in Oxford Street for them, and they took down
many suits before they could get one to fit. Father is that difficult to
please, and I thought we should go away without any clothes, and I
couldn't walk about London with father in these old things. Aren't they
shabby?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) added, kicking them contemptuously. It was a little grey suit
that Esther had made for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) own hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father had me measured for another suit, but it won't be ready for a few
days. Father took me to the Zoological Gardens, and we saw the lions and
tigers, and there are such a lot of monkeys. There is one--But what
makes you look so cross, mummie dear? Don't you ever go out with father in
London? London is such a beautiful place. And then we walked through the
park and saw a lot of boys sailing boats. Father asked me if I had a boat.
I said you couldn't afford to buy me toys. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) said that was hard lines on
me, and on the way back to the station we stopped at a toy-shop and he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)
bought me a boat. May I show you my boat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jackie</b></font>)</div><p/>Jackie was too much occupied with thoughts of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) boat to notice the gloom
that was gathering on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother's face; Mrs. Lewis wished to call upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to desist, but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) could make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) mind what to do, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had
brought the toy from the table and was forcing it into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother's hands.
<div class="bookquote">``This is a cutter-rigged boat, because it has three sails and only one
mast. Father told me it was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'ll be here in half-an-hour; we're going to
sail the boat in the pond on the Rye, and if it gets across all right
he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'ll take me to the park where there's a big piece of water, twice, three
times as big as the water on the Rye. Do you think, mummie, that I shall
ever be able to get my boat across such a piece of water as the--I've
forgotten the name. What do they call it, mummie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't know; don't bother me with your boat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mummie, what have I done that you won't look at my boat? Aren't you
coming with father to the Rye to see me sail it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to go with you. You want me no more. I can't afford to give
you boats... Come, don't plague me any more with your toy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said,
pushing it away, and then in a moment of convulsive passion she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) threw the
boat across the room. It struck the opposite wall, its mast was broken,
and the sails and cords made a tangled little heap. Jackie ran to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) toy,
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) picked it up, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face showed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) grief. <div class="bookquote">``I shan't be able to sail
my boat now; it won't sail, its mast and the sails is broke. Mummie, what
did you break my boat for?''  (<font color='red'><b>child</b></font>)</div>and the child burst into tears. At that moment
William entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the child crying for?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) asked, stopping abruptly on the
threshold. There was a slight tone of authority in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) voice which angered
Esther still more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it to you what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is crying for?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, turning quickly
round. <div class="bookquote">``What has the child got to do with you that you should come down
ordering people about for? A nice sort of mean trick, and one that is just
like you. You beg and pray of me to let you see the child, and when I do
you come down here on the sly, and with the present of a suit of clothes
and a toy boat you try to win his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) love away from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Esther, Esther, I never thought of getting his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) love from you. I meant no
harm. Mrs. Lewis said that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was looking a trifle moped; we thought that
a change would do him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) good, and so--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! it was Mrs. Lewis that asked you to take him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) up to London. It is a
strange thing what a little money will do. Ever since you set foot in this
cottage she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) has been curtseying to you, handing you chairs. I didn't much
like it, but I didn't think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) would round on me in this way.''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>Then
turning suddenly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) old friend, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Who told you to let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
have the child?... Is it he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) or I who pays you for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) keep? Answer me
that. How much did he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) give you--a new dress?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Esther, I am surprised at you: I didn't think it would come to
accusing me of being bribed, and after all these years.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lewis</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Lewis put
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) apron to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) eyes, and Jackie stole over to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It wasn't I who smashed the boat, it was mummie; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)'s in a passion. I
don't know why she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) smashed it. I didn't do nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>William took the child on his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) knee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) didn't mean to smash it. There's a good boy, don't cry no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jackie</b></font>)</div><p/>Jackie looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``Will you buy me another? The shops aren't
open to-day.''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>Then getting off his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) father's knee he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) picked up the toy, and
coming back he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Could we mend the boat somehow? Do you think we
could?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jackie, dear, go away; leave your father alone. Go into the next room,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lewis</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Lewis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) can stop here; let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther. <div class="bookquote">``I want to have no more
to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) can look to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father for the future.''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther turned on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heel and walked straight for the door. But dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) boat with a
cry, the little fellow ran after her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) and clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) skirt despairingly.
<div class="bookquote">``No, mummie dear, you mustn't go; never mind the boat; I love you better
than the boat--I'll do without a boat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Esther, Esther, this is all nonsense. Just listen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I won't listen to you. But you shall listen to me. When I brought you
here last week you asked me in the train what I had been doing all these
years. I didn't answer you, but I will now. I've been in the workhouse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the workhouse!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, do that surprise you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Then jerking out her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) words, throwing them at him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) as if they were
half-bricks, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) the story of the last eight years--Queen
Charlotte's hospital, Mrs. Rivers, Mrs. Spires, the night on the
Embankment, and the workhouse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And when I came out of the workhouse I travelled London in search of
sixteen pounds a year wages, which was the least I could do with, and when
I didn't find them I sat here and ate dry bread. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll tell you--she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) saw
it all. I haven't said nothing about the shame and sneers I had to put up
with--you would understand nothing about that,--and there was more than
one situation I was thrown out of when they found I had a child. For they
didn't like loose women in their houses; I had them very words said about
me. And while I was going through all that you was living in riches with a
lady in foreign parts; and now when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could put up with you no longer,
and you're kicked out, you come to me and ask for your share of the child.
Share of the child! What share is yours, I'd like to know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Esther!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In your mean, underhand way you come here on the sly to see if you can't
steal the love of the child from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) could speak no more; her (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) strength was giving way before the tumult of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) passion, and the silence that had come suddenly into the room was more
terrible than her (<font color='blue'><b>Spires</b></font>) violent words. William stood quaking, horrified, wishing
the earth would swallow him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>); Mrs. Lewis watched Esther's pale face,
fearing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would faint; Jackie, his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) grey eyes open round, held his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
broken boat still in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hand. The sense of the scene had hardly caught on
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) childish brain; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was very frightened; his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) tears and sobs were a
welcome intervention. Mrs. Lewis took him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) arms and tried to soothe
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). William tried to speak; his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) lips moved, but no words came.

<p/>Mrs. Lewis whispered, <div class="bookquote">``You'll get no good out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) now, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) temper's up;
you'd better go. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) don't know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)'s a-saying of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lewis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If one of us has to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William, taking the hint, <div class="bookquote">``there can't be
much doubt which of us.''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) stood at the door holding his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hat, just as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) were going to put it on. Esther stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) back turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). At
last he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Jackie. I suppose you don't want to see me again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>For reply Jackie threw his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) boat away and clung to Mrs. Lewis for
protection. William's face showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was pained by Jackie's refusal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Try to get your mother to forgive me; but you are right to love her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) best.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s been a good mother to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hat and went without
another word. No one spoke, and every moment the silence grew more
paralysing. Jackie examined his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) broken boat for a moment, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) put
it away, as if it had ceased to have any interest for him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). There was no
chance of going to the Rye that day; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) might as well take off his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) velvet
suit; besides, his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother liked him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) better in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) old clothes. When he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
returned his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother was sorry for having broken his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) boat, and appreciated
the cruelty. <div class="bookquote">``You shall have another boat, my darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, leaning
across the table and looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) affectionately; <div class="bookquote">``and quite as good as
the one I broke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you, mummie? One with three sails, cutter-rigged, like that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear, you shall have a boat with three sails.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When will you buy me the boat, mummie--to-morrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As soon as I can, Jackie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>This promise appeared to satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) looked--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is father coming back no more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jackie</b></font>)</div><p/>Jackie hesitated; his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) for an answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if you don't, mummie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was to give you another boat, one with four sails?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They don't have four sails, not them with one mast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was to give you a boat with two masts, would you take it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should try not to, I should try ever so hard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jackie</b></font>)</div><p/>There were tears in Jackie's voice, and then, as if doubtful of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) power
to resist temptation, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) buried his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother's bosom and sobbed
bitterly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall have another boat, my darling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want no boat at all! I love you better than a boat, mummie,
indeed I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what about those clothes? You'd sooner stop with me and wear those
shabby clothes than go to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and wear a pretty velvet suit?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can send back the velvet suit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I? My darling, mummie will give you another velvet suit,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
embraced the child with all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) strength, and covered him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) with kisses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why can't I wear that velvet suit, and why can't father come back?
Why don't you like father? You shouldn't be cross with father because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
gave me the boat. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) didn't mean no harm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you like your father. You like him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) better than me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not better than you, mummie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't like to have any other father except your own real father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How could I have a father that wasn't my own real father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther did not press the point, and soon after Jackie began to talk about
the possibility of mending his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) boat; and feeling that something
irrevocable had happened, Esther put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hat and jacket, and Mrs. Lewis
and Jackie accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) to the station. The women kissed each other on
the platform and were reconciled, but there was a vague sensation of
sadness in the leave-taking which they did not understand. And Esther sat
alone in a third-class carriage absorbed in consideration of the problem
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) life. The life she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had dreamed would never be hers--somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
seemed to know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would never be Fred's wife. Everything seemed to
point to the inevitableness of this end.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had determined to see William no more, but he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) wrote asking how she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
would like him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to contribute towards the maintenance of the child, and
this could not be settled without personal interviews. Miss Rice and Mrs.
Lewis seemed to take it for granted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) would marry William when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
obtained his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) divorce. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was applying himself to the solution of this
difficulty, and professed himself to be perfectly satisfied with the
course that events were taking. And whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) saw Jackie he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) inquired
after his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) father; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hoped, too, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) had forgiven poor father, who
had never meant no harm at all. Day by day she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) saw more clearly that her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>)
instinct was right in warning her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) not to let the child see William, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) had done wrong in allowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) feelings to be overruled by Miss Rice,
who had, of course, advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) for the best. But it was clear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) now
that Jackie never would take kindly to Fred as a stepfather; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) would
never forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) divided him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) real father by marrying
another man. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would grow to dislike his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stepfather more and more; and
when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grew older he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would keep away from the house on account of the
presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stepfather; it would end by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) going to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
would be led into a life of betting and drinking; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) would lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) child
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) married Fred.




<p/>XXVII


<p/>It was one evening as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) was putting things away in the kitchen before
going up to bed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) heard some one rap at the window. Could this be
Fred? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) heart was beating; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) must let him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) in. The area was in
darkness; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) could see no one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is there?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only me. I had to see you to-night on--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) drew an easier breath, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) to come in.

<p/>William had expected a rougher reception. The tone in which Esther invited
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) in was almost genial, and there was no need of so many excuses; but he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
had come prepared with excuses, and a few ran off his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) tongue before he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was
aware.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther, <div class="bookquote">``it is rather late. I was just going up to bed; but
you can tell me what you've come about, if it won't take long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It won't take long... I've seen my solicitor this afternoon, and he (<font color='blue'><b>solicitor</b></font>) says
that I shall find it very difficult to get a divorce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you can't get your divorce?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you glad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean? You must be either glad or sorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said what I mean. I am not given to telling lies.''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther set the large
tin candlestick, on which a wick was spluttering, on the kitchen table,
and William looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) inquiringly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was always a bit of a mystery
to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). And then he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), speaking very quickly, how he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had neglected
to secure proofs of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) wife's infidelity at the time; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had
lived a circumspect although a guilty life ever since, the solicitor
thought that it would be difficult to establish a case against her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) never was guilty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther, unable to resist the
temptation to irritate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not guilty! what do you mean? Haven't I told you how I found them the day
I came up from Ascot?... And didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own up to it? What more proof do
you want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anyway, it appears you haven't enough; what are you going to do? Wait
until you catch her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is nothing else to do, unless--''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>William paused, and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) eyes
wandered from Esther's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Unless what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you see my solicitors have been in communication with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
solicitors, and her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) solicitors say that if it were the other way round,
that if I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) reason to go against me for a divorce, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would be
glad of the chance. That's all they said at first, but since then I've
seen my wife, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) says that if I'll give her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cause to get a divorce
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'ll not only go for it, but will pay all the legal expenses; it won't
cost us a penny. What do you think Esther?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that I understand. You don't mean--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, Esther, that to get a divorce--there's no one who can hear us,
is there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, there's no one in the `ouse except me and the missus, and she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>)'s in

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems that one of the parties must go and live with another party
before either can get a divorce. Do you understand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean that you want me to go and live with you, and perhaps get
left a second time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all rot, Esther, and you knows it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If that's all you've got to say to me you'd better take your hook.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you see, there's the child to consider? And you know well enough,
Esther, that you've nothing to fear; you knows as well as can be that I
mean to run straight this time. So I did before. But let bygones be
bygones, and I know you'd like the child to have a father; so if only for
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sake--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sake! I like that; as if I hadn't done enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Haven't I

child has cost me. Tell me what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s cost you. Not a penny piece--a toy
boat and a suit of velveteen knickerbockers,--and yet you come telling
me--I'd like to know what's expected of me. Is a woman never to think of
herself? Do I count for nothing? For the child's sake, indeed! Now, if it
was anyone else but you. Just tell me where do I come in? That's what I
want to know. I've played the game long enough. Where do I come in? That's
what I want to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no use flying in a passion, Esther. I know you've had a hard
time. I know it was all very unlucky from the very first. But there's no
use saying that you might get left a second time, for you know well enough
that that ain't true. Say you won't do it; you're a free woman, you can
act as you please. It would be unjust to ask you to give up anything more
for the child; I agree with you in all that. But don't fly in a rage with
me because I came to tell you there was no other way out of the
difficulty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can go and live with another woman, and get a divorce that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I can do that; but I first thought I'd speak to you on the subject.

her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) after getting a divorce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You deserted me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why go back on that old story?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It ain't an old story, it's the story of my life, and I haven't come to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you'll have got to the end of it if you'll do what I say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>A moment later Esther said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you want to get a divorce for at all. I daresay your

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s no children, and never will have none, and marriage is a poor

everything else--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I haven't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know all that. I know you've had a damned hard time, Esther. I've had a

shall `ave the `ouse to ourselves, and, working together, I don't think
we'll `ave much difficulty in building it up into a very nice property,
all of which will in time go to the boy. I'm doing pretty well, I told
you, in the betting line, but if you like I'll give it up. I'll never lay
or take the odds again. I can't say more, Esther, can I? Come, say yes,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, reaching his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) arm towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't touch me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said surlily, and drew back a step with air of
resolution that made him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) doubt if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would be able to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Esther--''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>William did not finish. It seemed useless to argue with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) looked at the great red ash of the tallow candle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are the mother of my boy, so it is different; but to advise me to go
and live with another woman! I shouldn't have thought it of a religious
girl like you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Religion! There's very little time for religion in the places I've had to
work in.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Parsons/Parsons</b></font>)</div>Then, thinking of Fred, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) added that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had returned to
Christ, and hoped He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) would forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). William encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to speak of
herself, remarking that, chapel or no chapel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) seemed just as severe
and particular as ever. <div class="bookquote">``If you won't, I can only say I am sorry; but that
shan't prevent me from paying you as much a week as you think necessary
for Jack's keep and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) schooling. I don't want the boy to cost you
anything. I'd like to do a great deal more for the boy, but I can't do
more unless you make him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) my child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I can only do that by going away to live with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The words brought
an instinctive look of desire into her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In six months we shall be man and wife... Say yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't... I can't, don't ask me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're afraid to trust me, is that it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther did not answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can make that all right: I'll settle #500 on you and the child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looked up; the same look was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes, only modified, softened by
some feeling of tenderness which had come into her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heart.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was leaning against the table; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was
sitting on the edge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know that I mean to act rightly by you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then say yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't--it is too late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's another chap?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought as much. Do you care for him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not answer.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not resist; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) could see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was
weeping. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) neck first, and then on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) face; and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
continued to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) loved the other chap. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) signified
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then say yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) murmured that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not. <div class="bookquote">``You can, you can, you
can.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), all the while reiterating, <div class="bookquote">``You can, you can, you
can,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>until it became a sort of parrot cry. Several minutes elapsed, and
the candle began to splutter in its socket. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me go; let me light the gas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sought for the matches she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) caught sight of the clock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not know it was so late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say yes before I go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>And it was impossible to extort a promise from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'm too tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``let me go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) arms and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and said, <div class="bookquote">``My own little wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) went up the area steps she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had used the same
words before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) tried to think of Fred, but William's great square
shoulders had come between her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) and this meagre little man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sighed, and
felt once again that her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) will was overborne by a force which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not
control or understand.




<p/>XXVIII


<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) went round the house bolting and locking the doors, seeing that
everything was made fast for the night. At the foot of the stairs painful
thoughts came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hand across her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was
whelmed with a sense of sorrow, of purely mental misery, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could
not understand, and which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had not strength to grapple with. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was,
however, conscious of the fact that life was proving too strong for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>),
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could make nothing of it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not care
much what happened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had fought with adverse fate, and had conquered in
a way; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had won countless victories over herself, and now found herself
without the necessary strength for the last battle; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had not even
strength for blame, and merely wondered why she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had let William kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) remembered how she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had hated him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hated him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) no longer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
ought not to have spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>); above all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) ought not to have taken
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to see the child. But how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) help it?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) slept on the same landing as Miss Rice, and was moved by a sudden
impulse to go in and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) the story of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) trouble. But what good? No
one could help her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) liked Fred; they seemed to suit each other, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) could have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) a good wife if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) had not met William. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>)
thought of the cottage at Mortlake, and their lives in it; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) sought
to stimulate her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) liking for him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) with thoughts of the meeting-house; she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>)
thought even of the simple black dress she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) would wear, and that life
seemed so natural to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) did not understand why she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) hesitated...
If she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) were to marry William she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) would go to the <div class="bookquote">``King's Head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) would stand behind the bar; she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) would serve the customers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) had
never seen much life, and felt somehow that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) would like to see a little
life; there would not be much life in the cottage at Mortlake; nothing but
the prayer-meeting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) stopped thinking, surprised at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) thoughts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>)
had never thought like that before; it seemed as if some other woman whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hardly knew was thinking for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seemed like one standing at
cross-roads, unable to decide which road she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would take. If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took the
road leading to the cottage and the prayer-meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life would
henceforth be secure. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life from end to end, even to the
time when Fred would come and sit by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and hold her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father and mother sitting side by side. If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took the road to
the public-house and the race-course she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not know what might not
happen. But William had promised to settle #500 on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and Jackie. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>)
life would be secure either way.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) must marry Fred; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) had promised to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) wished to be a
good woman; he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) the life she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) was most fitted for, the life
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) had always desired; the life of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) father and mother, the life of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>)
childhood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) would marry Fred, only--something at that moment seemed to
take her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) by the throat. William had come between her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) and that life. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>)
had not met him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) at Woodview long ago; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) had not met him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) in the
Pembroke Road that night she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) went to fetch the beer for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) mistress's
dinner, how different everything would have been! ...If she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) had met him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
only a few months later, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) was Fred's wife!

<p/>Wishing she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>) might go to sleep, and awake the wife of one or the other, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>)
fell asleep to dream of a husband possessed of the qualities of both, and
a life that was neither all chapel nor all public-house. But soon the one
became two, and Esther awoke in terror, believing she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had married them
both.




<p/>XXIX


<p/>If Fred had said, <div class="bookquote">``Come away with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Parsons/Parsons</b></font>)</div>Esther would have obeyed the
elemental romanticism which is so fixed a principle in woman's nature. But
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) called at the shop he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) only spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) holiday, of the long
walks he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had taken, and the religious and political meetings he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had
attended. Esther listened vaguely; and there was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mind unconscious
regret that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was not a little different. Little irrelevant thoughts came
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would like him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) better if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) wore coloured neckties and a
short jacket; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wished half of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) away--his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) dowdiness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
sandy-coloured hair, the vague eyes, the black neckties, the long loose
frock-coat. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) voice was keen and ringing, and when listening her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
heart always went out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) might fearlessly
entrust her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) life to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) did not seem wholly to understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and
day by day, against her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) will, the thought gripped her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) more and more
closely that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not separate Jackie from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would have
to tell Fred the whole truth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) would not understand it; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
knew. But it would have to be done, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sent round to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)'d like
to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) left business. Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) step round about eight o'clock?

<p/>The clock had hardly struck eight when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heard a tap at the window. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
opened the door and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) came in, surprised by the silence with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
received him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope nothing has happened. Is anything the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, a great deal's the matter. I'm afraid we shall never be married,
Fred, that's what's the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How's that, Esther? What can prevent us getting married?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not
answer, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You've not ceased to care for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, that's not it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jackie's father has come back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've hit it, that's what happened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry that man has come across you again. I thought you told me he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was married. But, Esther, don't keep me in suspense; what has he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down; don't stand staring at me in that way, and I'll tell you the
story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Then in a strained voice, in which there was genuine suffering, Esther
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) story, laying special stress on the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
best to prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) from seeing the child.

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) often used words that Esther did not understand, but guessing his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just what the missus said; she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) argued me into taking him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to see

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can do nothing; no one can do nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, and the tears

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Parsons/Parsons</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred smiled sadly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you won't come?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Esther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They shook hands, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) went out hurriedly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) dashed a tear from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
eyes, and went upstairs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mistress, who had rung for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).

<p/>Miss Rice was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) easy-chair, reading. A long, slanting ray entered the
room; the bead curtain glittered, and so peaceful was the impression that
Esther could not but perceive the contrast between her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) own troublous life
and the contented privacy of this slender little spinster's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it's all over. I've told him (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you, Esther?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Rice</b></font>)</div>said Miss Rice. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) white, delicate hands fell over
the closed volume. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) wore two little colourless rings and a ruby ring
which caught the light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss, I've told him (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) seemed a good deal cut up. I couldn't
help crying myself, for I could have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) a good wife--I'm sure I
could; but it wasn't to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've told him (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) you were going off to live with William?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss; there's nothing like telling the whole truth while you're
about it. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) I was going off to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)'s a very religious young man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) spoke to me about religion, but I told him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) I didn't want
Jackie to be a fatherless boy, and to lose any money he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might have a right
to. It don't look right to go and live with a married man; but you knows,
miss, how I'm situated, and you knows that I'm only doing it because it
seems for the best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) say to that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing much, miss, except that I might get left a second time--and, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wasn't slow to add, with another child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you thought of that danger, Esther?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss, I've thought of everything; but thinking don't change nothing.
Things remain just the same, and you've to chance it in the end--leastways
a woman has. Not on the likes of you, miss, but the likes of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Rice</b></font>)</div>said Miss Rice reflectively, <div class="bookquote">``it is always the woman who is
sacrificed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Rice</b></font>)</div>And her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) thought went back for a moment to the novel she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) was
writing. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) pale and conventional compared with this rough
page torn out of life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) could treat the subject. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>)
passed in review the names of some writers who could do justice to it, and
then her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) eyes went from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) bookcase to Esther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you're going to live in a public-house, Esther? You're going to-night?
I've paid you everything I owe you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss, you have; you've been very kind to me, indeed you have,
miss--I shall never forget you, miss. I've been very happy in your
service, and should like nothing better than to remain on with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All I can say, Esther, is that you have been a very good servant, and I'm
very sorry to part with you. And I hope you'll remember if things do not
turn out as well as you expect them to, that I shall always be glad to do
anything in my power to help you. You'll always find a friend in me. When
are you going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As soon as my box is packed, miss, and I shall have about finished by the
time the new servant comes in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)'s expected at nine; there she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) is,
miss--that's the area bell. Good-bye, miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Rice</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Rice involuntarily held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) hand. Esther took it, and thus
encouraged she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There never was anyone that clear-headed and warm-hearted as yerself,
miss. I may have a lot of trouble, miss... If I wasn't yer servant I'd
like to kiss you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Rice did not answer, and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) was aware, Esther had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) arms and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You're not angry with me, miss; I couldn't
help myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Esther, I'm not angry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go now and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Rice</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Rice walked towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) writing-table, and a sense of the solitude of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) life coming upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) suddenly caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) to burst into tears. It was
one of those moments of effusion which take women unawares. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) new
servant was coming upstairs and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) had to dry her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>Soon after she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) heard the cabman's feet on the staircase as he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) went up for
Esther's box. They brought it down together, and Miss Rice heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) beg
of him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) to be careful of the paint. The girl had been a good and faithful
servant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) was sorry to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>). And Esther was equally sorry
that anyone but herself should have the looking after of that dear, kind
soul. But what could she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) do? She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was going to be married. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not
doubt that William was going to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>); and the cab had hardly entered
the Brompton Road when her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thoughts were fully centred in the life that
awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). This sudden change of feeling surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) excused
herself with the recollection that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had striven hard for Fred, but as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had failed to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), it was only right that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) should think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
husband. Then quite involuntarily the thought sprang upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was
a fine fellow, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) remembered the line of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stalwart figure as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
walked down the street. There would be a parlour behind the bar, in which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would sit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would be mistress of the house. There would be a
servant, a potboy, and perhaps a barmaid.

<p/>The cab swerved round the Circus, and she (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) were capable of
conducting a business like the <div class="bookquote">``King's Head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the end of a fine September evening, and the black, crooked
perspectives of Soho seemed as if they were roofed with gold. A slight
mist was rising, and at the end of every street the figures appeared and
disappeared mysteriously in blue shadow. She (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) had never been in this part
of London before; the adventure stimulated her (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) imagination, and she (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>)
wondered where she (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) was going and which of the many public-houses was hers.
But the cabman jingled past every one. It seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>cabman</b></font>) were never going
to pull up. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>cabman</b></font>) stopped at the corner of Dean Street and Old
Compton Street, nearly opposite a cab rank. The cabmen were inside, having
a glass; the usual vagrant was outside, looking after the horses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Compton</b></font>)
offered to take down Esther's box, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Compton</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Compton</b></font>) had seen
Mr. Latch he (<font color='blue'><b>Compton</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) round to the private bar. The door was pushed open,
and Esther saw William leaning over the counter wrapped in conversation
with a small, thin man. They were both smoking, their glasses were filled,
and the sporting paper was spread out before them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, so here you are at last,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William, coming towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I
expected you an hour ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The new servant was late, and I couldn't leave before she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind; glad you've come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther felt that the little man was staring hard at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was John
Randal, or Mr. Leopold, as they used to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) at Barfield.

<p/>Mr. Leopold shook hands with Esther, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) muttered a <div class="bookquote">``Glad to see you
again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But it was the welcome of a man who regards a woman's presence as
an intrusion, and Esther understood the quiet contempt with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>)
looked at William. <div class="bookquote">``Can't keep away from them,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) face said for one
brief moment. William asked Esther what she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)'d take to drink, and Mr.
Leopold looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) watch and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) must be getting home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Try to come round to-morrow night if you've an hour to spare.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you don't think you'll go to Newmarket?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't think I shall do much in the betting way this year. But come
round to-morrow night if you can; you'll find me here. I must be here
to-morrow night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) said, turning to Esther; <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you presently.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Then the men had a few more words, and William bade John good-night.
Coming back to Esther, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think of the place? Cosy, ain't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But before she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had time
to reply he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You've brought me good luck. I won two `undred and
fifty pounds to-day, and the money will come in very `andy, for Jim
Stevens, that's my partner, has agreed to take half the money on account
and a bill of sale for the rest. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Stevens</b></font>) is; I'll introduce you to him (<font color='blue'><b>Stevens</b></font>).
Jim, come this way, will you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a moment, when I've finished drawing this `ere glass of beer,''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>answered a thick-set, short-limbed man. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) shirt-sleeves, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) crossed the bar wiping the beer from his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me introduce you to a very particular friend of mine, Jim, Miss
Waters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very `appy, I'm sure, to make your acquaintance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Story</b></font>)</div>said Jim, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
extended his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) fat hand across the counter. <div class="bookquote">``You and my partner are, I `ear,
going to take this `ere `ouse off my hands. Well, you ought to make a good
thing of it. There's always room for a `ouse that supplies good liquor.
What can I hoffer you, madam? Some of our whisky has been fourteen years
in bottle; or, being a lady, perhaps you'd like to try some of our best
unsweetened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther declined, but William said they could not leave without drinking
the health of the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Irish or Scotch, ma'am? Mr. Latch drinks Scotch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not avoid taking something, Esther decided that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
would try the unsweetened. The glasses were clinked across the counter,
and William whispered, <div class="bookquote">``This isn't what we sell to the public; this is our
own special tipple. You didn't notice, perhaps, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Scotch</b></font>) took the bottle
from the third row on the left.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment Esther's cabman came in and wanted to know if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was to
have the box taken down. William said it had better remain where it was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I told you I'm not living here; my partner has the upper
part of the house, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Scotch</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Scotch</b></font>)'ll be ready to turn out at the end of
the week. I'm living in lodgings near Shaftesbury Avenue, so we'd better
keep the cab on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther looked disappointed, but said nothing. William said he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)'d stand the
cabby a drink, and, winking at Esther, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Third row on the
left, partner.''




 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>XXX


<p/>The <div class="bookquote">``King's Head''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was an humble place in the old-fashioned style. The
house must have been built two hundred years, and the bar seemed as if it
had been dug out of the house. The floor was some inches lower than the
street, and the ceiling was hardly more than a couple of feet above the
head of a tall man. Nor was it divided by numerous varnished partitions,
according to the latest fashion. There were but three. The private
entrance was in Dean Street, where a few swells came over from the theatre
and called for brandies-and-sodas. There was a little mahogany what-not on
the counter, and Esther served her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) customers between the little shelves.
The public entrance and the jug and bottle entrance were in a side street.
There was no parlour for special customers at the back, and the public bar
was inconveniently crowded by a dozen people. The <div class="bookquote">``King's Head''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was not an
up-to-date public-house. It had, however, one thing in its favour--it was
a free house, and William said they had only to go on supplying good
stuff, and trade would be sure to come back to them. For their former
partner had done them much harm by systematic adulteration, and a little
way down the street a new establishment, with painted tiles and brass
lamps, had been opened, and was attracting all the custom of the
neighbourhood. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was more anxious than William to know what loss the
books showed; she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was jealous of the profits of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) turf account, and when
he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``But you're never here in the daytime, you do
not have these empty bars staring you in the face morning and afternoon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>): a dozen pots of beer about dinner-time, a few
glasses of bitter--there had been a rehearsal over the way--and that was
about all.

<p/>The bars were empty, and the public-house dozed through the heavy heat of
a summer afternoon. Esther sat behind the bar sewing, waiting for Jackie
to come home from school. William was away at Newmarket. The clock struck
five and Jackie peeped through the doors, dived under the counter, and ran
into his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother's arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, did you get full marks to-day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mummie, I got full marks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a good boy--and you want your tea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mummie; I'm that hungry I could hardly walk home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hardly walk home! What, as bad as that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mummie. There's a new shop open in Oxford Street. The window is all
full of boats. Do you think that if all the favourites were to be beaten
for a month, father would buy me one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you was so hungry you couldn't walk home, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, mummie, so I was, but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Well, come this way and have your tea.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) went into the
parlour and rang the bell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mummie, may I have buttered toast?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear, you may.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And may I go downstairs and help Jane to make it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you can do that too; it will save her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) the trouble of coming up. Let
me take off your coat--give me your hat; now run along, and help Jane to
make the toast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther opened a glass door, curtained with red silk; it led from the bar
to the parlour, a tiny room, hardly larger than the private bar, holding
with difficulty a small round table, three chairs, an arm-chair, a
cupboard. In the morning a dusty window let in a melancholy twilight, but
early in the afternoon it became necessary to light the gas. Esther took a
cloth from the cupboard, and laid the table for Jackie's tea. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) came up
the kitchen stairs telling Jane how many marbles he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had won, and at that
moment voices were heard in the bar.

<p/>It was William, tall and gaunt, buttoned up in a grey frock-coat, a pair
of field glasses slung over his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) shoulders. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was with his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) clerk, Ted
Blamy, a feeble, wizen little man, dressed in a shabby tweed suit, covered
with white dust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put that bag down, Teddy, and come and have a drink.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther saw at once that things had not gone well with him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have the favourites been winning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, every bloody one. Five first favourites straight off the reel, three
yesterday, and two second favourites the day before. By God, no man can
stand up against it. Come, what'll you have to drink, Teddy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little whisky, please, guv`nor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div><p/>The men had their drink. Then William told Teddy to take his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) bag upstairs,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) followed Esther into the parlour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could see that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had been
losing heavily, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) refrained from asking questions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Jackie, you keep your father company; tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) how you got on at
school. I'm going downstairs to look after his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you mind about my dinner, Esther, don't you trouble; I was thinking
of dining at a restaurant. I'll be back at nine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll see nothing of you. We've hardly spoken to one another this
week; all the day you're away racing, and in the evening you're talking to
your friends over the bar. We never have a moment alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes, Esther, I know; but the truth is, I'm a bit down in the mouth. I've
had a very bad week. The favourites has been winning, and I overlaid my
book against Wheatear; I'd heard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was as safe as `ouses. I'll meet
some pals down at the <div class="bookquote">``Cri'; it will cheer me up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Seeing how disappointed she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hesitated, and asked what there was
for dinner. <div class="bookquote">``A sole and a nice piece of steak; I'm sure you'll like it.
I've a lot to talk to you about. Do stop, Bill, to please me.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was
very winning in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) quiet, grave way, so he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) arms, kissed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and said he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would stop, that no one could cook a sole as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could,
that it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) an appetite to think of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And may I stop with father while you are cooking his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dinner?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jackie</b></font>)</div>said
Jackie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you can do that; but you must go to bed when I bring it upstairs. I
want to talk with father then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jackie</b></font>)</div><p/>Jackie seemed quite satisfied with this arrangement, but when Esther came
upstairs with the sole, and was about to hand him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) over to Jane, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) begged
lustily to be allowed to remain until father had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fish. <div class="bookquote">``It
won't matter to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``you've to go downstairs to fry the steak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) came up with the steak he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was unwilling as ever to leave. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must go to bed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) tone that argument was
useless. As a last consolation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) promised him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would come
upstairs and kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went to sleep.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will come, won't you, mummie? I shan't go to sleep till you do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther and William both laughed, and Esther was pleased, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was still
a little jealous of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) love for his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jackie</b></font>)</div>Jackie cried to Jane, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) ran upstairs, chattering to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jackie</b></font>)
about the toys he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had seen in Oxford Street. Charles was lighting the gas,
and Esther had to go into the bar to serve some customers. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
returned, William was smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) pipe. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) dinner had had its effect, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
had forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) losses, and was willing to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) the news. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had a
bit of news for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had seen Ginger; Ginger had come up as cordial as
you like, and had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) what price he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was laying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bet with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I laid him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ten pounds to five.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>Once more William began to lament his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) luck. <div class="bookquote">``You'll have better luck
to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginger</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``The favourites can't go on winning. Tell me about
Ginger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There isn't much to tell. We'd a little chat. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew all about the
little arrangement, the five hundred, you know, and laughed heartily.
Peggy's married. I've forgotten the chap's name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The one that you kicked downstairs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>); I can't think of it. No matter, Ginger remembered you; he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)
wished us luck, took the address, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'d come in to-night to see
you if he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) possibly could. I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s been doing too well lately,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) had he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'d been more stand-offish. I saw Jimmy White--you remember
Jim, the little fellow we used to call the Demon, 'e that won the
Stewards' Cup on Silver Braid?... Didn't you and 'e `ave a tussle together
at the end of dinner--the first day you come down from town?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The second day it was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're right, it was the second day. The first day I met you in the
avenue I was leaning over the railings having a smoke, and you come along
with a heavy bundle and asked me the way. I wasn't in service at that
time. Good Lord, how time does slip by! It seems like yesterday... And
after all those years to meet you as you was going to the public for a jug
of beer, and `ere we are man and wife sitting side by side in our own
`ouse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther had been in the <div class="bookquote">``King's Head''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>now nearly a year. The first Mrs.
Latch had got her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) divorce without much difficulty; and Esther had begun to
realise that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had got a good husband long before they slipped round to
the nearest registry office and came back man and wife.

<p/>Charles opened the door. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Randal is in the bar, sir, and would like to
have a word with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William. <div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) I'm coming into the bar presently.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>Charles withdrew. <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William, lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``that
the old chap is in a bad way. He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s been out of a place a long while, and
will find it `ard to get back again. Once yer begin to age a bit, they
won't look at you. We're both well out of business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Randal sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) favourite corner by the wall, smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) clay. He (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>)
wore a large frock-coat, vague in shape, pathetically respectable. The
round hat was greasy round the edges, brown and dusty on top. The shirt
was clean but unstarched, and the thin throat was tied with an old black
silk cravat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) looked himself, the old servant out of situation--the old
servant who would never be in situation again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Been `aving an `ell of a time at Newmarket,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William; <div class="bookquote">``favourites
romping in one after the other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw that the favourites had been winning. But I know of something, a
rank outsider, for the Leger. I got the letter this morning. I thought I'd
come round and tell yer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much obliged, old mate, but it don't do for me to listen to such tales;
we bookmakers must pay no attention to information, no matter how correct
it may be... Much obliged all the same. What are you drinking?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've not finished my glass yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) tossed off the last mouthful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The same?''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>William drew two glasses of porter. <div class="bookquote">``Here's luck.''  (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div>The men nodded, drank,
and then William turned to speak to a group at the other end of the bar.
<div class="bookquote">``One moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Waters</b></font>)</div>John said, touching William on the shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``It is the best
tip I ever had in my life. I `aven't forgotten what I owe you, and if this
comes off I'll be able to pay you all back. Lay the odds, twenty
sovereigns to one against--''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Waters</b></font>)</div>Old John looked round to see that no one was
within ear-shot, then he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) leant forward and whispered the horse's name in
William's ear. William laughed. <div class="bookquote">``If you're so sure about it as all that,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'd sooner lend you the quid to back the horse elsewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you lend me a quid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lend you a quid and five first favourites romping in one after
another!--you must take me for Baron Rothschild. You think because I've a
public-house I'm coining money; well, I ain't. It's cruel the business we
do here. You wouldn't believe it, and you know that better liquor can't be
got in the neighbourhood.''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Waters</b></font>)</div>Old John listened with the indifference of a
man whose life is absorbed in one passion and who can interest himself
with nothing else. Esther asked him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) after Mrs. Randal and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) children,
but conversation on the subject was always disagreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
passed it over with few words. As soon as Esther moved away he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) leant
forward and whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Lay me twelve pounds to ten shillings. I'll be
sure to pay you; there's a new restaurant going to open in Oxford Street
and I'm going to apply for the place of headwaiter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but will you get it?''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>William answered brutally. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) did not mean to
be unkind, but his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) nature was as hard and as plain as a kitchen-table. The
chin dropped into the unstarched collar and the old-fashioned necktie, and
old John continued smoking unnoticed by any one. Esther looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
saw he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was down on his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) luck, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) remembered the tall, melancholy,
pale-faced woman whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had met weeping by the sea-shore the day that
Silver Braid had won the cup. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wondered what had happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), in
what corner did she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) live, and where was the son that John Randal had not
allowed to enter the Barfield establishment as page-boy, thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) would
be able to make something better of him (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>) than a servant.

<p/>The regular customers had begun to come in. Esther greeted them with nods
and smiles of recognition. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) drew the beer two glasses at once in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
hand, and picked up little zinc measures, two and four of whisky, and
filled them from a small tap. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) usually knew the taste of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) customers.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) made a mistake she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) muttered <div class="bookquote">``stupid,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and Mr. Ketley was much
amused at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) forgetting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) always drank out of the bottle; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) was
one of the few who came to the <div class="bookquote">``King's Head''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>who could afford sixpenny
whisky. <div class="bookquote">``I ought to have known by this time,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Well, mistakes
will occur in the best regulated families,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>the little butterman replied.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) was meagre and meek, with a sallow complexion and blond beard. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) pale
eyes were anxious, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) thin, bony hands restless. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) general manner
was oppressed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) frequently raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) hat to wipe his (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) forehead,
which was high and bald. At his (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) elbow stood Journeyman, Ketley's very
opposite. A tall, harsh, angular man, long features, a dingy complexion,
and the air of a dismissed soldier. He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) held a glass of whisky-and-water in
a hairy hand, and bit at the corner of a brown moustache. He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) wore a
threadbare black frock-coat, and carried a newspaper under his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) arm. Ketley
and Journeyman held widely different views regarding the best means of
backing horses. Ketley was preoccupied with dreams and omens; Journeyman,
a clerk in the parish registry office, studied public form; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) was guided
by it in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) speculations, and paid little heed to the various rumours
always afloat regarding private trials. Public form he (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) admitted did not
always come out right, but if a man had a headpiece and could remember all
the running, public form was good enough to follow. Racing with Journeyman
was a question of calculation, and great therefore was his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) contempt for
the weak and smiling Ketley, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) went for on all occasions. But Ketley
was pluckier than his (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) appearance indicated, and the duels between the two
were a constant source of amusement in the bar of the <div class="bookquote">``King's Head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ketley/Mr. Ketley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Herbert, the omen wasn't altogether up to the mark this time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>said
Journeyman, with a malicious twinkle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) small brown eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it was one of them unfortunate accidents.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One of them unfortunate accidents,''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>repeated Journeyman, derisively;
<div class="bookquote">``what's accidents to do with them that `as to do with the reading of
omens? I thought they rose above such trifles as weights, distances, bad
riding... A stone or two should make no difference if the omen is right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div><p/>Ketley was no way put out by the slight titter that Journeyman's retort
had produced in the group about the bar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) whisky-and-water
deliberately, like one, to use a racing expression, who had been over the
course before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've `eard that argument. I know all about it, but it don't alter me. Too
many strange things occur for me to think that everything can be
calculated with a bit of lead-pencil in a greasy pocket-book.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has the grease of my pocket-book to do with it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>replied Journeyman,
looking round. The company smiled and nodded. <div class="bookquote">``You says that signs and
omens is above any calculation of weights. Never mind the pocket-book,
greasy or not greasy; you says that these omens is more to be depended on
than the best stable information.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought that you placed no reliance on stable information, and that you
was guided by the weights that you calculated in that `ere pocket-book.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's my pocket-book to do with it? You want to see my pocket-book;
well, here it is, and I'll bet two glasses of beer that it ain't greasier
than any other pocket-book in this bar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see meself what pocket-books, greasy or not greasy, has to do
with it,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William. <div class="bookquote">``Walter put a fair question to Herbert. The omen
didn't come out right, and Walter wanted to know why it didn't come out
right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>said Journeyman.

<p/>All eyes were now fixed on Ketley. <div class="bookquote">``You want to know why the omen wasn't
right? I'll tell you--because it was no omen at all, that's why. The omens
always comes right; it is we who aren't always in the particular state of
mind that allows us to read the omens right.''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>Journeyman shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)
shoulders contemptuously. Ketley looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) with the same expression of
placid amusement. <div class="bookquote">``You'd like me to explain; well, I will. The omen is
always right, but we aren't always in the state of mind for the reading of
the omen. You think that ridiculous, Walter; but why should omens differ
from other things? Some days we can get through our accounts in `alf the
time we can at other times, the mind being clearer. I asks all present if
that is not so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ketley/Mr. Ketley</b></font>)</div><p/>Ketley had got hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) audience, and Journeyman's remark about closing
time only provoked a momentary titter. Ketley looked long and steadily at
Journeyman and then said, <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps closing time won't do no more for your
calculation of weights than for my omens... I know them jokes, we've
`eard them afore; but I'm not making jokes; I'm talking serious.''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>The
company nodded approval. <div class="bookquote">``I was saying there was times when the mind is
fresh like the morning. That's the time for them what `as got the gift of
reading the omens. It is a sudden light that comes into the mind, and it
points straight like a ray of sunlight, if there be nothing to stop it...
Now do you understand?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No one had understood, but all felt that they were
on the point of understanding. <div class="bookquote">``The whole thing is in there being nothing
to interrupt the light.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you says yourself that yer can't always read them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>said Journeyman;
<div class="bookquote">``an accident will send you off on the wrong tack, so it all comes to the
same thing, omens or no omens.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A man will trip over a piece of wire laid across the street, but that
don't prove he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can't walk, do it, Walter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Walter</b></font>)</div><p/>Walter was unable to say that it did not, and so Ketley scored another
point over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) opponent. <div class="bookquote">``I made a mistake, I know I did, and if it will
help you to understand I'll tell you how it was made. Three weeks ago I
was in this `ere bar `aving what I usually takes. It was a bit early; none
of you fellows had come in. I don't think it was much after eight. The
governor was away in the north racin'--hadn't been `ome for three or four
days; the missus was beginning to look a bit lonely.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ketley/Mr. Ketley</b></font>)</div>Ketley smiled and
glanced at Esther, who had told Charles to serve some customers, and was
listening as intently as the rest. ``I'd `ad a nice bit of supper, and was
just feeling that fresh and clear `eaded as I was explaining to you just
now is required for the reading, thinking of nothing in perticler, when
suddenly the light came. I remembered a conversation I `ad with a chap
about American corn. He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) wouldn't `ear of the Government taxing corn to
`elp the British farmer. Well, that conversation came back to me as clear
as if the dawn had begun to break. I could positively see the bloody corn;
I could pretty well `ave counted it. I felt there was an omen about
somewhere, and all of a tremble I took up the paper; it was lying on the
bar just where your hand is, Walter. But at that moment, just as I was
about to cast my eye down the list of `orses, a cab comes down the street
as `ard as it could tear. There was but two or three of us in the bar, and
we rushed out--the shafts was broke, `orse galloping and kicking, and the
cabby `olding on as `ard as he (<font color='blue'><b>cabby</b></font>) could. But it was no good, it was bound to
go, and over it went against the kerb. The cabby, poor chap, was pretty
well shook to pieces; his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) leg was broke, and we'd to `elp to take him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) to
the hosspital. Now I asks if it was no more than might be expected that I
should have gone wrong about the omen. Next day, as luck would have it, I
rolled up `alf a pound of butter in a piece of paper on which <div class="bookquote">``Cross
Roads' was written.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if there had been no accident and you `ad looked down the list of
`orses, `ow do yer know that yer would `ave spotted the winner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, not Wheatear, and with all that American corn in my `ead? Is it
likely I'd've missed it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ketley/Mr. Ketley</b></font>)</div><p/>No one answered, and Ketley drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) whisky in the midst of a most
thoughtful silence. At last one of the group said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) seemed to
express the general mind of the company--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know if omens be worth a-following of, but I'm blowed if `orses
be worth backing if the omens is again them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) neighbour answered, <div class="bookquote">``And they do come wonderful true occasional. They
`as `appened to me, and I daresay to all `ere present.''  (<font color='red'><b>neighbour</b></font>)</div>The company
nodded. <div class="bookquote">``You've noticed how them that knows nothing at all about
`orses--the less they knows the better their luck--will look down the lot
and spot the winner from pure fancy--the name that catches their eyes as
likely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's something in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>a butcher</b></font>)</div>said a corpulent butcher with huge, pursy,
prominent eyes and a portentous stomach. ``I always held with going to
church, and I hold still more with going to church since I backed Vanity
for the Chester Cup. I was a-falling asleep over the sermon, when suddenly
I wakes up hearing, <div class="bookquote">``Vanity of vanities, and all is vanity.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Several similar stories were told, and then various systems for backing
horses were discussed. <div class="bookquote">``You don't believe that no `orses is pulled?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Stack, the porter at Sutherland Mansions, Oxford Street, a large,
bluff man, wearing a dark blue square-cut frock coat with brass buttons. A
curious-looking man, with red-stained skin, dark beady eyes, a scanty
growth of beard, and a loud, assuming voice. <div class="bookquote">``You don't believe that no
`orses is pulled?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reiterated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't say that no `orse was never pulled,''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>said Journeyman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) stood
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) back leaning against the partition, his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) long legs stretched out.
<div class="bookquote">``If one was really in the know, then I don't say nothing about it; but who
of us is ever really in the know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not so sure about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stack/Stack</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Stack. <div class="bookquote">``There's a young man in my
mansions that `as a servant; this servant's cousin, a girl in the country,
keeps company with one of the lads in the White House stable. If that
ain't good enough, I don't know what is; good enough for my half-crown and
another pint of beer too, Mrs. Latch, as you'll be that kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther drew the beer, and Old John, who had said nothing till now,
suddenly joined in the conversation. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) too had heard of something; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
didn't know if it was the same as Stack had heard of; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) didn't expect it
was. It couldn't very well be, 'cause no one knew of this particular
horse, not a soul!--not `alf-a-dozen people in the world. No, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would
tell no one until his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) money and the stable money was all right. And he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
didn't care for no half-crowns or dollars this time, if he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) couldn't get a
sovereign or two on the horse he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'d let it alone. This time he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'d be a man
or a mouse. Every one was listening intently, but old John suddenly
assumed an air of mystery and refused to say another word. The
conversation worked back whither it had started, and again the best method
of backing horses was passionately discussed. Interrupting someone whose
theories seemed intolerably ludicrous, Journeyman said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's `ear what's the governor's opinion; he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) ought to know what kind of
backer gets the most out of him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div><p/>Journeyman's proposal to submit the question to the governor met with very
general approval. Even the vagrant who had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) tankard of porter to
the bench where he (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) could drink and eat what fragments of food he (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) had
collected, came forward, interested to know what kind of backer got most
out of the bookmaker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William, ``I haven't been making a book as long as some of
them, but since you ask me what I think I tell you straight. I don't care
a damn whether they backs according to their judgment, or their dreams, or
their fancy. The cove that follows favourites, or the cove that backs a
jockey's mount, the cove that makes an occasional bet when he (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) hears of a
good thing, the cove that bets regular, `cording to a system--the cove,
yer know, what doubles every time--or the cove that bets as the mood takes
him (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>)--them and all the other coves, too numerous to be mentioned, I'm glad
to do business with. I cries out to one as `eartily as to another: ``The
old firm, the old firm, don't forget the old firm... What can I do for
you to-day, sir?<div class="bookquote">'' There's but one sort of cove I can't abide.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) is--''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>said Journeyman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) is Mr. George Buff.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's he (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>)? who's he (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked several; and the vagrant caused some amusement
by the question, <div class="bookquote">``Do 'e bet on the course?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) do,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William, <div class="bookquote">``an' nowhere else. He (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>)'s at every meeting as
reg`lar as if he (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) was a bookie himself. I `ates to see his (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) face... I'd be
a rich man if I'd all the money that man `as `ad out of me in the last
three years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What should you say was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) system?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stack/Stack</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Stack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know no more than yerselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This admission seemed a little chilling; for everyone had thought himself
many steps nearer El Dorado.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But did you ever notice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ketley/Mr. Ketley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Ketley, <div class="bookquote">``that there was certain days
on which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ketley/Mr. Ketley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I never noticed that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they outsiders that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) backs?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Stack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, only favourites. But what I can't make out is that there are times
when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't touch them; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) don't, nine times out of ten they're
beaten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are the `orses he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) backs what you'd call well in?''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>said Journeyman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not always.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it must be on information from the stable authorities?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Stack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dun know,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William; <div class="bookquote">``have it that way if you like, but I'm glad
there ain't many about like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d take his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) custom elsewhere. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
gives me the solid hump, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What sort of man should you say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was? `as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) been a servant, should you
say?''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Waters</b></font>)</div>asked old John.

<p/>``I can't tell you what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is. Always new suit of clothes and a hie-glass.
Whenever I see that `ere hie-glass and that brown beard my heart goes down
in my boots. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) don't bet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) takes no notice, walks past with a vague
look on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't see the people, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) don't care that
for the `orses. Knowing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) don't mean no business, I cries to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), ``The
best price, Mr. Buff; two to one on the field, ten to one bar two or
three.<div class="bookquote">'' He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) just catches his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hie-glass tighter in eye and looks at me,
smiles, shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) head, and goes on. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) is a warm `un; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) is just about
as `ot as they make 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>price Mr. Buff</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What I can't make out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>said Journeyman, <div class="bookquote">``is why he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) bets on the course.
You say he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) don't know nothing about horses. Why don't he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) remain at `ome
and save the exes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've thought of all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William, <div class="bookquote">``and can't make no more out of
it than you can yerselves. All we know is that, divided up between five or
six of us, Buff costs not far short of six `undred a year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment a small blond man came into the bar. Esther knew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at
once. It was Ginger. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had hardly changed at all--a little sallower, a
little dryer, a trifle less like a gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't you step round, sir, to the private bar?''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William. <div class="bookquote">``You'll be
more comfortable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hardly worth while. I was at the theatre, and I thought I'd come in and
have a look round... I see that you haven't forgotten the old horses,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
said, catching sight of the prints of Silver Braid and Summer's Dean which
William had hung on the wall. <div class="bookquote">``That was a great day, wasn't it? Fifty to
one chance, started at thirty; and you remember the Gaffer tried him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) to
win with twenty pound more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaffer</b></font>) had to carry... Hullo, John! very glad
to see you again; growing strong and well, I hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The servant</b></font>)</div><p/>The old servant looked so shabby that Esther was not surprised that Ginger
did not shake hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginger</b></font>) wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) would remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginger</b></font>), and
as the thought passed through her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginger</b></font>) mind he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) extended his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) hand across the
bar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I `ope I may have the honour of drinking a glass of wine with you, sir,''
 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William. Ginger raised no objection, and William told Esther to go
down-stairs and fetch up a bottle of champagne.

<p/>Ketley, Journeyman, Stack, and the others listened eagerly. To meet the
celebrated gentleman-rider was a great event in their lives. But the
conversation was confined to the Barfield horses; it was carried on by the
merest allusion, and Journeyman wearied of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) must be getting
home; the others nodded, finished their glasses, and bade William
good-night as they left. A couple of flower-girls with loose hair, shawls,
and trays of flowers, suggestive of streetfaring, came in and ordered four
ale. They spoke to the vagrant, who collected his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) match-boxes in
preparation for a last search for charity. William cut the wires of the
champagne, and at that moment Charles, who had gone through with the
ladder to turn out the street lamp, returned with a light overcoat on his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
arm which he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said a cove outside wanted to sell him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) for two-and-six.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I knowed him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). I had to put him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) out the other night--Bill Evans, the
cove that wears the blue Melton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>The swing doors were opened, and a man between thirty and forty came in.
He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was about the medium height; a dark olive skin, black curly hair,
picturesque and disreputable, like a bird of prey in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) blue Melton
jacket and billycock hat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better `ave the coat,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``you won't better it;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and coming
into the bar he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) planked down a penny as if it were a sovereign. <div class="bookquote">``Glass of
porter; nice warm weather, good for the `arvest. Just come up from the
country--a bit dusty, ain't I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ain't you the chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William, <div class="bookquote">``what laid Mr. Ketley six `alf-crowns
to one against Cross Roads?''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles nodded, and William continued--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like your cheek coming into my bar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No harm done, gov`nor; no one was about; wouldn't `ave done it if they
had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That'll do,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William. <div class="bookquote">''... No, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) don't want the coat. We likes to
know where our things comes from.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>Bill Evans finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) glass. <div class="bookquote">``Good-night, guv`nor; no ill-feeling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The flower-girls laughed; one offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) a flower. <div class="bookquote">``Take it for love,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) was kind enough to do so, and the three went out together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like the looks of that chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) let go the
champagne cork. <div class="bookquote">``Yer health, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They raised their glasses, and the
conversation turned on next week's racing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dun know about next week's events,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Waters</b></font>)</div>said old John, <div class="bookquote">``but I've heard of
something for the Leger--an outsider will win.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you backed it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would if I had the money, but things have been going very unlucky with
me lately. But I'd advise you, sir, to have a trifle on. It's the best tip
I `ave had in my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginger</b></font>)</div>said Ginger, beginning to feel interested, <div class="bookquote">``so I will, and so
shall you. I'm damned if you shan't have your bit on. Come, what is it?
William will lay the odds. What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ginger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Briar Rose, the White House stable, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I thought that--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ginger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No such thing, sir; Briar Rose's the one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ginger</b></font>)</div><p/>Ginger took up the paper. <div class="bookquote">``Twenty-five to one Briar Rose taken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, sir, it was taken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you lay the price, William--twenty-five half-sovereigns to one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I'll lay it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ginger</b></font>)</div><p/>Ginger took a half-sovereign from his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) pocket and handed it to the
bookmaker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never take money over this bar. You're good for a thin `un, sir,''
 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>William said, with a smile, as he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) handed back the money.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't know when I shall see you again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginger</b></font>)</div>said Ginger. <div class="bookquote">``It will be
very inconvenient. There's no one in the bar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None but the match-seller and them two flower-girls. I suppose they don't
matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Happiness flickered up through the old greyness of the face. Henceforth
something to live for. Each morning bringing news of the horse, and the
hours of the afternoon passing pleasantly, full of thoughts of the evening
paper and the gossip of the bar. A bet on a race brings hope into lives
which otherwise would be hopeless.




<p/>XXXI


<p/>Never had a Derby excited greater interest. Four hot favourites, between
which the public seemed unable to choose. Two to one taken and offered
against Fly-leaf, winner of the Two Thousand; four to one taken and
offered against Signet-ring, who, half-trained, had run Fly-leaf to a
head. Four to one against Necklace, the winner of the Middle Park Plate
and the One Thousand. Seven to one against Dewberry, the brilliant winner
of the Newmarket stakes. The chances of these horses were argued every
night at the <div class="bookquote">``King's Head.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ketley/Mr. Ketley</b></font>)</div>Ketley's wife used to wear a string of yellow
beads when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was a girl, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wasn't certain what had become of them.
Ketley did not wear a signet-ring, and had never known anyone who did.
Dewberries grew on the river banks, but they were not ripe yet. Fly-leaf,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) could not make much of that--not being much of a reader. So what with
one thing and another Ketley didn't believe much in this `ere Derby.
Journeyman caustically remarked that, omens or no omens, one horse was
bound to win. Why didn't Herbert look for an omen among the outsiders? Old
John's experiences led him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to think that the race lay between Fly-leaf and
Signet-ring. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had a great faith in blood, and Signet-ring came of a more
staying stock than did Fly-leaf. <div class="bookquote">``When they begin to climb out of the dip
Fly-leaf will have had about enough of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Stack nodded approval. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had
five bob on Dewberry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dewberry</b></font>) didn't know much about his (<font color='blue'><b>Dewberry</b></font>) staying powers, but
all the stable is on him (<font color='blue'><b>Dewberry</b></font>); ``and when I know the stable-money is right I
says, <div class="bookquote">``That's good enough for me!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Ginger, who came in occasionally, was very sweet on Necklace, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Dewberry</b></font>)
declared to be the finest mare of the century. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dewberry</b></font>) was listened to with
awed attention, and there was a death-like silence in the bar when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dewberry</b></font>)
described how she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) had won the One Thousand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dewberry</b></font>) wouldn't have ridden her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)
quite that way himself; but then what was a steeplechase rider's opinion
worth regarding a flat race? The company demurred, and old John alluded to
Ginger's magnificent riding when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) won the Liverpool on Foxcover,
steadying the horse about sixty yards from home, and bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) up with
a rush in the last dozen strides, nailing Jim Sutton, who had persevered
all the way, on the very post by a head. Bill Evans, who happened to look
in that evening, said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) would not be surprised to see all the four
favourites bowled out by an outsider. He (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) had heard something that was good
enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) didn't suppose the guv`nor would take him (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) on the nod,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) had a nice watch which ought to be good for three ten.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Turn it up, old mate,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, guv`nor, I never presses my goods on them that don't want 'em.
If there's any other gentleman who would like to look at this `ere
timepiece, or a pair of sleeve links, they're in for fifteen shillings.
Here's the ticket. I'm a bit short of money, and have a fancy for a
certain outsider. I'd like to have my bit on, and I'll dispose of the
ticket for--what do you say to a thin `un, Mr. Ketley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you `ear me speak just now?''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>William answered angrily, <div class="bookquote">``or shall I
have to get over the counter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose, Mrs. Latch, you have seen a great deal of racing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginger</b></font>)</div>said
Ginger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir. I've heard a great deal about racing, but I never saw a race
run.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How's that, shouldn't you care?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, my husband has his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) betting to attend to, and there's the house
to look after.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never thought of it before,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William. <div class="bookquote">``You've never seen a race
run, no more you haven't. Would you care to come and see the Derby run
next week, Esther?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I should.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the policeman</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment the policeman stopped and looked in. All eyes went up to
the clock, and Esther said, <div class="bookquote">``We shall lose our licence if--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If we don't get out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Ginger.

<p/>William apologised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The law is the law, sir, for rich and poor alike; should be sorry to
hurry you, sir, but in these days very little will lose a man his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house.
Now, Herbert, finish your drink. No, Walter, can't serve any more liquor
to-night... Charles, close the private bar, let no one else in... Now,
gentlemen, gentlemen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Old John lit his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) pipe and led the way. William held the door for them. A
few minutes after the house was closed.

<p/>A locking of drawers, fastening of doors, putting away glasses, making
things generally tidy, an hour's work before bed-time, and then they
lighted their candle in the little parlour and went upstairs.

<p/>William flung off his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) coat. <div class="bookquote">``I'm dead beat,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and all this to
lose--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) didn't finish the sentence. Esther said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've a heavy book on the Derby. Perhaps an outsider'll win.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I `ope so... But if you'd care to see the race, I think it can be
managed. I shall be busy, but Journeyman or Ketley will look after you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that I should care to walk about all day with Journeyman,
nor Ketley neither.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were both tired, and with an occasional remark they undressed and got
into bed. Esther laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) head on the pillow and closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder if there's any one going who you'd care for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care a bit about it, Bill.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The conversation paused. At the end
of a long silence William said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It do seem strange that you who has been mixed up in it so much should
never have seen a race.''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>Esther didn't answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was falling asleep, and
William's voice was beginning to sound vague in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) ears. Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
felt him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) give her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) a great shove. <div class="bookquote">``Wake up, old girl, I've got it. Why not
ask your old pal, Sarah Tucker, to go with us? I heard John say she (<font color='blue'><b>Tucker</b></font>)'s out
of situation. It'll be a nice treat for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tucker</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah... I should like to see Sarah again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're half asleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm not; you said we might ask Sarah to come to the Derby with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>William regretted that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had not a nice trap to drive them down. To hire
one would run into a deal of money, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was afraid it might make him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
late on the course. Besides, the road wasn't what it used to be; every one
goes by train now. They dropped off to sleep talking of how they should
get Sarah's address.

<p/>Three or four days passed, and one morning William jumped out of bed and
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it will be a fine day, Esther.''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) best suit of
clothes, and selected a handsome silk scarf for the occasion. Esther was a
heavy sleeper, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) lay close to the wall, curled up. Taking no notice
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), William went on dressing; then he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now then, Esther, get up. Teddy will be here presently to pack up my
clothes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it time to get up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I should think it was. For God's sake, get up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had a new dress for the Derby. It had been bought in Tottenham Court
Road, and had only come home last night. A real summer dress! A lilac
pattern on a white ground, the sleeves and throat and the white hat
tastefully trimmed with lilac and white lace; a nice sunshade to match. At
that moment a knock came at the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, Teddy, wait a moment, my wife's not dressed yet. Do make
haste, Esther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther stepped into the skirt so as not to ruffle her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hair, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was
buttoning the bodice when little Mr. Blamy entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorry to disturb you, ma'am, but there isn't no time to lose if the
governor don't want to lose his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) place on the `ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now then, Teddy, make haste, get the toggery out; don't stand there
talking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The little man spread the Gladstone bag upon the floor and took a suit of
checks from the chest of drawers, each square of black and white nearly as
large as a sixpence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll wear the green tie, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>William nodded. The green tie was a yard
of flowing sea-green silk. <div class="bookquote">``I've got you a bunch of yellow flowers, sir;
will you wear them now, or shall I put them in the bag?''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>William glanced at the bouquet. <div class="bookquote">``They look a bit loud,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I'll
wait till we get on the course; put them in the bag.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The card to be worn in the white hat--<div class="bookquote">``William Latch, London,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in gold
letters on a green ground--was laid on top. The boots with soles three
inches high went into the box on which William stood while he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) halloaed his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
prices to the crowd. Then there were the two poles which supported a strip
of white linen, on which was written in gold letters, ``William Latch, ``The
King's Head,<div class="bookquote">'' London. Fair prices, prompt payment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The King</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a grey day, with shafts of sunlight coming through, and as the cab
passed over Waterloo Bridge, London, various embankments and St. Paul's on
one side, wharves and warehouses on the other, appeared in grey curves and
straight silhouettes. The pavements were lined with young men--here and
there a girl's dress was a spot of colour in the grey morning. At the
station they met Journeyman and old John, but Sarah was nowhere to be
found. William said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall be late; we shall have to go without her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther's face clouded. <div class="bookquote">``We can't go without her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>); don't be so impatient.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>At that moment a white muslin was seen in the distance, and Esther said,
<div class="bookquote">``I think that that's Sarah.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can chatter in the train--you'll have a whole hour to talk about each
other's dress; get in, get in,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>and William pressed them into a
third-class carriage. They had not seen each other for so long a while,
and there was so much to say that they did not know where to begin. Sarah
was the first to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was kind of you to think of me. So you've married, and to him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) after
all!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) added, lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) voice.

<p/>Esther laughed. <div class="bookquote">``It do seem strange, don't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll tell me all about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder we didn't run across
one another before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They rolled out of the grey station into the light, and the plate-glass
drew the rays together till they burnt the face and hands. They sped
alongside of the upper windows nearly on a level with the red and yellow
chimney-pots; they passed open spaces filled with cranes, old iron, and
stacks of railway sleepers, pictorial advertisements, sky signs, great
gasometers rising round and black in their iron cages over-topping or
nearly the slender spires. A train steamed along a hundred-arched viaduct;
and along a black embankment the other trains rushed by in a whirl of
wheels, bringing thousands of clerks up from the suburbs to their city
toil.

<p/>The excursion jogged on, stopping for long intervals before strips of
sordid garden where shirts and pink petticoats were blowing. Little
streets ascended the hillsides; no more trams, `buses, too, had
disappeared, and afoot the folk hurried along the lonely pavements of
their suburbs. At Clapham Junction betting men had crowded the platform;
they all wore grey overcoats with race-glasses slung over their shoulders.
And the train still rolled through the brick wilderness which old John
said was all country forty years ago.

<p/>The men puffed at their pipes, and old John's anecdotes about the days
when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) and the Gaffer, in company with all the great racing men of the
day, used to drive down by road, were listened to with admiration. Esther
had finished telling the circumstances in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had met Margaret; and
Sarah questioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) about William and how her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) marriage had come about.
The train had stopped outside of a little station, and the blue sky, with
its light wispy clouds, became a topic of conversation. Old John did not
like the look of those clouds, and the women glanced at the waterproofs
which they carried on their arms.

<p/>They passed bits of common with cows and a stray horse, also a little
rural cemetery; but London suddenly began again parish after parish, the
same blue roofs, the same tenement houses. The train had passed the first
cedar and the first tennis lawn. And knowing it to be a Derby excursion
the players paused in their play and looked up. Again the line was
blocked; the train stopped again and again. But it had left London behind,
and the last stoppage was in front of a beautiful June landscape. A thick
meadow with a square weather-beaten church showing between the spreading
trees; miles of green corn, with birds flying in the bright air, and lazy
clouds going out, making way for the endless blue of a long summer's day.




<p/>XXXII


<p/>It had been arranged that William should don his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) betting toggery at the
<div class="bookquote">``Spread Eagle Inn.''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>It stood at the cross-roads, only a little way from
the station--a square house with a pillared porch. Even at this early hour
the London pilgrimage was filing by. Horses were drinking in the trough;
their drivers were drinking in the bar; girls in light dresses shared
glasses of beer with young men. But the greater number of vehicles passed
without stopping, anxious to get on the course. They went round the turn
in long procession, a policeman on a strong horse occupied the middle of
the road. The waggonettes and coaches had red-coated guards, and the air
was rent with the tooting of the long brass horns. Every kind of dingy
trap went by, sometimes drawn by two, sometimes by only one horse--shays
half a century old jingled along; there were even donkey-carts. Esther and
Sarah were astonished at the number of costers, but old John told them
that that was nothing to what it was fifty years ago. The year that
Andover won the block began seven or eight miles from Epsom. They were
often half-an-hour without moving. Such chaffing and laughing, the coster
cracked his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) joke with the duke, but all that was done away with now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gracious!''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther, when William appeared in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) betting toggery. <div class="bookquote">``I
shouldn't have known you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) did seem very wonderful in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) checks, green necktie, yellow flowers,
and white hat with its gold inscription, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. William Latch, London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``you never saw me before in these togs--fine,
ain't they? But we're very late. Mr. North has offered to run me up to the
course, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)'s only two places. Teddy and me must be getting along--but
you needn't hurry. The races won't begin for hours yet. It's only about a
mile--a nice walk. These gentlemen will look after you. You know where to
find me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, turning to John and Walter. <div class="bookquote">``You'll look after my wife
and Miss Tucker, won't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and forthwith he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) and Teddy jumped into a
waggonette and drove away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's what I calls cheek,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>said Sarah. <div class="bookquote">``Going off by himself in a
waggonette and leaving us to foot it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) must look after his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) place on the `ill or else he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>)'ll do no betting,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>said Journeyman. <div class="bookquote">``We've plenty of time; racing don't begin till after
one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Recollections of what the road had once been had loosened John's tongue,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) continued his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) reminiscences of the great days when Sir Thomas
Hayward had laid fifteen thousand to ten thousand three times over against
the favourite. The third bet had been laid at this very spot, but the Duke
would not accept the third bet, saying that the horse was then being
backed on the course at evens. So Sir Thomas had only lost thirty thousand
pounds on the race. Journeyman was deeply interested in the anecdote; but
Sarah looked at the old man with a look that said, <div class="bookquote">``Well, if I'm to pass
the day with you two I never want to go to the Derby again... Come on in
front,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) whispered to Esther, <div class="bookquote">``and let them talk about their racing by
themselves.''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>The way led through a field ablaze with buttercups; it passed
by a fish-pond into which three drunkards were gazing. <div class="bookquote">``Do you hear what
they're saying about the fish?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>said Sarah.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't pay no attention to them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther. <div class="bookquote">``If you knew as much about
drunkards as I do, you'd want no telling to give them a wide berth...
Isn't the country lovely? Isn't the air soft and warm?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't want no more country. I'm that glad to get back to town. I
wouldn't take another situation out of London if I was offered twenty a
year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But look,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther, <div class="bookquote">``at the trees. I've hardly been in the country
since I left Woodview, unless you call Dulwich the country--that's where
Jackie was at nurse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>The Cockney pilgrimage passed into a pleasant lane overhung with chestnut
and laburnum trees. The spring had been late, and the white blossoms stood
up like candles--the yellow dropped like tassels, and the streaming
sunlight filled the leaves with tints of pale gold, and their light
shadows patterned the red earth of the pathway. But very soon this
pleasant pathway debouched on a thirsting roadway where tired horses
harnessed to heavy vehicles toiled up a long hill leading to the Downs.
The trees intercepted the view, and the blown dust whitened the foliage
and the wayside grass, now in possession of hawker and vagrant. The crowd
made way for the traps; and the young men in blue and grey trousers, and
their girls in white dresses, turned and watched the four horses bringing
along the tall drag crowned with London fashion. There the unwieldly
omnibus and the brake filled with fat girls in pink dresses and yellow
hats, and there the spring cart drawn up under a hedge. The cottage gates
were crowded with folk come to see London going to the Derby. Outhouses
had been converted into refreshment bars, and from these came a smell of
beer and oranges; further on there was a lamentable harmonium--a blind man
singing hymns to its accompaniment, and a one-legged man holding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat
for alms; and not far away there stood an earnest-eyed woman offering
tracts, warning folk of their danger, beseeching them to retrace their
steps.

<p/>At last the trees ceased and they found themselves on the hilltop in a
glare of sunlight, on a space of worn ground where donkeys were tethered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this the Derby?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>said Sarah.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you're not disappointed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear; but where's all the people--the drags, the carriages?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll see them presently,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Waters</b></font>)</div>said old John, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) volunteered some
explanations. The white building was the Grand Stand. The winning-post was
a little further this way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where do they start?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>said Sarah.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Over yonder, where you see that clump. They run through the furze right
up to Tattenham Corner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div><p/>A vast crowd swarmed over the opposite hill, and beyond the crowd the
women saw a piece of open downland dotted with bushes, and rising in
gentle incline to a belt of trees which closed the horizon. <div class="bookquote">``Where them
trees are, that's _Tattenham Corner_.''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Waters</b></font>)</div>The words seemed to fill old John
with enthusiasm, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) described how the horses came round this side of
the trees. <div class="bookquote">``They comes right down that `ere `ill--there's the dip--and
they finishes opposite to where we is standing. Yonder, by Barnard's
Ring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, all among the people?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>said Sarah.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The police will get the people right back up the hill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's where we shall find William,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm getting a bit peckish; ain't you, dear? He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)'s got the
luncheon-basket... but, lor', what a lot of people! Look at that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/>What had attracted Sarah's attention was a boy walking through the crowd
on a pair of stilts fully eight feet high. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) uttered short warning cries
from time to time, held out his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wide trousers and caught pennies in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
conical cap. Drags and carriages continued to arrive. The sweating horses
were unyoked, and grooms and helpers rolled the vehicles into position
along the rails. Lackeys drew forth cases of wine and provisions, and the
flutter of table-cloths had begun to attract vagrants, itinerant
musicians, fortune-tellers, begging children. All these plied their trades
round the fashion of grey frock-coats and silk sun-shades. Along the rails
rough fellows lay asleep; the place looked like a vast dormitory; they lay
with their hats over their faces, clay pipes sticking from under the
brims, their brown-red hands upon the grey grass.

<p/>Suddenly old John pleaded an appointment; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was to meet a friend who
would give him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) the very latest news respecting a certain horse; and
Esther, Sarah, and Journeyman wandered along the course in search of
William. Along the rails strangely-dressed men stood on stools, satchels
and race-glasses slung over their shoulders, great bouquets in their
button-holes. Each stood between two poles on which was stretched a piece
of white-coloured linen, on which was inscribed their name in large gold
letters. Sarah read some of these names out: <div class="bookquote">``Jack Hooper, Marylebone. All
bets paid.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tom Wood's famous boxing rooms, Epsom.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``James Webster,
Commission Agent, London.''  (<font color='red'><b>these men</b></font>)</div>And these betting men bawled the prices from
the top of their high stools and shook their satchels, which were filled
with money, to attract custom. <div class="bookquote">``What can I do for you to-day, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>any man</b></font>)</div>they
shouted when they caught the eye of any respectably-dressed man. <div class="bookquote">``On the
Der-by, on the Der-by, I'll bet the Der-by... To win or a place, to win
or a place, to win or a place--seven to one bar two or three, seven to one
bar two or three... the old firm, the old firm,'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--like so many
challenging cocks, each trying to outshrill the other.

<p/>Under the hill-side in a quiet hollow had been pitched a large and
commodious tent. Journeyman mentioned that it was the West London
Gospel-tent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) thought the parson would have it pretty well all to
himself, and they stopped before a van filled with barrels of Watford
ales. A barrel had been taken from the van and placed on a small table;
glasses of beer were being served to a thirsty crowd; and all around were
little canvas shelters, whence men shouted, <div class="bookquote">''`Commodation, `commodation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>whence men</b></font>)</div><p/>The sun had risen high, and what clouds remained floated away like
filaments of white cotton. The Grand Stand, dotted like a ceiling with
flies, stood out distinct and harsh upon a burning plain of blue. The
light beat fiercely upon the booths, the carriages, the vehicles, the
<div class="bookquote">``rings,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the various stands. The country around was lost in the haze and
dazzle of the sunlight; but a square mile of downland fluttered with flags
and canvas, and the great mob swelled, and smoked, and drank, shied sticks
at Aunt Sally, and rode wooden horses. And through this crush of
perspiring, shrieking humanity Journeyman, Esther, and Sarah sought vainly
for William. The form of the ground was lost in the multitude and they
could only tell by the strain in their limbs whether they were walking up
or down hill. Sarah declared herself to be done up, and it was with
difficulty that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was persuaded to persevere a little longer. At last
Journeyman caught sight of the bookmaker's square shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, so here you are. What can I do for you, ladies? Ten to one bar
three or four. Will that suit you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The luncheon-basket will suit us a deal better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>said Sarah.

<p/>At that moment a chap came up jingling two half-crowns in his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``What
price the favourite?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Two to one,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>cried William. The two half-crowns
were dropped into the satchel, and, thus encouraged, William called out
louder than ever, <div class="bookquote">``The old firm, the old firm; don't forget the old firm.''
 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>There was a smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) lips while he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) halloaed--a cheery, good-natured
smile, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) popular and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) many a customer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the Der-by, on the Der-by, on the Der-by!''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>All kinds and conditions of
men came to make bets with him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>); custom was brisk; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) could not join the
women, who were busy with the lunch-basket, but he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) and Teddy would be
thankful for the biggest drink they could get them. <div class="bookquote">``Ginger beer with a
drop of whiskey in it, that's about it, Teddy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, guv`nor, that'll do for me... We're getting pretty full on
Dewberry; might come down a point, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, Teddy... And if you'd cut us a couple each of strong
sandwiches--you can manage a couple, Teddy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I can, guv`nor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a nice piece of beef in the basket, and Esther cut several large
sandwiches, buttering the bread thickly and adding plenty of mustard. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) brought them over William bent down and whispered--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My own duck of a wife, there's no one like her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther blushed and laughed with pleasure, and every trace of the
resentment for the suffering he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had occasioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) dropped out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
heart. For the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was really her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) husband; for the first time
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) felt that sense of unity in life which is marriage, and knew
henceforth he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was the one thing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had to live for.

<p/>After luncheon Journeyman, who was making no way with Sarah, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)
leave, pleading that he (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) had some friends to meet in Barnard's Ring. They
were glad to be rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>). Sarah had many a tale to tell; and while
listening to the matrimonial engagements that had been broken off, Esther
shifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) parasol from time to time to watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) tall, gaunt husband. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
shouted the odds, willing to bet against every horse, distributed tickets
to the various folk that crowded round him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), each with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) preference, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
prejudice, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) belief in omens, in tips, or in the talent and luck of a
favourite jockey. Sarah continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) cursive chatter regarding the places
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had served in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) felt inclined for a snooze, but was afraid it would
not look well. While hesitating she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) ceased speaking, and both women fell
asleep under the shade of their parasols. It was the shallow, glassy sleep
of the open air, through which they divined easily the great blur that was
the race-course.

<p/>They could hear William's voice, and they heard a bell ring and shouts of
<div class="bookquote">``Here they come!''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>Then a lull came, and their perceptions grew a little
denser, and when they awoke the sky was the same burning blue, and the
multitude moved to and fro like puppets.

<p/>Sarah was in no better temper after than before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) sleep. <div class="bookquote">``It's all very
well for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You have your husband to look after... I'll
never come to the Derby again without a young man... I'm tired of sitting
here, the grass is roasting. Come for a walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div><p/>They were two nice-looking English women of the lower classes, prettily
dressed in light gowns with cheap sunshades in their cotton-gloved hands.
Sarah looked at every young man with regretful eyes. In such moods
acquaintanceships are made; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) did not allow Esther to shake off Bill
Evans, who, just as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) had never been turned out of the bar of the
<div class="bookquote">``King's Head,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>came up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) familiar, <div class="bookquote">``Good morning, ma'am--lovely
weather for the races.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Sarah's sidelong glances at the blue Melton jacket
and the billycock hat defined her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) feelings with sufficient explicitness,
and it was not probable that any warning would have been heeded. Soon they
were engaged in animated conversation, and Esther was left to follow them
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) liked.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) walked by Sarah's side, quite ignored, until she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was accosted by Fred
Parsons. They were passing by the mission tent, and Fred was calling upon
the folk to leave the ways of Satan for those of Christ. Bill Evans was
about to answer some brutal insult; but seeing that <div class="bookquote">``the Christian''  (<font color='red'><b>Bill/Bill Evans/Evans</b></font>)</div>knew
Esther he (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) checked himself in time. Esther stopped to speak to Fred, and
Bill seized the opportunity to slip away with Sarah.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't expect to meet you here, Esther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm here with my husband. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said a little pleasure--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is not innocent pleasure, Esther; this is drunkenness and
debauchery. I hope you'll never come again, unless you come with us,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)
said, pointing to some girls dressed as bookmakers, with Salvation and
Perdition written on the satchels hung round their shoulders. They sought
to persuade the passers-by to come into the tent. <div class="bookquote">``We shall be very glad
to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they said, and they distributed mock racing cards on which
was inscribed news regarding certain imaginary racing. <div class="bookquote">``The Paradise
Plate, for all comers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Parsons/Parsons</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Salvation Stakes, an Eternity of Happiness
added.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Parsons/Parsons</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) request. <div class="bookquote">``I hope the next time you come here it will be
with us; you'll strive to collect some of Christ's lost sheep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And my husband making a book yonder?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>An awkward silence intervened, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't you come in; service is going on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>). In the tent there were some benches, and on a
platform a grey-bearded man with an anxious face spoke of sinners and
redemption. Suddenly a harmonium began to play a hymn, and, standing side
by side, Esther and Fred sang together. Prayer was so inherent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) felt no sense of incongruity, and had she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) been questioned she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would
have answered that it did not matter where we are, or what we are doing,
we can always have God in our hearts.

<p/>Fred followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not forgotten your religion, I hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I never could forget that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why do I find you in such company? You don't come here like us to
find sinners.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't forgotten God, but I must do my duty to my husband. It would be
like setting myself up against my husband's business, and you don't think
I ought to do that? A wife that brings discord into the family is not a
good wife, so I've often heard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You always thought more of your husband than of Christ, Esther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Each one must follow Christ as best he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) can! It would be wrong of me to
set myself against my husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) married you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Parsons/Parsons</b></font>)</div>Fred answered bitterly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. You thought he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'d desert me a second time; but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s been the best of
husbands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I place little reliance on those who are not with Christ. His (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) love for
you is not of the Spirit. Let us not speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>). I loved you very
deeply, Esther. I would have brought you to Christ... But perhaps you'll
come to see us sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not forget Christ. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)'s always with me, and I believe you did care
for me. I was sorry to break it off, you know I was. It was not my fault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Esther, it was I who loved you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mustn't talk like that. I'm a married woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean no harm, Esther. I was only thinking of the past.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must forget all that... Good-bye; I'm glad to have seen you, and that
we said a prayer together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Parsons/Parsons</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred didn't answer, and Esther moved away, wondering where she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) should find
Sarah.




<p/>XXXIII


<p/>The crowd shouted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looked where the others looked, but saw only the
burning blue with the white stand marked upon it. It was crowded like the
deck of a sinking vessel, and Esther wondered at the excitement, the cause
of which was hidden from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wandered to the edge of the crowd until
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) came to a chalk road where horses and mules were tethered. A little
higher up she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) entered the crowd again, and came suddenly upon a switchback
railway. Full of laughing and screaming girls, it bumped over a middle
hill, and then rose slowly till it reached the last summit. It was shot
back again into the midst of its fictitious perils, and this mock voyaging
was accomplished to the sound of music from a puppet orchestra. Bells and
drums, a fife and a triangle, cymbals clashed mechanically, and a little
soldier beat the time. Further on, under a striped awning, were the wooden
horses. They were arranged so well that they rocked to and fro, imitating
as nearly as possible the action of real horses. Esther watched the
riders. A blue skirt looked like a riding habit, and a girl in salmon pink
leaned back in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) saddle just as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been taught how to ride. A
girl in a grey jacket encouraged a girl in white who rode a grey horse.
But before Esther could make out for certain that the man in the blue
Melton jacket was Bill Evans he (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) had passed out of sight, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had to
wait until his (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) horse came round the second time. At that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) caught
sight of the red poppies in Sarah's hat.

<p/>The horses began to slacken speed. They went slower and slower, then
stopped altogether. The riders began to dismount and Esther pressed
through the bystanders, fearing she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would not be able to overtake her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
friends.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, here you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>said Sarah. <div class="bookquote">``I thought I never should find you again.
How hot it is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you on in that ride? Let's have another, all three of us. These
three horses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Round and round they went, their steeds bobbing nobly up and down to the
sound of fifes, drums and cymbals. They passed the winning-post many
times; they had to pass it five times, and the horse that stopped nearest
it won the prize. A long-drawn-out murmur, continuous as the sea, swelled
up from the course--a murmur which at last passed into words: <div class="bookquote">``Here they
come; blue wins, the favourite's beat.''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther paid little attention to
these cries; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not understand them; they reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) indistinctly
and soon died away, absorbed in the strident music that accompanied the
circling horses. These had now begun to slacken speed... They went slower
and slower. Sarah and Bill, who rode side by side, seemed like winning,
but at the last moment they glided by the winning-post. Esther's steed
stopped in time, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was told to choose a china mug from a great heap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've all the luck to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bill/Bill Evans/Evans</b></font>)</div>said Bill. <div class="bookquote">``Hayfield, who was backed all the
winter, broke down a month ago... 2 to 1 against Fly-leaf, 4 to 1 against
Signet-ring, 4 to 1 against Dewberry, 10 to 1 against Vanguard, the winner
at 50 to 1 offered. Your husband must have won a little fortune. Never was
there such a day for the bookies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther said she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was very glad, and was undecided which mug she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) should
choose. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) saw one on which <div class="bookquote">``Jack''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was written in gold letters.
They then visited the peep-shows, and especially liked St. James's Park
with the Horse Guards out on parade; the Spanish bull-fight did not stir
them, and Sarah couldn't find a single young man to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) taste in the House
of Commons. Among the performing birds they liked best a canary that
climbed a ladder. Bill was attracted by the American strength-testers, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) gave an exhibition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) muscle, to Sarah's very great admiration.
They all had some shies at cocoa-nuts, and passed by J. Bilton's great
bowling saloon without visiting it. Once more the air was rent with the
cries of <div class="bookquote">``Here they come! Here they come!''  (<font color='red'><b>the commodation men</b></font>)</div>Even the `commodation men left
their canvas shelters and pressed forward inquiring which had won. A
moment after a score of pigeons floated and flew through the blue air and
then departed in different directions, some making straight for London,
others for the blue mysterious evening that had risen about the Downs--the
sun-baked Downs strewn with waste paper and covered by tipsy men and
women, a screaming and disordered animality.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, so you've come back at last,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William. <div class="bookquote">``The favourite was
beaten. I suppose you know that a rank outsider won. But what about this
gentleman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Met these `ere ladies on the `ill an' been showing them over the course.
No offence, I hope, guv`nor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>William did not answer, and Bill took leave of Sarah in a manner that told
Esther that they had arranged to meet again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did you pick up that bloke?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>bloke</b></font>) came up and spoke to us, and Esther stopped to speak to the parson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To the parson. What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>The circumstance was explained, and William asked them what they thought
of the racing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We didn't see no racing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>said Sarah; <div class="bookquote">``we was on the `ill on the wooden
`orses. Esther's `orse won. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) got a mug; show the mug, Esther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you saw no Derby after all?''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Saw no racin'!''  (<font color='red'><b>neighbour</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) neighbour; <div class="bookquote">``ain't she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) won the cup?''

 (<font color='red'><b>neighbour</b></font>)</div><p/>The joke was lost on the women, who only perceived that they were being
laughed at.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come up here, Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William; <div class="bookquote">``stand on my box. The `orses are
just going up the course for the preliminary canter. And you, Sarah, take
Teddy's place. Teddy, get down, and let the lady up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, guv`nor. Come up `ere, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is those the `orses?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>said Sarah. <div class="bookquote">``They do seem small.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The ringmen roared. <div class="bookquote">``Not up to those on the `ill, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said one. <div class="bookquote">``Not
such beautiful goers,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said another.

<p/>There were two or three false starts, and then, looking through a
multitude of hats, Esther saw five or six thin greyhound-looking horses.
They passed like shadows, flitted by; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was sorry for the poor
chestnut that trotted in among the crowd.

<p/>This was the last race. Once more the favourite had been beaten; there
were no bets to pay, and the bookmakers began to prepare for departure. It
was the poor little clerks who were charged with the luggage. Teddy did
not seem as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) would ever reach the top of the hill. With Esther and
Sarah on either arm, William struggled with the crowd. It was hard to get
through the block of carriages. Everywhere horses waited with their
harness on, and Sarah was afraid of being bitten or kicked. A young
aristocrat cursed them from the box-seat, and the groom blew a blast as
the drag rolled away. It was like the instinct of departure which takes a
vast herd at a certain moment. The great landscape, half country, half
suburb, glinted beneath the rays of a setting sun; and through the white
dust, and the drought of the warm roads, the brakes and carriages and
every crazy vehicle rolled towards London; orange-sellers, tract-sellers,
thieves, vagrants, gipsies, made for their various quarters--roadside
inns, outhouses, hayricks, hedges, or the railway station. Down the long
hill the vast crowd made its way, humble pedestrians and carriage folk,
all together, as far as the cross-roads. At the <div class="bookquote">``Spread Eagle''  (<font color='red'><b>stoppage the bookmakers</b></font>)</div>there would
be stoppage for a parting drink, there the bookmakers would change their
clothes, and there division would happen in the crowd--half for the
railway station, half for the London road. It was there that the
traditional sports of the road began. A drag, with a band of exquisites
armed with pea-shooters, peppering on costers who were getting angry, and
threatening to drive over the leaders. A brake with two poles erected, and
hanging on a string quite a line of miniature chamber-pots. A horse, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>bookmakers</b></font>) fore-legs clothed in a pair of lady's drawers. Naturally unconscious
of the garment, the horse stepped along so absurdly that Esther and Sarah
thought they'd choke with laughter.

<p/>At the station William halloaed to old John, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) caught sight of on
the platform. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had backed the winner--forty to one about Sultan. It was
Ketley who had persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) to risk half a sovereign on the horse. Ketley
was at the Derby; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) had met him (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) on the course, and Ketley had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) a
wonderful story about a packet of Turkish Delight. The omen had come right
this time, and Journeyman took a back seat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say what you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William, <div class="bookquote">``it is damned strange; and if anyone
did find the way of reading them omens there would be an end of us
bookmakers.''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was only half in earnest, but he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) regretted he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had not met
Ketley. If he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had only had a fiver on the horse--200 to 5!

<p/>They met Ketley at Waterloo, and every one wanted to hear from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) own
lips the story of the packet of Turkish Delight. So William proposed they
should all come up to the <div class="bookquote">``King's Head''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>for a drink. The omnibus took them
as far as Piccadilly Circus; and there the weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) satchel tempted
William to invite them to dinner, regardless of expense.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which is the best dinner here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) asked the commissionaire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The East Room is reckoned the best, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/>The fashion of the shaded candles and the little tables, and the beauty of
an open evening bodice and the black and white elegance of the young men
at dinner, took the servants by surprise, and made them feel that they
were out of place in such surroundings. Old John looked like picking up a
napkin and asking at the nearest table if anything was wanted. Ketley
proposed the grill room, but William, who had had a glass more than was
good for him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) didn't care a damn--that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) could buy up
the whole blooming show. The head-waiter suggested a private room; it was
abruptly declined, and William took up the menu. <div class="bookquote">``Bisque Soup, what's
that? You ought to know, John.''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Waters</b></font>)</div>John shook his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Ris de veau! That
reminds me of when--''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>William stopped and looked round to see if his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
former wife was in the room. Finally, the head-waiter was cautioned to
send them up the best dinner in the place. Allusion was made to the dust
and heat. Journeyman suggested a sluice, and they inquired their way to
the lavatories. Esther and Sarah were away longer than the men, and stood
dismayed at the top of the room till William called for them. The other
guests seemed a little terrified, and the head-waiter, to reassure them,
mentioned that it was Derby Day.

<p/>William had ordered champagne, but it had not proved to any one's taste
except, perhaps, to Sarah, whom it rendered unduly hilarious; nor did the
delicate food afford much satisfaction; the servants played with it, and
left it on their plates; and it was not until William ordered up the
saddle of mutton and carved it himself that the dinner began to take hold
of the company. Esther and Sarah enjoyed the ices, and the men stuck to
the cheese, a fine Stilton, which was much appreciated. Coffee no one
cared for, and the little glasses of brandy only served to augment the
general tipsiness. William hiccupped out an order for a bottle of Jamieson
eight-year-old; but pipes were not allowed, and cigars were voted tedious,
so they adjourned to the bar, where they were free to get as drunk as they
pleased. William said, <div class="bookquote">``Now let's `ear the blo--the bloody omen that put
ye on to Sultan--that blood--packet of Turkish Delight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most extra--most extraordinary thing I ever heard in my life, so yer
`ere?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ketley/Mr. Ketley</b></font>)</div>said Ketley, staring at William and trying to see him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) distinctly.

<p/>William nodded. <div class="bookquote">``How was it? We want to `ear all about it. Do hold yer
tongue, Sarah. I beg pardon, Ketley is go--going to tell us about the
bloody omen. Thought you'd like to he (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>)--ar, old girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a girl home</b></font>)</div><p/>Allusion was made to a little girl coming home from school, and a piece of
paper on the pavement. But Ketley could not concentrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) thoughts on
the main lines of the story, and it was lost in various dissertations. But
the company was none the less pleased with it, and willingly declared that
bookmaking was only a game for mugs. Get on a winner at forty to one, and
you could make as much in one bet as a poor devil of a bookie could in six
months, fagging from race-course to race-course. They drank, argued, and
quarrelled, until Esther noticed that Sarah was looking very pale. Old
John was quite helpless; Journeyman, who seemed to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) was doing,
very kindly promised to look after him (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>).

<p/>Ketley assured the commissionaire that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) was not drunk; and when they got
outside Sarah felt obliged to step aside; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) came back, saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
felt a little better.

<p/>They stood on the pavement's edge, a little puzzled by the brilliancy of
the moonlight. And the three men who followed out of the bar-room were
agreed regarding the worthlessness of life. One said, <div class="bookquote">``I don't think much
of it; all I live for is beer and women.''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>The phrase caught on William's
ear, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Quite right, old mate,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hand to
Bill Evans. <div class="bookquote">``Beer and women, it always comes round to that in the end, but
we mustn't let them hear us say it.''  (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div>The men shook hands, and Bill
promised to see Sarah safely home. Esther tried to interpose, but William
could not be made to understand, and Sarah and Bill drove away together in
a hansom. Sarah dozed off immediately on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) shoulder, and it was
difficult to awaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) when the cab stopped before a house whose
respectability took Bill by surprise.




<p/>XXXIV


<p/>Things went well enough as long as her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) savings lasted. When her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) money was
gone Bill returned to the race-course in the hope of doing a bit of
welshing. Soon after he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``wanted''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>by the police; they escaped to
Belgium, and it devolved on Sarah to support him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>). The hue and cry over,
they came back to London.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had been sitting up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) had come home exasperated and
disappointed. A row soon began; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) would strike her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>).
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) refrained, for fear, perhaps, of the other lodgers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
instead by the arm, dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) down the broken staircase, and pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
into the court. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) heard the retreating footsteps, and saw a cat slink
through a grating, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) wished that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) too could escape from the light
into the dark.

<p/>A few belated women still lingered in the Strand, and the city stood up
like a prison, hard and stark in the cold, penetrating light of morning.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) sat upon a pillar's base, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) eyes turned towards the cabmen's
shelter. The horses munched in their nose-bags, and the pigeons came down
from their roosts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was dressed in an old black dress, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) hands lay
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) knees, and the pose expressed so perfectly the despair and
wretchedness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) soul that a young man in evening clothes, who had
looked sharply at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passed, turned and came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
slipped a shilling into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was too broken-hearted to look up in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked away wondering what was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) story. The disordered
red hair, the thin, freckled face, were expressive, and so too was the
movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) body when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) got up and walked, not knowing and not
caring where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was going. There was sensation of the river in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
thoughts; the river drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) indistinctly remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
would find relief there if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) chose to accept that relief. The water was
blue beneath the sunrise, and it seemed to offer to end her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) life's
trouble. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) could not go on living. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) could not bear with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) life any
longer, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) would not drown herself that morning.
There was not enough will in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) to drown herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was merely half
dead with grief. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) never wanted
to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) again, but that was because he (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had been unlucky. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) ought to
have gone to bed and not waited up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) didn't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was
doing; so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) didn't care for another woman there was hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
might come back to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). The spare trees rustled their leaves in the bright
dawn air, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat down on a bench and watched the lamps going out, and
the river changing from blue to brown. Hours passed, and the same thoughts
came and went, until with sheer weariness of thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fell asleep.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was awakened by the policeman, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) once more continued her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) walk.
The omnibuses had begun; women were coming from market with baskets on
their arms; and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wondered if their lovers and husbands were unfaithful
to them, if they would be received with blows or knocks when they
returned. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) slightest mistakes had often, it seemed, merited a blow; and
God knows she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had striven to pick out the piece of bacon that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would like, and it was not her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fault that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) couldn't get any money
nowhere. Why was he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cruel to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) never would find another woman to
care for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) more than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did... Esther had a good husband, Esther had
always been lucky. Two hours more to wait, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) felt so tired, so
tired. The milk-women were calling their ware--those lusty short-skirted
women that bring an air of country into the meanest alley. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sat down on
a doorstep and looked on the empty Haymarket, vaguely conscious of the low
vice which still lingered there though the morning was advancing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
turned up Shaftesbury Avenue, and from the beginning of Dean Street she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
watched to see if the shutters were yet down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thought they were, and
then saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was mistaken. There was nothing to do but to wait, and
on the steps of the Royalty Theatre she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) waited. The sun was shining, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) watched the cab horses, until the potboy came through and began
cleaning the street lamp. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) didn't care to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) any questions;
dressed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) might answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) rudely. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wanted to see Esther
first. Esther would pity and help her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). So she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not go directly to the
<div class="bookquote">``King's Head,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but went up the street a little way and came back. The
boy's back was turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) peeped through the doors. There was no
one in the bar, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) must go back to the steps of the theatre. A number of
children were playing there, and they did not make way for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to sit
down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was too weary to argue the point, and walked up and down the
street. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looked through the doors a second time Esther was in the
bar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that you, Sarah?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then come in... How is it that we've not seen you all this time? What's
the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been out all night. Bill put me out of doors this morning, and I've
been walking about ever since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bill put you out of doors? I don't understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``You know Bill Evans, the man we met on the race-course, the day we went
to the Derby... It began there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) took me home after your dinner at the
``Criterion.'..<div class="bookquote">'' It has been going on ever since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Lord! ...Tell me about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/>Leaning against the partition that separated the bars, Sarah told how she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) home and gone to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We got on pretty well at first, but the police was after him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), and we made
off to Belgium. There we was very hard up, and I had to go out on the
streets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) made you do that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) couldn't starve, could he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The women</b></font>)</div><p/>The women looked at each other, and then Sarah continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) story. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
told how they had come to London, penniless. <div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) wants to turn
honest,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but luck's been dead against him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)... It's that
difficult for one like him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s been in work, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) can't stick to
it; and now I don't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s doing--no good, I fancy. Last night I
got anxious and couldn't sleep, so I sat up. It was about two when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) came
in. We had a row and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) dragged me downstairs and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) put me out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) never wanted to see my ugly face again. I don't think I'm as bad as
that; I've led a hard life, and am not what I used to be, but it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
who made me what I am. Oh, it don't matter now, it can't be helped, it is
all over with me. I don't care what becomes of me, only I thought I'd like
to come and tell you. We was always friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mustn't give way like that, old girl. You must keep yer pecker up.
You're dead beat... You've been walking about all night, no wonder. You
must come and have some breakfast with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like a cup of tea, Esther. I never touches spirits now. I got
over that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come into the parlour. You'll be better when you've had breakfast. We'll
see what we can do for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Esther, not a word of what I've been telling you to your husband. I
don't want to get Bill into trouble. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)'d kill me. Promise me not to
mention a word of it. I oughtn't to have told you. I was so tired that I
didn't know what I was saying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was plenty to eat--fried fish, a nice piece of steak, tea and
coffee. <div class="bookquote">``You seem to live pretty well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>said Sarah, <div class="bookquote">``It must be nice to
have a servant of one's own. I suppose you're doing pretty well here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, pretty well, if it wasn't for William's health.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter? Ain't he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)'s been very poorly lately. It's very trying work going about from
race-course to race-course, standing in the mud and wet all day long...
He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) caught a bad cold last winter and was laid up with inflammation of the
lungs, and I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) ever quite got over it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) go no more to race meetings?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hasn't been to a race meeting since the beginning of the winter. It

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do 'e drink?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)'s never drunk, but he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) takes too much.

thought he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) could do what he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) liked, great strong-built fellow that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) is,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)'s found out his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) does his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) betting in London now, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther, hesitating--<div class="bookquote">``when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) has any to do.

it up; but trade is bad in this neighbourhood, leastways, with us, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
don't think we could do without it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very hard to keep it dark; some one's sure to crab it and bring the

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther did not answer; the conversation paused, and William entered.
<div class="bookquote">``Halloa! is that you, Sarah? We didn't know what had become of you all
this time.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) noticed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looked like one in trouble, and was very
poorly dressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) noticed that his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) cheeks were thinner than they used to
be, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) broad chest had sunk, and that there seemed to be
strangely little space between it and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) back. Then in brief phrases,
interrupting each other frequently, the women told the story. William
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was a bad lot. I never liked to see him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) inside my bar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther, <div class="bookquote">``that Sarah might remain here for a time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no fear of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) coming after me. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) don't want to see my ugly face
again. Well, let him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) try to find some one who will do for him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) all I have
done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Until she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) gets a situation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther. <div class="bookquote">``I think that'll be the best,
for you to stop here until you get a situation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what about a character?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't say much about what you've been doing this last twelve
months; if many questions are asked, you can say you've been stopping with
us. But you mustn't see that brute again. If he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) ever comes into that `ere
bar, I'll give him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) a piece of my mind. I'd give him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) more than a piece of
my mind if I was the man I was a twelvemonth ago.''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>William coughed, and
Esther looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) anxiously.




<p/>XXXV


<p/>Lacking a parlour on the ground floor for the use of special customers,
William had arranged a room upstairs where they could smoke and drink.
There were tables in front of the windows and chairs against the walls,
and in the middle of the room a bagatelle board.

<p/>When William left off going to race-courses he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had intended to refrain
from taking money across the bar and to do all his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) betting business in
this room.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) thought that it would be safer. But as his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) customers multiplied he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
found that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) could not ask them all upstairs; it attracted more attention
than to take the money quietly across the bar. Nevertheless the room
upstairs had proved a success. A man spent more money if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a room
where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could sit quietly among his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would seated on a
high stool in a public bar, jostled and pushed about; so it had come to be
considered a sort of club room; and a large part of the neighbourhood came
there to read the papers, to hear and discuss the news. And specially
useful it had proved to Journeyman and Stack. Neither was now in
employment; they were now professional backers; and from daylight to dark
they wandered from public-house to public-house, from tobacconist to
barber's shop, in the search of tips, on the quest of stable information
regarding the health of the horses and their trials. But the room upstairs
at the <div class="bookquote">``King's Head''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the centre of their operations. Stack was the
indefatigable tipster, Journeyman was the scientific student of public
form. His (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) memory was prodigious, and it enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) to note an advantage
in the weights which would escape an ordinary observer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) often picked
out horses which, if they did not actually win, nearly always stood at a
short price in the betting before the race.

<p/>The <div class="bookquote">``King's Head''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was crowded during the dinner-hour. Barbers and their
assistants, cabmen, scene-shifters, if there was an afternoon performance
at the theatre, servants out of situation and servants escaped from their
service for an hour, petty shopkeepers, the many who grow weary of the
scant livelihood that work brings them, came there. Eleven o'clock! In
another hour the bar and the room upstairs would be crowded. At present
the room was empty, and Journeyman had taken advantage of the quiet time
to do a bit of work at his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) handicap. All the racing of the last three
years lay within his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) mind's range; he (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) recalled at will every trifling
selling race; hardly ever was he (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) obliged to refer to the Racing Calendar.
Wanderer had beaten Brick at ten pounds. Snow Queen had beaten Shoemaker
at four pounds, and Shoemaker had beaten Wanderer at seven pounds. The
problem was further complicated by the suspicion that Brick could get a
distance of ground better than Snow Queen. Journeyman was undecided. He (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)
stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) short brown moustache with his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) thin, hairy hand, and gnawed
the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) pen. In this moment of barren reflection Stack came into
the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Still at yer `andicap, I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Stack. <div class="bookquote">``How does it work out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>said Journeyman. <div class="bookquote">``But I don't think it will be one of my
best; there is some pretty hard nuts to crack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which are they?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Stack. Journeyman brightened up, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) proceeded
to lay before Stack's intelligence what he (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) termed a <div class="bookquote">``knotty point in
collateral running.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Stack listened with attention, and thus encouraged, Journeyman proceeded
to point out certain distributions of weight which he (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) said seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)
difficult to beat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anyone what knows the running would say there wasn't a pin to choose
between them at the weights. If this was the real `andicap, I'd bet drinks
all around that fifteen of these twenty would accept. And that's more than
anyone will be able to say for Courtney's `andicap. The weights will be
out to-morrow; we shall see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you say to `alf a pint,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Stack, <div class="bookquote">``and we'll go steadily
through your `andicap? You've nothing to do for the next `alf-hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div><p/>Journeyman's dingy face lit up. When the potboy appeared in answer to the
bell he (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) was told to bring up two half-pints, and Journeyman read out the
weights. Every now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) stopped to explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) reasons for what
might seem to be superficial, an unmerited severity, or an undue leniency.
It was not usual for Journeyman to meet with so sympathetic a listener; he (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)
had often been made to feel that his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) handicapping was unnecessary, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)
now noticed, and with much pleasure, that Stack's attention seemed to
increase rather than to diminish as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stack</b></font>) approached the end. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Stack</b></font>) had
finished Stack said, <div class="bookquote">``I see you've given six-seven to Ben Jonson. Tell me
why you did that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jonson</b></font>) was a good `orse once; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonson</b></font>)'s broken down and aged; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonson</b></font>) can't be trained,
so six-seven seems just the kind of weight to throw him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonson</b></font>) in at. You
couldn't give him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonson</b></font>) less, however old and broken down he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonson</b></font>) may be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jonson</b></font>) was a
good horse when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonson</b></font>) won the Great Ebor Grand Cup.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think if they brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonson</b></font>) to the post as fit and well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonson</b></font>) was
the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonson</b></font>) won the Ebor that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonson</b></font>)'d win?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, fit and well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonson</b></font>) was when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonson</b></font>) won the Great Ebor, and with
six-seven on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonson</b></font>) back? He (<font color='blue'><b>Jonson</b></font>)'d walk away with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't think any of the three-year-olds would have a chance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonson</b></font>)?
A Derby winner with seven stone on his (<font color='blue'><b>winner</b></font>) back might beat him (<font color='blue'><b>winner</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but nothing short of that. Even then old Ben would make a race of
it. A nailing good horse once. A little brown horse about fifteen two, as
compact as a leg of Welsh mutton... But there's no use in thinking of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>). They've been trying for years to train him (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>). Didn't they used to get
the flesh off him (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>) in a Turkish bath? That was Fulton's notion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fulton</b></font>) used to
say that it didn't matter `ow you got the flesh off so long as you got it
off. Every pound of flesh off the lungs is so much wind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fulton</b></font>) used to say.
But the Turkish bath trained horses came to the post limp as old rags. If
a `orse `asn't the legs you can't train him (<font color='blue'><b>Fulton</b></font>). Every pound of flesh yer take
off must put a pound 'o `ealth on. They'll do no good with old Ben, unless
they've found out a way of growing on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) a pair of new forelegs. The old
ones won't do for my money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But do you think that Courtney will take the same view of his (<font color='blue'><b>Courtney</b></font>)
capabilities as you do--do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Courtney</b></font>)'ll let him (<font color='blue'><b>Courtney</b></font>) off as easily as you
have?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Courtney</b></font>) can't give him (<font color='blue'><b>Courtney</b></font>) much more... The `orse is bound to get in at seven
stone, rather under than over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad to `ear yer say so, for I know you've a headpiece, and `as all
the running in there.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Stack tapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Stack</b></font>) forehead. <div class="bookquote">``Now, I'd like to ask
you if there's any three-year-olds that would be likely to interfere with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Courtney</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Derby and Leger winners will get from eight stone to eight stone ten, and
three-year-olds ain't no good over the Cesarewitch course with more than
eight on their backs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The conversation paused. Surprised at Stack's silence, Journeyman said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there anything up? Have you heard anything particular about old Ben?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div><p/>Stack bent forward. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I've heard something, and I'm making inquiries.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you hear it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Stack drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) chair a little closer. ``I've been up at Chalk Farm, the
<div class="bookquote">``Yarborough Arms'; you know, where the `buses stop. Bob Barrett does a
deal of business up there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barrett</b></font>) pays the landlord's rent for the use of the
bar--Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays is his (<font color='blue'><b>Barrett</b></font>) days. Charley Grove bets
there Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, but it is Bob that does the
biggest part of the business. They say he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s taken as much as twenty pounds
in a morning. You know Bob, a great big man, eighteen stun if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s an
ounce. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s a warm `un, can put it on thick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) do tell fine stories about the girls; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) has the pick of
the neighbourhood, wears a low hat, no higher than that, with a big brim.
I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>). I've heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) `as moved up that way. Used at one time to
keep a tobacconist's shop in Great Portland Street.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Stack. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you'd heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There ain't many about that I've not heard of. Not that I likes the man
much. There was a girl I knew--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wouldn't hear his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name mentioned. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lays fair prices, and does, I believe, a big trade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`As a nice `ome at Brixton, keeps a trap; his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) wife as pretty a woman as

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You was up there this morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It wasn't Bob Barrett that gave you the tip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not likely.''  (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div>The men laughed, and then Stack said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know Bill Evans? You've seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) here, always wore a blue Melton
jacket and billycock hat; a dark, stout, good-looking fellow; generally
had something to sell, or pawn-tickets that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would part with for a
trifle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know the fellow. We met him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) down at Epsom one Derby Day. Sarah
Tucker, a friend of the missis, was dead gone on him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tucker</b></font>) went to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). There was a row, and now, I believe,
they're together again; they was seen out walking. They're friends,
anyhow. Bill has been away all the summer, tramping. A bad lot, but one of
them sort often hears of a good thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it was from Bill Evans that you heard it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it was from Bill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) has just come up from Eastbourne, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) `as
been about on the Downs a great deal. I don't know if it was the horses he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)
was after, but in the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) proceedings he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) heard from a shepherd
that Ben Jonson was doing seven hours' walking exercise a day. This seemed
to have fetched Bill a bit. Seven hours a day walking exercise do seem a
bit odd, and being at the same time after one of the servants in the
training stable--as pretty a bit of goods as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) ever set eyes on, so Bill
says--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)'d make an inquiry or two about all this walking
exercise. One of the lads in the stable is after the girl, too, so Bill
found out very soon all he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) wanted to know. As you says, the `orse is dicky
on `is forelegs, that is the reason of all the walking exercise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And they thinks they can bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) fit to the post and win the
Cesarewitch with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) by walking him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) all day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't say they don't gallop him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) at all; they do gallop him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>), but not as
much as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) legs was all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That won't do. I don't believe in a `orse winning the Cesarewitch that
ain't got four sound legs, and old Ben ain't got more than two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)'s had a long rest, and they say he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) is sounder than ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) was since
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) won the Great Ebor. They don't say he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)'d stand no galloping, but they
don't want to gallop him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) more than's absolutely necessary on account of
the suspensory ligament; it ain't the back sinew, but the suspensory
ligament. Their theory is this, that it don't so much matter about
bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) quite fit to the post, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)'s sure to stay the course; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)'d
do that three times over. What they say is this, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) gets in with
seven stone, and we brings him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) well and three parts trained, there ain't
no `orse in England that can stand up before him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>). They've got another in
the race, Laurel Leaf, to make the running for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>); it can't be too strong
for old Ben. You say to yourself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) may get let off with six-seven.
If he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) do there'll be tons of money on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)'ll be backed at the post at
five to one. Before the weights come out they'll lay a hundred to one on
the field in any of the big clubs. I wouldn't mind putting a quid on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)
if you'll join me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Better wait until the weights come out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>said Journeyman, <div class="bookquote">``for if it
happened to come to Courtney's ears that old Ben could be trained he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)'d
clap seven-ten on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) without a moment's hesitation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Stack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>said Journeyman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you agree with me that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) got let off with anything less than
seven stone, and be brought fit, or thereabouts, to the post, that the
race is a moral certainty for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A thousand to a brass farthing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mind, not a word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it likely?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div><p/>The conversation paused a moment, and Journeyman said, <div class="bookquote">``You've not seen my
`andicap for the Cambridgeshire. I wonder what you'd think of that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>Stack
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) would be glad to see it another time, and suggested that they go
downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid the police is in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Stack, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) opened the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we'd better stop where we are; I don't want to be took to the
station.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They listened for some moments, holding the door ajar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It ain't the police,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Stack, <div class="bookquote">``but a row about some bet. Latch had
better be careful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>cause a workman gold</b></font>)</div><p/>The cause of the uproar was a tall young English workman, whose beard was
pale gold, and whose teeth were white. He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) wore a rough handkerchief tied
round his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) handsome throat. His (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) eyes were glassy with drink, and his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>)
comrades strove to quieten him (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave me alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) exclaimed; <div class="bookquote">``the bet was ten half-crowns to one. I
won't stand being welshed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>William's face flushed up. <div class="bookquote">``Welshed!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``No one speaks in this bar
of welshing.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) would have sprung over the counter, but Esther held him (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>)
back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what I'm talking about; you let me alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>the workman</b></font>)</div>said the young workman,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) struggled out of the hands of his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) friends. <div class="bookquote">``The bet was ten
half-crowns to one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't mind what he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) says, guv`nor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't mind what I says!''  (<font color='red'><b>the friends</b></font>)</div>For a moment it seemed as if the friends were
about to come to blows, but the young man's perceptions suddenly clouded,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``In this blo-ody bar last Monday... horse backed in
Tattersall's at twelve to one taken and offered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tattersall</b></font>) don't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tattersall</b></font>)'s talking about; but no one must accuse me of

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No offence, guv`nor; mistakes will occur.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>William could not help laughing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sent Teddy upstairs for Monday's
paper. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) pointed out that eight to one was being asked for about the
horse on Monday afternoon at Tattersall's. The stage door-keeper and a
scene-shifter had just come over from the theatre, and had managed to
force their way into the jug and bottle entrance. Esther and Charles had
been selling beer and spirits as fast as they could draw it, but the
disputed bet had caused the company to forget their glasses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just one more drink,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man. <div class="bookquote">``Take the ten half-crowns out
in drinks, guv`nor, that's good enough. What do you say, guv`nor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, ten half-crowns?''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>William answered angrily. <div class="bookquote">``Haven't I shown you
that the `orse was backed at Tattersall's the day you made the bet at
eight to one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten to one, guv`nor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've not time to go on talking... You're interfering with my business.
You must get out of my bar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who'll put me out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Charles, go and fetch a policeman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At the word <div class="bookquote">``policeman''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man seemed to recover his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wits somewhat,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``You'll bring in no bloody policeman. Fetch a policeman!
and what about your blooming betting--what will become of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>William
looked round to see if there was any in the bar whom he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) could not trust.
He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) knew everyone present, and believed he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) could trust them all. There was
but one thing to do, and that was to put on a bold face and trust to luck.
<div class="bookquote">``Now out you go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, springing over the counter, <div class="bookquote">``and never you set
your face inside my bar again.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Charles followed the guv`nor over the
counter like lightning, and the drunkard was forced into the street. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>)
don't mean no `arm,''  (<font color='red'><b>the friends</b></font>)</div>said one of the friends; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>)'ll come round to-morrow
and apologise for what he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>)'s said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the friends</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) apology,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William. <div class="bookquote">``No one shall call me a welsher
in my bar... Take your friend away, and never let me see him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in my bar
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>Suddenly William turned very pale. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was seized with a fit of coughing,
and this great strong man leaned over the counter very weak indeed. Esther
led him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into the parlour, leaving Charles to attend to the customers. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
hand trembled like a leaf, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sat by his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) side holding it. Mr. Blamy
came in to ask if he (<font color='blue'><b>Blamy</b></font>) should lay one of the young gentlemen from the
tutor's thirty shillings to ten against the favourite. Esther said that
William could attend to no more customers that day. Mr. Blamy returned ten
minutes after to say that there was quite a number of people in the bar;
should he (<font color='blue'><b>Blamy</b></font>) refuse to take their money?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know them all?''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so, guv`nor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be careful to bet with no one you don't know; but I'm so bad I can hardly
speak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much better send them away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then they'll go somewhere else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It won't matter; they'll come back to where they're sure of their money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not so sure of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>William answered, feebly. <div class="bookquote">``I think it will be
all right, Teddy; you'll be very careful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, guv`nor, I'll keep down the price.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Parsons/Parsons</b></font>)</div><p/>XXXVI


<p/>One afternoon Fred Parsons came into the bar of the <div class="bookquote">``King's Head.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Parsons/Parsons</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Parsons</b></font>) wore
the cap and jersey of the Salvation Army; he (<font color='blue'><b>Parsons</b></font>) was now Captain Parsons. The
bars were empty. It was a time when business was slackest. The morning's
betting was over; the crowd had dispersed, and would not collect again
until the _Evening Standard_ had come in. William had gone for a walk.
Esther and the potboy were alone in the house. The potman was at work in
the backyard, Esther was sewing in the parlour. Hearing steps, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) went
into the bar. Fred looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) abashed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was a little perplexed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is your husband in? I should like to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my husband is out. I don't expect him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) back for an hour or so. Can I
give him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) any message?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was on the point of asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was. But there was something so
harsh and formal in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) tone and manner that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) refrained. But the idea
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mind must have expressed itself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) face, for suddenly his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
manner softened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) drew a deep breath, and passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) hand across his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
forehead. Then, putting aside the involuntary thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it will come through you as well as any other way. I had intended
to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), but I can explain the matter better to you... It is
about the betting that is being carried on here. We mean to put a stop to
it. That's what I came to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). It must be put a stop to. No
right-minded person--it cannot be allowed to go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther said nothing; not a change of expression came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) grave face.
Fred was agitated. The words stuck in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) throat, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) hands were
restless. Esther raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) calm eyes, and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) eyes were
pale, restless eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've come to warn you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that the law will be set in motion...
It is very painful for me, but something must be done. The whole
neighbourhood is devoured by it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Esther did not answer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Why
don't you answer, Esther?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is there for me to answer? You tell me that you are going to get up
a prosecution against us. I can't prevent you. I'll tell my husband what
you say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a very serious matter, Esther.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had come into command of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
voice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) spoke with earnest determination. <div class="bookquote">``If we get a conviction
against you for keeping a betting-house, you will not only be heavily
fined, but you will also lose your licence. All we ask is that the betting
shall cease. No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said, interrupting, <div class="bookquote">``don't deny anything; it is quite
useless, we know everything. The whole neighbourhood is demoralized by
this betting; nothing is thought of but tips; the day's racing--that is
all they think about--the evening papers, and the latest information. You
do not know what harm you're doing. Every day we hear of some new
misfortune--a home broken up, the mother in the workhouse, the daughter on
the streets, the father in prison, and all on account of this betting. Oh,
Esther, it is horrible; think of the harm you're doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred Parsons' high, round forehead, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) weak eyes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) whole face, was
expressive of fear and hatred of the evil which a falsetto voice denounced
with much energy.

<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) seemed to grow nervous and perplexed. Esther was looking at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You don't answer, Esther?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What would you have me answer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You used to be a good, religious woman. Do you remember how we used to
speak when we used to go for walks together, when you were in service in
the Avondale road? I remember you agreeing with me that much good could be
done by those who were determined to do it. You seem to have changed very
much since those days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>For a moment Esther seemed affected by these remembrances. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said
in a low, musical voice--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I've not changed, Fred, but things has turned out different. One
doesn't do the good that one would like to in the world; one has to do the
good that comes to one to do. I've my husband and my boy to look to.
Them's my good. At least, that's how I sees things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred looked at Esther, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) eyes expressed all the admiration and love
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) felt for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) character. <div class="bookquote">``One owes a great deal,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said, ``to
those who are near to one, but not everything; even for their sakes one
should not do wrong to others, and you must see that you are doing a great
wrong to your fellow-creatures by keeping on this betting. Public-houses
are bad enough, but when it comes to gambling as well as drink, there's
nothing for us to do but to put the law in motion. Look you, Esther, there
isn't a shop-boy earning eighteen shillings a week that hasn't been round
here to put his (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) half-crown on some horse. This house is the immoral centre
of the neighbourhood. No one's money is refused. The boy that pawned his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
father's watch to back a horse went to the <div class="bookquote">``King's Head' to put his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) money
on. His (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) father forgave him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) again and again. Then the boy stole from the
lodgers. There was an old woman of seventy-five who got nine shillings a
week for looking after some offices; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had half-a-crown off her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Then the
father told the magistrate that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could do nothing with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) since he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
taken to betting on horse-races. The boy is fourteen. Is it not shocking?
It cannot be allowed to go on. We have determined to put a stop to it.
That's what I came to tell your husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) lips while she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) spoke, <div class="bookquote">``that
it is entirely for the neighbourhood that you want to get up the
prosecution?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't think there's any other reason, Esther? You surely don't think
that I'm doing this because--because he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) took you away from me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther didn't answer. And then Fred said, and there was pain and pathos in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry you think this of me; I'm not getting up the
prosecution. I couldn't prevent the law being put in motion against you
even if I wanted to... I only know that it is going to be put in motion,
so for the sake of old times I would save you from harm if I could. I came
round to tell you if you did not put a stop to the betting you'd get into
trouble. I have no right to do what I have done, but I'd do anything to
save you and yours from harm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Parsons/Parsons</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry for what I said. It was very good of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have not any proofs as yet; we know, of course, all about the betting,
but we must have sworn testimony before the law can be set in motion, so
you'll be quite safe if you can persuade your husband to give it up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther did not answer. <div class="bookquote">``It is entirely on account of the friendship I feel
for you that made me come to warn you of the danger. You don't bear me any
ill-will, Esther, I hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Fred, I don't. I think I understand.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The conversation paused again.
<div class="bookquote">``I suppose we have said everything.''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) face from him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>). Fred
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and though her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes were averted from him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could see
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). In another moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was gone. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) plain and
ignorant way she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thought on the romance of destiny. For if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had married
Fred her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) life would have been quite different. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would have led the life
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wished to lead, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had married William and--well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) must
do the best she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could. If Fred, or Fred's friends, got the police to
prosecute them for betting, they would, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said, not only have to pay a
heavy fine, but would probably lose their licence. Then what would they
do? William had not health to go about from race-course to race-course as
he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) used to. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had lost a lot of money in the last six months; Jack was at
school--they must think of Jack. The thought of their danger lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
heart all that evening. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had had no opportunity of speaking to
William alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had to wait until they were in their room. Then, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
untied the strings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) petticoats, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had a visit from Fred Parsons this afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the fellow you were engaged to marry. Is he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) after you still?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) came to speak to me about the betting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About the betting--what is it to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) says that if it isn't stopped that we shall be prosecuted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) came here to tell you that, did he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)? I wish I had been in the bar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad you wasn't. What good could you have done? To have a row and
make things worse!''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>William lit his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) pipe and unlaced his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) boots. Esther slipped on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
night-dress and got into a large brass bedstead, without curtains. On the
chest of drawers Esther had placed the books her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mother had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and
William had hung some sporting prints on the walls. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
night-shirt from the pillow and put it on without removing his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) pipe from
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mouth. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) always finished his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) pipe in bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is revenge,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, pulling the bed-clothes up to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) chin, <div class="bookquote">``because
I got you away from him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it is that; I did think so at first, and I said so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was sorry I thought so badly of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>); that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) came to warn us
of our danger. If he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had wanted to do us an injury he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wouldn't have said
nothing about it. Don't you think so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems reasonable. Then what do you think they're doing it for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) says that keeping a betting-house is corruption in the neighbourhood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) thinks that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) do; and there is many like him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). I come of them that thinks like
that, so I know. Betting and drink is what my folk, the Brethren, holds as
most evil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you've forgot all about them Brethren?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, one never forgets what one's brought up in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what do you think now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've never said nothing about it. I don't believe in a wife interfering
with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband; and business was that bad, and your `ealth `asn't been
the same since them colds you caught standing about in them betting rings,
so I don't see how you could help it. But now that business is beginning
to come back to us, it might be as well to give up the betting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``It is the betting that brings the business; we shouldn't take five pounds
a week was it not for the betting. What's the difference between betting
on the course and betting in the bar? No one says nothing against it on
the course; the police is there, and they goes after the welshers and
persecutes them. Then the betting that's done at Tattersall's and the
Albert Club, what is the difference? The Stock Exchange, too, where
thousands and thousands is betted every day. It is the old story--one law
for the rich and another for the poor. Why shouldn't the poor man `ave his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
`alf-crown's worth of excitement? The rich man can have his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thousand
pounds' worth whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleases. The same with the public
`ouses--there's a lot of hypocritical folk that is for docking the poor
man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beer, but there's no one that's for interfering with them that
drink champagne in the clubs. It's all bloody rot, and it makes me sick
when I think of it. Them hypocritical folk. Betting! Isn't everything
betting? How can they put down betting? Hasn't it been going on since the
world began? Rot, says I! They can just ruin a poor devil like me, and
that's about all. We are ruined, and the rich goes scot-free.
Hypocritical, mealy-mouthed lot. <div class="bookquote">``Let's say our prayers and sand
the sugar'; that's about it. I hate them that is always prating out
religion. When I hears too much religion going about I says now's the time
to look into their accounts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>William leaned out of bed to light his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) pipe from the candle on the
night-table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's good people in the world, people that never thinks but of doing
good, and do not live for pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther. Their only pleasure

whether they win or lose they `as their money's worth. You know what I say
is true; you've seen them, how they look forward to the evening paper to
see how the `oss is going on in betting. Man can't live without hope. It
is their only hope, and I says no one has a right to take it from them.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What about their poor wives? Very little good their betting is to them.
It's all very well to talk like that, William, but you know, and you can't
say you don't, that a great deal of mischief comes of betting; you know
that once they think of it and nothing else, they neglect their work.
There's Stack, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)'s lost his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) place as porter; there's Journeyman, too,

terrible life she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s `ad of it. You says that no `arm comes of it. What
about that boy that was `ad up the other day, and said that it was all
through betting? He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) began by pawning his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father's watch. It was here that
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) made the first bet. You won't tell me that it is right to bet with bits

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther turned round and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes met her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) husband's. There was a strange
remoteness in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) look, and they seemed very far from each other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was brought up to think so differently,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thoughts going

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>William lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) back, and blew the smoke swiftly from his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you smoke much more we shan't be able to breathe in this room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>When the room was in darkness, just before they settled their faces on the
pillow for sleep, William said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was good of that fellow to come and warn us. I must be very careful

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>XXXVII


<p/>On Sunday, as soon as dinner was over, Esther had intended to go to East
Dulwich to see Mrs. Lewis. But as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) closed the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) saw
Sarah coming up the street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I see you're going out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It don't matter; won't you come in, if it's only for a minute?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you, I won't keep you. But which way are you going? We might go
a little way together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked down Waterloo Place and along Pall Mall. In Trafalgar Square
there was a demonstration, and Sarah lingered in the crowd so long that
when they arrived at Charing Cross, Esther found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not get to
Ludgate Hill in time to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) train, so they went into the Embankment
Gardens. It had been raining, and the women wiped the seats with their
handkerchiefs before sitting down. There was no fashion to interest them,
and the band sounded foolish in the void of the grey London Sunday.
Sarah's chatter was equally irrelevant, and Esther wondered how Sarah
could talk so much about nothing, and regretted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) visit to East Dulwich
more and more. Suddenly Bill's name came into the conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I thought you didn't see him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) any more; you promised us you wouldn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't help it... It was quite an accident. One day, coming back
from church with Annie--that's the new housemaid--he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) came up and spoke to
us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``How are ye?... Who'd thought of meeting you!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what did you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said I didn't want to have nothing to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). Annie walked on, and
then he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was very sorry, that it was bad luck that drove him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you believed him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I daresay it is very foolish of me. But one can't help oneself. Did you
ever really care for a man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/>And without waiting for an answer, Sarah continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) babbling chatter.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) not to come after her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) was sorry for what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) had done. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) mentioned incidentally that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) had been away in the
country and had come back with very particular information regarding a
certain horse for the Cesarewitch. If the horse won he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)'d be all right.

<p/>At last Esther's patience was tired out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be getting late,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, looking towards where the sun was
setting. The river rippled, and the edges of the warehouses had
perceptibly softened; a wind, too, had come up with the tide, and the
women shivered as they passed under the arch of Waterloo Bridge. They
ascended a flight of high steps and walked through a passage into the
Strand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was miserable enough with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); we used to have hardly anything to eat;
but I'm more miserable away from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Esther, I know you'll laugh at me,
but I'm that heart-broken... I can't live without him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)... I'd do anything
for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) isn't worth it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That don't make no difference. You don't know what love is; a woman who
hasn't loved a man who don't love her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), don't. We used to live near here.
Do you mind coming up Drury Lane? I should like to show you the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid it will be out of our way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it won't. Round by the church and up Newcastle Street... Look,
there's a shop we used to go to sometimes. I've eaten many a good sausage
and onions in there, and that's a pub where we often used to go for a
drink.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The courts and alleys had vomited their population into the Lane. Fat
girls clad in shawls sat around the slum opening nursing their babies. Old
women crouched in decrepit doorways, fumbling their aprons; skipping ropes
whirled in the roadway. A little higher up a vendor of cheap ices had set
up his (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) store and was rapidly absorbing all the pennies of the
neighborhood. Esther and Sarah turned into a dilapidated court, where a
hag argued the price of trotters with a family leaning one over the other
out of a second-floor window. This was the block in which Sarah had lived.
A space had been cleared by the builder, and the other side was shut in by
the great wall of the old theatre.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's where we used to live,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>said Sarah, pointing up to the third
floor. <div class="bookquote">``I fancy our house will soon come down. When I see the old place it
all comes back to me. I remember pawning a dress over the way in the lane;
they would only lend me a shilling on it. And you see that shop--the
shutters is up, it being Sunday; it is a sort of butcher's, cheap meat,
livers and lights, trotters, and such-like. I bought a bullock's heart
there, and stewed it down with some potatoes; we did enjoy it, I can tell
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/>Sarah talked so eagerly of herself that Esther had not the heart to
interrupt her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). They made their way out into Catherine Street, and then to
Endell Street, and then going round to St. Giles' Church, they plunged
into the labyrinth of Soho.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I'm tiring you. I don't see what interest all this can be to
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We've known each other a long time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/>Sarah looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), and then, unable to resist the temptation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) narrative--Bill had said this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had said that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
rattled on, until they came to the corner of Old Compton Street. Esther,
who was a little tired of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you must be
getting back; would you like a drop of something?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is going on for seven o'clock; but since you're that kind I think I'd
like a glass of beer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you listen much to the betting talk here of an evening?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>Sarah asked,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was leaving.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't pay much attention, but I can't help hearing a good deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do they talk much about Ben Jonson for the Cesarewitch?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They do, indeed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonson</b></font>)'s all the go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/>Sarah's face brightened perceptibly, and Esther said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you backed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonson</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only a trifle; half-a-crown that a friend put me on. Do they say he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'ll
win?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They say that if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) don't break down he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'ll win by `alf a mile; it all

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) coming on in the betting?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I believe they're now taking 12 to 1 about him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). But I'll ask
William, if you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, I only wanted to know if you'd heard anything new.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/>XXXVIII


<p/>During the next fortnight Sarah came several times to the <div class="bookquote">``King's Head.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) came in about nine in the evening, and stayed for half-an-hour or
more. The ostensible object of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) visit was to see Esther, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
declined to come into the private bar, where they would have chatted
comfortably, and remained in the public bar listening to the men's
conversation, listening and nodding while old John explained the horse's
staying power to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). On the following evening all her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) interest was in
Ketley. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wanted to know if anything had happened that might be
considered as an omen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had dreamed about the race, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
dream was only a lot of foolish rubbish without head or tail. Ketley
argued earnestly against this view of a serious subject, and in the hope
of convincing her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) error offered to walk as far as Oxford Street
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) `bus. But on the following evening all her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
interest was centered in Mr. Journeyman, who declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) could prove
that according to the weight it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) to look more and more like a
certainty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) had let the horse in at six stone ten pounds, the official
handicapper had only given him (<font color='blue'><b>handicapper</b></font>) six stone seven pounds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They is a-sending of him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) along this week, and if the leg don't go it is a
hundred pound to a brass farthing on the old horse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How many times will they gallop him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>Sarah asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) goes a mile and a `arf every day now... The day after to-morrow
they'll try him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), just to see that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hasn't lost his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) turn of speed, and if
he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) don't break down in the trial you can take it from me that it will be
all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When will you know the result of the trial?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I expect a letter on Friday morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Stack. <div class="bookquote">``If you come in in the
evening I'll let you know about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you very much, Mr. Stack. I must be getting home now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going your way, Miss Tucker... If you like, we'll go together, and
I'll tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>handicapper</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``all about the `orse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When they had left the bar the conversation turned on racing as an
occupation for women.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fancy my wife making a book on the course. I bet she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'d overlay it and
then turn round and back the favourite at a shorter price than she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'d been
laying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that we should be any foolisher than you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther;
<div class="bookquote">``don't you never go and overlay your book? What about Syntax and the `orse
you told me about last week?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>William had been heavily hit last week through overlaying his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) book against
a horse he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) didn't believe in, and the whole bar joined in the laugh
against him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't say nothing about bookmaking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>said Journeyman; <div class="bookquote">``but there's a
great many women nowadays who is mighty sharp at spotting a `orse that the
handicapper had let in pretty easy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ketley/Mr. Ketley</b></font>)</div>said Ketley, jerking his (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) thumb in the direction that Stack and
Sarah had gone, <div class="bookquote">``seems to `ave got hold of something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must ask Stack when he (<font color='blue'><b>handicapper</b></font>) comes back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>and Journeyman winked at William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Women do get that excited over trifles,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Waters</b></font>)</div>old John remarked,
sarcastically. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) ain't got above `alf-a-crown on the `orse, if that.
She (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) don't care about the `orse or the race--no woman ever did; it's all
about some sweetheart that's been piling it on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder if you're right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther, reflectively. <div class="bookquote">``I never knew her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>)
before to take such an interest in a horse-race.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/>On the day of the race Sarah came into the private bar about three
o'clock. The news was not yet in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't you like to step into the parlour; you'll be more comfortable?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No thank you, dear; it is not worth while. I thought I'd like to know
which won, that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you much on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, five shillings altogether... But a friend of mine stands to win a
good bit. I see you've got a new dress, dear. When did you get it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've had the stuff by me some time. I only had it made up last month. Do
you like it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/>Sarah answered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) thought it very pretty. But Esther could see that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was thinking of something quite different.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The race is over now. It's run at half-past two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but they're never quite punctual; there may be a delay at the post.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see you know all about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One never hears of anything else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther asked Sarah when her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) people came back to town, and was surprised at
the change of expression that the question brought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) friend's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're expected back to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Why do you ask?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing; something to say, that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div><p/>The conversation paused, and the two women looked at each other. At that
moment a voice coming rapidly towards them was heard calling, <div class="bookquote">``Win-ner,
win-ner!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll send out for the paper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no... Suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) shouldn't have won?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it won't make any difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Esther, no; some one will come in and tell us. The race can't be over
yet; it is a long race, and takes some time to run.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>By this time the boy was far away, and fainter and fainter the terrible
word, <div class="bookquote">``Win-ner, win-ner, win-ner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's too late now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>said Sarah; <div class="bookquote">``some one'll come in presently and tell
us about it... I daresay it ain't the paper at all. Them boys cries out
anything that will sell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Win-ner, win-ner.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The voice was coming towards them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has won, Bill and I is to marry... Somehow I feel as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)
hasn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Win-ner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall soon know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther took a halfpenny from the till.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think we'd better wait? It can't be printed in the papers, not
the true account, and if it was wrong--''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther didn't answer; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) gave
Charles the halfpenny; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went out, and in a few minutes came back with
the paper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``Tornado first, Ben Jonson second, Woodcraft
third,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) read out. <div class="bookquote">``That's a good thing for the guv`nor. There was very
few what backed Tornado... He (<font color='blue'><b>guv</b></font>)'s only lost some place-money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>guv</b></font>) was only second,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>said Sarah, turning deadly pale. <div class="bookquote">``They said he (<font color='blue'><b>guv</b></font>)
was certain to win.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you've not lost much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther. <div class="bookquote">``It wasn't with William that
you backed him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it wasn't with William. I only had a few shillings on. It don't
matter. Let me have a drink.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What will you have?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some whisky.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/>Sarah drank it neat. Esther looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) doubtfully.

<p/>The bars would be empty for the next two hours; Esther wished to utilize
this time; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had some shopping to do, and asked Sarah to come with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>).
But Sarah complained of being tired, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) would see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
came back.

<p/>Esther went out a little perplexed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was detained longer than she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
expected, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) returned Sarah was staggering about in the
bar-room, asking Charles for one more drink.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All bloody rot; who says I'm drunk? I ain't... look at me. The `orse did
not win, did he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)? I say he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) did; papers all so much bloody rot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sarah, what is this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's this? Leave go, I say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Stack, won't you ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) to come upstairs?... Don't encourage her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upstairs? I'm a free woman. I don't want to go upstairs. I'm a free
woman; tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) said, balancing herself with difficulty and staring
at Esther with dull, fishy eyes, <div class="bookquote">``tell me if I'm not a free woman? What do
I want upstairs for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sarah, come upstairs and lie down. Don't go out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going home. Hands off, hands off!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, slapping Esther's hands
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) arm.

<p/>''`For every one was drunk last night,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen! Come and have a drink, old gal, just another drink.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
staggered up to the counter. <div class="bookquote">``One more, just for luck; do yer `ear?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>Before Charles could stop her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had seized the whisky that had just been
served. <div class="bookquote">``That's my whisky,''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Journeyman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) made a rapid
movement, but was too late. Sarah had drained the glass and stood vacantly
looking into space. Journeyman seemed so disconcerted at the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)
whisky that every one laughed.

<p/>A few moments after Sarah staggered forward and fell insensible into his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)
arms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) and Esther carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) upstairs and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) on the bed in the
spare room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)'ll be precious bad to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>said Journeyman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know how you could have gone on helping her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther said to
Charles when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) got inside the bar; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) seemed so pained that out of
deference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) feelings the subject was dropped out of the conversation.
Esther felt that something shocking had happened. Sarah had deliberately
got drunk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) would not have done that unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had some great trouble
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) mind. William, too, was of this opinion. Something serious must
have happened. As they went up to their room Esther said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all the fault of this betting. The neighbourhood is completely
ruined. They're losing their `omes and their furniture, and you'll bear
the blame of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It do make me so wild to hear you talkin' that way, Esther. People will
bet, you can't stop them. I lays fair prices, and they're sure of their

to bear the blame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When they got to the top of the stairs she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go and see how Sarah is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where am I? What's happened?... Take that candle out of my eyes... Oh,
my head is that painful.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) fell back on the pillow, and Esther thought
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had gone to sleep again. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Where am I?
...That's you, Esther?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Can't you remember?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I can't. I remember that the `orse didn't win, but don't remember
nothing after... I got drunk, didn't I? It feels like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The `orse didn't win, and then you took too much. It's very foolish of
you to give way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give way! Drunk, what matter? I'm done for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you lose much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It wasn't what I lost, it was what I took. I gave Bill the plate to

talk about it. I got drunk so that I shouldn't think of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sarah, I didn't think it was as bad as that. You must tell me all
about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to think about it. They'll come soon enough to take me away.
Besides, I cannot remember nothing now. My mouth's that awful--Give me a
drink. Never mind the glass, give me the water-bottle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) drank ravenously, and seemed to recover a little. Esther pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) about the pledged plate. <div class="bookquote">``You know that I'm your friend. You'd
better tell me. I want to help you out of this scrape.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one can help me now, I'm done for. Let them come and take me. I'll go

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much is it in for? Don't cry like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) took
out her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) handkerchief and wiped Sarah's eyes. <div class="bookquote">``How much is it in for?
Perhaps I can get my husband to lend me the money to get it out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no use trying to help me... Esther, I can't talk about it now; I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me how much you got on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thirty pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It took a long time to undress her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). Every now and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) made an effort,
and another article of clothing was got off. When Esther returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
room William was asleep, and Esther took him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) by the shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is more serious than I thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) shouted. <div class="bookquote">``I want to tell you
about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What about it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) has pledged the plate for thirty pounds to back that `orse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What `orse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ben Jonson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jonson</b></font>) broke down at the bushes. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonson</b></font>) hadn't I should have been broke up.
The whole neighbourhood was on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonson</b></font>). So she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) pledged the plate to back him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonson</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) didn't do that to back him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonson</b></font>) herself. Some one must have put her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) up to
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it was Bill Evans.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that blackguard put her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) up to it. I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)'d left him (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) for good.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) promised us that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)'d never speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was that fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) couldn't help herself. There's

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much did they get on the plate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thirty pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>William blew a long whistle. Then, starting up in the bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
can't stop here. If it comes out that it was through betting, it won't do
this house any good. We're already suspected. There's that old sweetheart
of yours, the Salvation cove, on the lookout for evidence of betting being
carried on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>)'ll go away in the morning. But I thought that you might lend her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) the
money to get the plate out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! thirty pounds?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a deal of money, I know; but I thought that you might be able to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but think of all I've lost this summer. This is the first bit of

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you might be able to manage it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther stood by the bedside, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knee leaned against the edge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) seemed
to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) at that moment as the best woman in the world, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thirty pounds is no more to me than two-pence-halfpenny if you wish it,
Esther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't been an extravagant wife, have I?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, getting into bed
and taking him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) arms. <div class="bookquote">``I never asked you for money before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)'s my
friend--she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)'s yours too--we've known her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) all our lives. We can't see her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
go to prison, can we, Bill, without raising a finger to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had never called him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) Bill before, and the familiar abbreviation
touched him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I owe everything to you, Esther; everything that's mine is yours. But,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, drawing away so that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) might see her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) better, <div class="bookquote">``what do you say if
I ask something of you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you going to ask me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want you to say that you won't bother me no more about the betting. You
was brought up to think it wicked. I know all that, but you see we can't
do without it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't the thirty pounds you're asking for Sarah come out of betting?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most certainly it do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help feeling, Bill, that we shan't always be so lucky as we have
been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean that you think that one of these days we shall have the police
down upon us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you sometimes think that we can't always go on without being

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They've been down on a great number lately, but what can I do? We always
come back to that. I haven't the health to work round from race-course to
race-course as I used to. But I've got an idea, Esther. I've been thinking
over things a great deal lately, and--give me my pipe--there, it's just by
you. Now, hold the candle, like a good girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>William pulled at his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) pipe until it was fully lighted. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) threw himself on
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) back, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been thinking things over. The betting `as brought us a nice bit of
trade here. If we can work up the business a bit more we might, let's say
in a year from now, be able to get as much for the `ouse as we gave...
What do you think of buying a business in the country, a `ouse doing a
steady trade? I've had enough of London, the climate don't suit me as it
used to. I fancy I should be much better in the country, somewhere on the
South Coast. Bournemouth way, what do you think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Before Esther could reply William was taken with a fit of coughing, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) great broad frame was shaken as if it were so much paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther, when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had recovered himself a little, <div class="bookquote">``that a
good deal of your trouble comes from that pipe. It's never out of your
mouth... I feel like choking myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I daresay I smoke too much... I'm not the man I was. I can feel it plain
enough. Put my pipe down and blow out the candle... I didn't ask you how
Sarah was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very bad. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was half dazed and didn't tell me much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) didn't tell you where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had pledged the plate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I will ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) about that to-morrow morning.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Leaning forward she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
blew out the candle. The wick smouldered red for a moment, and they fell
asleep happy in each other's love, seeming to find new bonds of union in
pity for their friend's misfortune.




<p/>XXXIX


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sarah, you must make an effort and try to dress yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I do feel that bad, I wish I was dead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not give way like that; let me help you put on your stockings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/>Sarah looked at Esther. <div class="bookquote">``You're very good to me, but I can manage.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had drawn on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) stockings her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) strength was exhausted, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) fell
back on the pillow.

<p/>Esther waited a few minutes. <div class="bookquote">``Here're your petticoats. Just tie them round
you; I'll lend you a dressing-gown and a pair of slippers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>William was having breakfast in the parlour. <div class="bookquote">``Well, feeling a bit poorly?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said to Sarah. <div class="bookquote">``What'll you have? There's a nice bit of fried fish. Not
feeling up to it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no! I couldn't touch anything.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) let herself drop on the sofa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A cup of tea'll do you good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther. <div class="bookquote">``You must have a cup of tea,
and a bit of toast just to nibble. William, pour her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) out a cup of tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had drunk the tea she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) felt a little better.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William, <div class="bookquote">``let's `ear all about it. Esther has told you, no
doubt, that we intend to do all we can to help you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't help me... I'm done for,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) replied dolefully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William. <div class="bookquote">``You gave that brute Bill Evans
the plate to pawn, so far as I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There isn't much more to tell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) said the horse was sure to win. He (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) was
at thirty to one at that time. A thousand to thirty. Bill said with that
money we could buy a public-house in the country. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) wanted to settle
down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) wanted to get out of--I don't want to say nothing against him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)
said if I would only give him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) this chance of leading a respectable life,
we was to be married immediately after.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) told you all that, did he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)'d give you a `ome of your own, I
know. A regular rotter; that man is about as bad as they make 'em. And you
believed it all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``It wasn't so much what I believed as what I couldn't help myself. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
got that influence over me that my will wasn't my own. I don't know how it
is--I suppose men have stronger natures than women. I `ardly knew what I
was doing; it was like sleep-walking. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at me and said, ``You'd
better do it.<div class="bookquote">'' I did it, and I suppose I'll have to go to prison for it.
What I says is just the truth, but no one believes tales like that. How
long do you think they'll give me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope we shall be able to get you out of this scrape. You got thirty
pounds on the plate. Esther has told you that I'm ready to lend you the
money to get it out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you do this? You're good friends indeed... But I shall never be
able to pay you back such a lot of money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We won't say nothing about paying back; all we want you to do is to say
that you'll never see that fellow again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/>A change of expression came over Sarah's face, and William said, <div class="bookquote">``You're
surely not still hankering after him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed I'm not. But whenever I meets him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) somehow gets his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) way with
me. It's terrible to love a man as I love him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). I know he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) don't really care
for me--I know he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is all you say, and yet I can't help myself. It is
better to be honest with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>William looked puzzled. At the end of a long silence he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``If it's
like that I don't see that we can do anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have patience, William. Sarah don't know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)'s saying. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)'ll
promise not to see him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're very kind to me. I know I'm very foolish. I promised before not to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can stop with us until you get a situation in the country,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said
Esther, <div class="bookquote">``where you'll be out of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I might do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like to part with my money,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William, <div class="bookquote">``if it is to do no one
any good.''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>Esther looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``It is just as Esther
wishes, of course; I'm not giving you the money, it is she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is both of us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther; <div class="bookquote">``you'll do what I said, Sarah?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, anything you say, Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) flung herself into her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
friend's arms and wept bitterly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now we want to know where you pawned the plate,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A long way from here. Bill said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) knew a place where it would be quite
safe. I was to say that my mistress left it to me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) said that would be
sufficient... It was in the Mile End Road.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd know the shop again?''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)'s got the ticket,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I ain't got the ticket; Bill has it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'm afraid the game's up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do be quiet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther, angrily. <div class="bookquote">``If you want to get out of lending
the money say so and have done with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not true, Esther. If you want another thirty to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) to give up
the ticket, you can have it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) husband with one quick look. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``my
temper is that hasty. But you know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) lives,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, turning to
the wretched woman who sat on the sofa pale and trembling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) lives--13 Milward Square, Mile End Road.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we've no time to lose; we must go after him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, William dear; you must not; you'd only lose your temper, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) might
do you an injury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An injury! I'd soon show him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) which was the best man of the two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll not hear of it, Sarah. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mustn't go with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Esther, don't be foolish. Let me go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hat from the peg. Esther got between him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) and the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I forbid it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I will not let you go--perhaps to have a fight,
and with that cough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>William was coughing. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had turned pale, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, leaning against the
table, <div class="bookquote">``Give me something to drink, a little milk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther poured some into a cup. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sipped it slowly. <div class="bookquote">``I'll go upstairs,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``for my hat and jacket. You've got your betting to attend to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>William smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Sarah, mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)'s not to go with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You forget what you said last night about the betting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind what I said last night about the betting; what I say now is
that you're not to leave the bar. Come upstairs, Sarah, and dress
yourself, and let's be off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div><p/>Stack and Journeyman were waiting to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). They had lost heavily
over old Ben and didn't know how they'd pull through; and the whole
neighbourhood was in the same plight; the bar was filled with gloomy
faces.

<p/>And as William scanned their disconcerted faces--clerks, hair-dressers,
waiters from the innumerable eating houses--he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) could not help thinking
that perhaps more than one of them had taken money that did not belong to
them to back Ben Jonson. The unexpected disaster had upset all their
plans, and even the wary ones who had a little reserve fund could not help
backing outsiders, hoping by the longer odds to retrieve yesterday's
losses. At two the bar was empty, and William waited for Esther and Sarah
to return from Mile End. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) that they were a long time away.
But Mile End is not close to Soho; and when they returned, between four
and five, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) saw at once that they had been unsuccessful. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) lifted up the
flap in the counter and all three went into the parlour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) left Milward Square yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther said. <div class="bookquote">``Then we went to another
address, and then to another; we went to all the places Sarah had been to
with him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), but no tidings anywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/>Sarah burst into tears. <div class="bookquote">``There's no more hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm done for;
they'll come and take me away. How much do you think I'll get? They won't
give me ten years, will they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can see nothing else for you to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther, <div class="bookquote">``but to go straight
back to your people and tell them the whole story, and throw yourself on
their mercy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) should say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) pawned the plate to get money to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will make the police more keen than ever on the betting houses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)'d better not be took here,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William; <div class="bookquote">``it will do a great deal of

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther did not answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go away. I don't want to get no one into trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>Sarah said, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) got up from the sofa.

<p/>At that moment Charles opened the door, and said, <div class="bookquote">``You're wanted in the
bar, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>William went out quickly. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) returned a moment after. There was a scared
look on his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``They're here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was followed by two
policemen. Sarah uttered a little cry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your name is Sarah Tucker?''  (<font color='red'><b>the policeman</b></font>)</div>said the first policeman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

<div class="bookquote">``It will do no good. Why should you go?''




 (<font color='red'><b>XL The magistrate</b></font>)</div><p/>XL


<p/>The magistrate of course sent the case for trial, and the thirty pounds
which William had promised to give to Esther went to pay for the defence.
There seemed at first some hope that the prosecution would not be able to
prove its case, but fresh evidence connecting Sarah with the abstraction
of the plate was forthcoming, and in the end it was thought advisable that
the plea of not guilty should be withdrawn. The efforts of counsel were
therefore directed towards a mitigation of sentence. Counsel called Esther
and William for the purpose of proving the excellent character that the
prisoner had hitherto borne; counsel spoke of the evil influence into
which the prisoner had fallen, and urged that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had no intention of
actually stealing the plate. Tempted by promises, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had been persuaded
to pledge the plate in order to back a horse which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had been told was
certain to win. If that horse had won, the plate would have been redeemed
and returned to its proper place in the owner's house, and the prisoner
would have been able to marry. Possibly the marriage on which the prisoner
had set her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heart would have turned out more unfortunate for the prisoner
than the present proceedings. Counsel had not words strong enough to
stigmatise the character of a man who, having induced a girl to imperil
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) liberty for his (<font color='blue'><b>Counsel</b></font>) own vile ends, was cowardly enough to abandon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in
the hour of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) deepest distress. Counsel drew attention to the trusting
nature of the prisoner, who had not only pledged her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) employer's plate at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Counsel</b></font>) base instigation, but had likewise been foolish enough to confide the
pawn-ticket to his (<font color='blue'><b>Counsel</b></font>) keeping. Such was the prisoner's story, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Counsel</b></font>)
submitted that it bore on the face of it the stamp of truth. A very sad
story, but one full of simple, foolish, trusting humanity, and, having
regard to the excellent character the prisoner had borne, counsel hoped
that his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) lordship would see his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) way to dealing leniently with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) Lordship, whose gallantries had been prolonged over half a century,
and whose betting transactions were matters of public comment, pursed up
his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) ancient lips and fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) dead glassy eyes on the prisoner. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) said
he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) regretted that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) could not take the same view of the prisoner's
character as learned counsel had done. The police had made every effort to
apprehend the man Evans who, according to the prisoner's story, was the
principal culprit. But the efforts of the police had been unavailing; they
had, however, found traces of the man Evans, who undoubtedly did exist,
and need not be considered to be a near relative of our friend Mrs.
Harris. And the little joke provoked some amusement in the court; learned
counsel settled their robes becomingly and leant forward to listen. They
were in for a humorous speech, and the prisoner would get off with a light
sentence. But the grim smile waxed duller, and it was clear that lordship
was determined to make the law a terror to evil-doers. Lordship drew
attention to the fact that during the course of their investigations the
police had discovered that the prisoner had been living for some
considerable time with the man Evans, during which time several robberies
had been effected. There was no evidence, it was true, to connect the
prisoner with these robberies. The prisoner had left the man Evans and had
obtained a situation in the house of her (<font color='blue'><b>police</b></font>) present employers. When the
characters she (<font color='blue'><b>police</b></font>) had received from her (<font color='blue'><b>police</b></font>) former employers were being examined
she (<font color='blue'><b>police</b></font>) had accounted for the year she (<font color='blue'><b>police</b></font>) had spent with the man Evans by saying
that she (<font color='blue'><b>police</b></font>) had been staying with the Latches, the publicans who had given
evidence in her (<font color='blue'><b>police</b></font>) favour. It had also come to the knowledge of the police
that the man Evans used to frequent the <div class="bookquote">``King's Head,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bill/Bill Evans/Evans</b></font>)</div>that was the house
owned by the Latches; it was probable that she (<font color='blue'><b>police</b></font>) had made there the
acquaintance of the man Evans. The prisoner had referred her (<font color='blue'><b>police</b></font>) employers to
the Latches, who had lent their sanction to the falsehood regarding the
year she (<font color='blue'><b>police</b></font>) was supposed to have spent with them, but which she (<font color='blue'><b>police</b></font>) had really
spent in cohabitation with a notorious thief. Here lordship indulged in
severe remarks against those who enabled not wholly irreproachable
characters to obtain situations by false pretences, a very common habit,
and one attended with great danger to society, one which society would do
well to take precautions to defend itself against.

<p/>The plate, his (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) Lordship remarked, was said to have been pawned, but there
was nothing to show that it had been pawned, the prisoner's explanation
being that she (<font color='blue'><b>police</b></font>) had given the pawn-ticket to the man Evans. She (<font color='blue'><b>police</b></font>) could not
tell where she (<font color='blue'><b>police</b></font>) had pawned the plate, her (<font color='blue'><b>police</b></font>) tale being that she (<font color='blue'><b>police</b></font>) and the man
Evans had gone down to Whitechapel together and pawned it in the Mile End
Road. But she (<font color='blue'><b>police</b></font>) did not know the number of the pawnbroker's, nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>police</b></font>)
give any indications as to its whereabouts--beyond the mere fact that it
was in the Mile End Road she (<font color='blue'><b>police</b></font>) could say nothing. All the pawnbrokers in the
Mile End Road had been searched, but no plate answering to the description
furnished by the prosecution could be found.

<p/>Learned counsel had endeavoured to show that it had been in a measure
unpremeditated, that it was the result of a passing but irresistible
temptation. Learned counsel had endeavoured to introduce some element of
romance into the case; he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) had described the theft as the outcome of the
prisoner's desire of marriage, but lordship could not find such purity of
motive in the prisoner's crime. There was nothing to show that there was
any thought of marriage in the prisoner's mind; the crime was the result,
not of any desire of marriage, but rather the result of vicious passion,
concubinage. Regarding the plea that the crime was unpremeditated, it was
only necessary to point out that it had been committed for a distinct
purpose and had been carried out in conjunction with an accomplished
thief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is now only one more point which I wish to refer to, and that is
the plea that the prisoner did not intend to steal the plate, but only to
obtain money upon it to enable her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) and the partner in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) guilt to back a
horse for a race which they believed to be--''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) Lordship was about to
say a certainty for him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) stopped himself, however, in time--<div class="bookquote">``to be, to
be, which they believed him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) to be capable of winning. The race in question
is, I think, called the Cesarewitch, and the name of the horse -LRB-lordship
had lost three hundred on Ben Jonson-RRB-, if my memory serves me right -LRB-here
lordship fumbled amid papers-RRB-, yes, the name is, as I thought, Ben Jonson.
Now, the learned counsel for the defence suggested that, if the horse had
won, the plate would have been redeemed and restored to its proper place
in the pantry cupboards. This, I venture to point out, is a mere
hypothesis. The money might have been again used for the purpose of
gambling. I confess that I do not see why we should condone the prisoner's
offence because it was committed for the sake of obtaining money for
gambling purposes. Indeed, it seems to me a reason for dealing heavily
with the offence. The vice among the poorer classes is largely on the
increase, and it seems to me that it is the duty of all in authority to
condemn rather than to condone the evil, and to use every effort to stamp
it out. For my part I fail to perceive any romantic element in the vice of
gambling. It springs from the desire to obtain wealth without work, in
other words, without payment; work, whether in the past or the present, is
the natural payment for wealth, and any wealth that is obtained without
work is in a measure a fraud committed upon the community. Poverty,
despair, idleness, and every other vice spring from gambling as naturally,
and in the same profusion, as weeds from barren land. Drink, too, is
gambling's firmest ally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment a certain dryness in his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) Lordship's throat reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) of
the pint of excellent claret that lordship always drank with his (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) lunch,
and the thought enabled lordship to roll out some excellent invective
against the evils of beer and spirits. And lordship's losses on the horse
whose name he (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) could hardly recall helped to a forcible illustration of the
theory that drink and gambling mutually uphold and enforce each other.
When the news that Ben Jonson had broken down at the bushes came in,
lordship had drunk a magnum of champagne, and memory of this champagne
inspired a telling description of the sinking feeling consequent on the
loss of a wager, and the natural inclination of a man to turn to drink to
counteract it. Drink and gambling are growing social evils; in a great
measure they are circumstantial, and only require absolute legislation to
stamp them out almost entirely. This was not the first case of the kind
that had come before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); it was one of many, but it was a typical case,
presenting all the familiar features of the vice of which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had therefore
spoken at unusual length. Such cases were on the increase, and if they
continued to increase, the powers of the law would have to be
strengthened. But even as the law stood at present, betting-houses,
public-houses in which betting was carried on, were illegal, and it was
the duty of the police to leave no means untried to unearth the offenders
and bring them to justice. Lordship then glanced at the trembling woman in
the dock. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) condemned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to eighteen months' hard labour, and gathering
up the papers on the desk, dismissed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for ever from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind.

<p/>The court adjourned for lunch, and Esther and William edged their way out
of the crowd of lawyers and their clerks. Neither spoke for some time.
William was much exercised by his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) Lordship's remarks on betting
public-houses, and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) advice that the police should increase their
vigilance and leave no means untried to uproot that which was the curse
and the ruin of the lower classes. It was the old story, one law for the
rich, another for the poor. William did not seek to probe the question any
further, this examination seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to have exhausted it; and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
remembered, after all that the hypocritical judge had said, how difficult
it would be to escape detection. When he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) was caught he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) would be fined a
hundred pounds, and probably lose his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) licence. What would he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) do then? He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)
did not confide his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) fears to Esther. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had promised to say no more about
the betting; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had not changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) opinion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was one of those
stubborn ones who would rather die than admit they were wrong. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)
wondered what she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) Lordship's speech. Esther was thinking of
the thin gruel Sarah would have to eat, the plank bed on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) would
have to sleep, and the miserable future that awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) should
be released from gaol.

<p/>It was a bright winter's day; the City folk were walking rapidly, tightly
buttoned up in top-coats, and in a windy sky a flock of pigeons floated on
straightened wings above the telegraph wires. Fleet Street was full of
journalists going to luncheon-bars and various eating-houses. Their hurry
and animation were remarkable, and Esther noticed how laggard was
William's walk by comparison, how his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) clothes hung loose about him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and
that the sharp air was at work on his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) lungs, making him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) cough. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) asked
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to button himself up more closely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is not that old John's wife?''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'d have seen us if that cove hadn't
given her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the shilling... Lord, I didn't think they was as badly off as
that. Did you ever see such rags? and that thick leg wrapped up in that
awful stocking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Randal</b></font>)</div><p/>The morning had been full of sadness, and Mrs. Randal's wandering rags had
seemed to Esther like a foreboding. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) grew frightened, as the cattle do
in the fields when the sky darkens and the storm draws near. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) suddenly
remembered Mrs. Barfield, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) of the unhappiness
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had seen come from betting. Where was Mrs. Barfield? Should she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>)
ever see her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) again? Mr. Barfield was dead, Miss May was forced to live
abroad for the sake of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) health; all that time of long ago was over and
done with. Some words that Mrs. Barfield had said came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>)
had never quite understood them, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) had never quite forgotten them;
they seemed to chime through her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) life. <div class="bookquote">``My girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barfield/Barfield</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Barfield had said,
<div class="bookquote">``I am more than twenty years older than you, and I assure you that time
has passed like a little dream; life is nothing. We must think of what
comes after.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barfield/Barfield</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cheer up, old girl; eighteen months is a long while, but it ain't a
lifetime. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll get through it all right; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) comes out we'll
try to see what we can do for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>William's voice startled Esther from the depth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) dream; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looked at
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) vaguely, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had been thinking of something different
from what he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had suspected. <div class="bookquote">``I thought it was on account of Sarah that you
was looking so sad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I was not thinking of Sarah.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, taking it for granted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was thinking of the wickedness of
betting, his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) face darkened. It was aggravating to have a wife who was
always troubling about things that couldn't be helped. The first person
they saw on entering the bar was old John; and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sat in the corner of the
bar on a high stool, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) grey, death-like face sunk in the old unstarched
shirt collar. The thin, wrinkled throat was hid with the remains of a
cravat; it was passed twice round, and tied according to the fashions of
fifty years ago. His (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) boots were broken; the trousers, a grey, dirty brown,
were torn as high up as the ankle; they had been mended and the patches
hardly held together; the frock coat, green with age, with huge flaps over
the pockets, frayed and torn, and many sizes too large, hung upon his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
starveling body. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) seemed very feeble, and there was neither light nor
expression in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) glassy, watery eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eighteen months; a devil of a stiff sentence for a first offence,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said
William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I just dropped in. Charles said you'd sure to be back. You're later than
I expected.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We stopped to have a bit of lunch. But you heard what I said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) got
eighteen months.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who got eighteen months?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sarah.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Sarah. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was tried to-day. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) got eighteen months.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter? Wake up; you're half asleep. What will you have to
drink?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A glass of milk, if you've got such a thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Glass of milk! What is it, old man--not feeling well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not very well. The fact is, I'm starving.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Starving! ...Then come into the parlour and have something to eat. Why
didn't you say so before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't like to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) led the old chap into the parlour and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) a chair. <div class="bookquote">``Didn't like to
tell me that you was as hard up as all that? What do you mean? You didn't
use to mind coming round for half a quid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was to back a horse; but I didn't like coming to ask for
food--excuse me, I'm too weak to speak much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>When old John had eaten, William asked how it was that things had gone so
badly with him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've had terrible bad luck lately, can't get on a winner nohow. I have
backed `orses that `as been tried to win with two stone more on their
backs than they had to carry, but just because I was on them they didn't
win. I don't know how many half-crowns I've had on first favourites. Then
I tried the second favourites, but they gave way to outsiders or the first
favourites when I took to backing them. Stack's tips and Ketley's omens
was all the same as far as I was concerned. It's a poor business when
you're out of luck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is giving way to fancy that does for the backers. The bookmaker's
advantage is that he (<font color='blue'><b>bookmaker</b></font>) bets on principle and not on fancy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Old John told how unlucky he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had been in business. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had been dismissed
from his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) employment in the restaurant, not from any fault of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
had done his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) work well. <div class="bookquote">``But they don't like old waiters; there's always a
lot of young Germans about, and customers said I smelt bad. I suppose it
was my clothes and want of convenience at home for keeping one's self
tidy. We've been so hard up to pay the three and sixpence rent which we've
owed, that the black coat and waistkit had to go to the pawnshop, so even
if I did meet with a job in the Exhibition places, where they ain't so
particular about yer age, I should not be able to take it. It's terrible
to think that I should have to come to this and after having worked round
the table this forty years, fifty pounds a year and all found, and
accustomed always to a big footman and page-boy under me. But there's
plenty more like me. It's a poor game. You're well out of it. I suppose
the end of it will be the work`us. I'm pretty well wore out, and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man's voice died away. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) made no allusion to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wife. His (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
dislike to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was part and parcel of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) dislike to speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
private affairs. The conversation then turned on Sarah; the severity of
the sentence was alluded to, and William spoke of how the judge's remarks
would put the police on the watch, and how difficult it would be to
continue his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) betting business without being found out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no doubt that it is most unfortunate,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Waters</b></font>)</div>said old John.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The only thing for you to do is to be very particular about yer
introductions, and to refuse to bet with all who haven't been properly
introduced.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or to give up betting altogether,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give up betting altogether!''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>William answered, his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) face flushed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
gradually worked himself into a passion. <div class="bookquote">``I give you a good `ome, don't I?
You want for nothing, do yer? Well, that being so, I think you might keep
your nose out of your husband's business. There's plenty of
prayer-meetings where you can go preaching if you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>William would have said a good deal more, but his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) anger brought on a fit
of coughing. Esther looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) contemptuously, and without answering
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) walked into the bar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a bad cough of yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Waters</b></font>)</div>said old John.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) drank a little water to pass it off. <div class="bookquote">``I must
see the doctor about it. It makes one that irritable. The missis is in a
pretty temper, ain't she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Old John did not reply; it was not his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) habit to notice domestic
differences of opinion, especially those in which women had a share--queer
cattle that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) knew nothing about. The men talked for a long time
regarding the danger the judge's remarks had brought the house into; and
they considered all the circumstances of the case. Allusion was made to
the injustice of the law, which allowed the rich and forbade the poor to
bet; anecdotes were related, but nothing they said threw new light on the
matter in hand, and when Old John rose to go William summed up the
situation in these few words--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bet I must, if I'm to get my living. The only thing I can do is to be
careful not to bet with strangers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see how they can do nothing to you if yer makes that yer
principle and sticks to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Waters</b></font>)</div>said old John, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) put on the huge-rimmed,
greasy hat, three sizes too large for him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), looking in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) square-cut
tattered frock-coat as queer a specimen of humanity as you would be likely
to meet with in a day's walk. <div class="bookquote">``If you makes that yer principle and sticks
to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>thought William.

<p/>But practice and principle are never reduced to perfect agreement. One is
always marauding the other's territory; nevertheless for several months
principle distinctly held the upper hand; William refused over and over
again to make bets with comparative strangers, but the day came when his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
principle relaxed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) took the money of a man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) thought was all
right. It was done on the impulse of the moment, but the two half-crowns
wrapped up in the paper, with the name of the horse written on the paper,
had hardly gone into the drawer than he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had done wrong. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
couldn't tell why, but the feeling came across him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had done wrong
in taking the man's money--a tall, clean-shaven man dressed in broadcloth.
It was too late to draw back. The man had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beer and had left
the bar, which in itself was suspicious.

<p/>Three days afterwards, between twelve and one, just the busiest time, when
the bar was full of people, there came a cry of <div class="bookquote">``Police!''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>An effort was
made to hide the betting plant; a rush was made for the doors. It was all
too late; the sergeant and a constable ordered that no one was to leave
the house; other police were outside. The names and addresses of all
present were taken down; search was made, and the packets of money and the
betting books were discovered. Then they all had to go to Marlborough
Street.




<p/>XLI


<p/>Next day the following account was given in most of the daily
papers:--``Raid on a betting man in the West End. William Latch, 35,
landlord of the ``King's Head,'' Dean Street, Soho, was charged that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>),
being a licensed person, did keep and use his (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) public-house for the purpose
of betting with persons resorting thereto. Thomas William, 35, billiard
marker, Gaulden Street, Battersea; Arthur Henry Parsons, 25, waiter,
Northumberland Street, Marylebone; Joseph Stack, 52, gentleman; Harold
Journeyman, 45, gentleman, High Street, Norwood; Philip Hutchinson,
grocer, Bisey Road, Fulham; William Tann, piano-tuner, Standard Street,
Soho; Charles Ketley, butterman, Green Street, Soho; John Randal, Frith
Street, Soho; Charles Muller, 44, tailor, Marylebone Lane; Arthur Bartram,
stationer, East Street Buildings; William Burton, harness maker, Blue Lion
Street, Bond Street, were charged with using the ``King's Head' for the
purpose of betting. Evidence was given by the police regarding the room
upstairs, where a good deal of drinking went on after hours. There had
been cases of disorder, and the magistrate unfortunately remembered that a
servant-girl, who had pledged her (<font color='blue'><b>Latch</b></font>) master's plate to obtain money to back a
horse, had been arrested in the <div class="bookquote">``King's Head.''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>Taking these facts into
consideration, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) could not do less than inflict a
fine of #100. The men who were found in Latch's house he (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) ordered to be
bound over.''

<p/>Who had first given information? That was the question. Old John sat
smoking in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) corner. Journeyman leaned against the yellow-painted
partition, his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) legs thrust out. Stack stood square, his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) dark,
crimson-tinted skin contrasting with sallow-faced little Ketley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't the omens throw no light on this `ere matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>said Journeyman.

<p/>Ketley started from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) reverie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William, <div class="bookquote">``if I only knew who the b-- was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ain't you got no idea of any sort?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Stack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was a Salvation chap who came in some months ago and told my wife
that the betting was corrupting the neighbourhood. That it would have to
be put a stop to. It may `ave been `e.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't ask no one to bet with you. They does as they like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does as they like! No one does that nowadays. There's a temperance party,
a purity party, and a hanti-gambling party, and what they is working for
is just to stop folk from doing as they like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>said Journeyman.

<p/>Stack raised his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) glass to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) lips and said, <div class="bookquote">``Here's luck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's not much of that about,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William. <div class="bookquote">``We seem to be losing all
round. I'd like to know where the money goes. I think it is the `ouse;
it's gone unlucky, and I'm thinking of clearing out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We may live in a `ouse a long while before we find what its luck really
is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ketley/Mr. Ketley</b></font>)</div>said Ketley. <div class="bookquote">``I've been in my old `ouse these twenty years, and it
ain't nothing like what I thought it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are that superstitious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>said Journeyman. <div class="bookquote">``If there was anything the
matter with the `ouse you'd've know'd it before now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ain't you doing the trade you was?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Stack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my butter and egg trade have fallen dreadful lately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The conversation paused. It was Stack who broke the silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you intend to do no more betting `ere?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, after being fined #100? You `eard the way he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) went on about Sarah,
and all on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) being took here. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) might have left
Sarah out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It warn't for betting she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) took the plate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>said Journeyman; <div class="bookquote">``it was
'cause her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) chap said if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) did he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'d marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder you ever left the course,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Stack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was on account of my `ealth. I caught a dreadful cold at Kempton,
standing about in the mud. I've never quite got over that cold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ketley/Mr. Ketley</b></font>)</div>said Ketley; <div class="bookquote">``you couldn't speak above a whisper for two
months.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ketley/Mr. Ketley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two months! more like three.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fourteen weeks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was in favour of disposing of the house and going to live in the
country. But it was soon found that the conviction for keeping a
betting-house had spoiled their chance of an advantageous sale. If,
however, the licence were renewed next year, and the business did not in
the meantime decline, they would be in a position to obtain better terms.
So all their energies should be devoted to the improvement of their
business. Esther engaged another servant, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) provided the best meat
and vegetables that money could buy; William ordered beer and spirits of a
quality that could be procured nowhere else in the neighbourhood; but all
to no purpose. As soon as it became known that it was no longer possible
to pass half a crown or a shilling wrapped up in a piece of paper across
the bar, their custom began to decline.

<p/>At last William could stand it no longer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) obtained his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) wife's
permission to once more begin book-making on the course. His (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) health had
begun to improve with the spring weather, and there was no use keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
at home eating his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) heart out with vexation because they were doing no
business. So did Esther reason, and it reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) of old times when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
came back with his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) race-glasses slung round his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``Favourites all
beaten today; what have you got for me to eat, old girl?''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther forgot
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) dislike of racing in the joy of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) husband happy, if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'d only
pick up a bit of flesh; but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) seemed to get thinner and thinner, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
food didn't seem to do him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) any good.

<p/>One day he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) came home complaining that the ring was six inches of soft mud;
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was wet to the skin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sat shivering the whole evening, with the
sensation of a long illness upon him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was laid up for several weeks,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) voice seemed as if it would never return to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) again. There was
little or no occupation for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in the bar; and instead of laying he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) began
to take the odds. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) backed a few winners, it is true; but they could not
rely on that. Most of their trade had slipped from them, so it did not
much matter to them if they were found out. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might as well be hung for
an old sheep as a lamb, and surreptitiously at first, and then more
openly, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) began to take money across the bar, and with every shilling he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
took for a bet another shilling was spent in drink. Custom came back in
ripples, and then in stronger waves, until once again the bar of the
<div class="bookquote">``King's Head''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was full to overflowing. Another conviction meant ruin, but
they must risk it, so said William; and Esther, like a good wife,
acquiesced in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) husband's decision. But he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) took money only from those
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was quite sure of. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) required an introduction, and was careful to
make inquiries concerning every new backer. <div class="bookquote">``In this way,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said to
Ketley, <div class="bookquote">``so long as one is content to bet on a small scale, I think it can
be kept dark; but if you try to extend your connection you're bound to
come across a wrong `un sooner or later. It was that room upstairs that
did for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ketley/Mr. Ketley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never did think much of that room upstairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ketley/Mr. Ketley</b></font>)</div>said Ketley. <div class="bookquote">``There was a
something about it that I didn't like. Be sure you never bet in that jug
and bottle bar, whatever you do. There's just the same look there as in
the room upstairs. Haven't you noticed it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't say I've, nor am I sure that I know exactly what you mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you don't see it, you don't see it; but it's plain enough to me, and
don't you bet with nobody standing in that bar. I wouldn't go in there for
a sovereign.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>William laughed. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) thought at first that Ketley was joking, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) soon
saw that Ketley regarded the jug and bottle entrance with real suspicion.
When pressed to explain, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) told Journeyman that it wasn't that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) was
afraid of the place, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) merely didn't like it. <div class="bookquote">``There's some places that
you likes better than others, ain't they?''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>Journeyman was obliged to
confess that there were.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, that's one of the places I don't like. Don't you hear a voice
talking there, a soft, low voice, with a bit of a jeer in it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>On another occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) shaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) eyes and peered curiously into the
left-hand corner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you looking at?''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>asked Journeyman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At nothing that you can see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ketley/Mr. Ketley</b></font>)</div>Ketley answered; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) whisky as
if lost in consideration of grave and difficult things. A few weeks later
they noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) always got as far from the jug and bottle entrance as
possible, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) was afflicted with a long story concerning a danger that
awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s waiting; but nothing will happen if I don't go in
there. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) can't follow me; he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is waiting for me to go to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then keep out of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>said Journeyman. <div class="bookquote">``You might ask your bloody
friend if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) can tell us anything about the Leger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm trying to keep out of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) way, but he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s always watching and
a-beckoning of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you see him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) now?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Stack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ketley/Mr. Ketley</b></font>)</div>said Ketley; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s a-sitting there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) seems to say that if I
don't come to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) worse will happen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ketley/Mr. Ketley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>William whispered to Journeyman. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
think he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s quite right in `is `ead; he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s been losing a lot lately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div><p/>One day Journeyman was surprised to see Ketley sitting quite composedly in
the jug and bottle bar.

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) got me at last; I had to go, the whispering got so loud in my head as
I was a-coming down the street. I tried to get out into the middle of the
street, but a drunken chap pushed me across the pavement, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was at
the door waiting, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Now, you'd better come in; you know what
will happen if you don't.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk rot, old pal; come round and have a drink with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't just at present--I may later on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do he (<font color='blue'><b>pal</b></font>) mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Stack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord, I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)</div>said Journeyman. <div class="bookquote">``It's only his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) wandering talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the queer man</b></font>)</div><p/>They tried to discuss the chances of the various horses they were
interested in, but they could not detach their thoughts from Ketley, and
their eyes went back to the queer little sallow-faced man who sat on a
high stool in the adjoining bar paring his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nails.

<p/>They felt something was going to happen, and before they could say the
word he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had plunged the knife deep into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck, and had fallen heavily
on the floor. William vaulted over the counter. As he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) did so he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) felt
something break in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) throat, and when Stack and Journeyman came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>)
assistance he (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) was almost as white as the corpse at his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) feet. Blood flowed
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) mouth and from Ketley's neck in a deep stream that swelled into a
great pool and thickened on the sawdust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was jumping over that bar,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>William replied, faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll see to my husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther.

<p/>A rush of blood cut short his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) words, and, leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) walked
feebly round into the back parlour. Esther rang the bell violently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go round at once to Doctor Green,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) isn't in inquire
which is the nearest. Don't come back without a doctor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>William had broken a small blood-vessel, and the doctor said he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would have
to be very careful for a long time. It was likely to prove a long case.
But Ketley had severed the jugular at one swift, keen stroke, and had died
almost instantly. Of course there was an inquest, and the coroner asked
many questions regarding the habits of the deceased. Mrs. Ketley was one
of the witnesses called, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) deposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) had lost a great deal of
money lately in betting, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) went to the <div class="bookquote">``King's Head''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>for the
purpose of betting. The police deposed that the landlord of the <div class="bookquote">``King's
Head''  (<font color='red'><b>The police</b></font>)</div>had been fined a hundred pounds for keeping a betting-house, and the
foreman of the jury remarked that betting-houses were the ruin of the
poorer classes, and that they ought to be put a stop to. The coroner added
that such places as the <div class="bookquote">``King's Head''  (<font color='red'><b>The coroner</b></font>)</div>should not be licensed. That was the
simplest and most effectual way of dealing with the nuisance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There never was no luck about this house,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William, <div class="bookquote">``and what there
was has left us; in three months' time we shall be turned out of it neck
and crop. Another conviction would mean a fine of a couple of hundred, or
most like three months, and that would just about be the end of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They'll never license us again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther, <div class="bookquote">``and the boy at school and
doing so well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry, Esther, to have brought this trouble on you. We must do the
best we can, get the best price we can for the `ouse. I may be lucky
enough to back a few winners. That's all there is to be said--the `ouse
was always an unlucky one. I hate the place, and shall be glad to get out
of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther sighed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) didn't like to hear the house spoken ill of, and after
so many years it did seem a shame.




<p/>XLII


<p/>Esther kept William within doors during the winter months. If his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) health
did not improve it got no worse, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had begun to hope that the
breakage of the blood-vessel did not mean lung disease. But the harsh
winds of spring did not suit him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and there was business with his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) lawyer
to which he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was obliged to attend. A determined set was going to be made
against the renewal of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) licence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was determined to defeat his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
opponents. Counsel was instructed, and a great deal of money was spent on
the case. But the licence was nevertheless refused, and the north-east
wind did not cease to rattle; it seemed resolved on William's death, and
with a sick husband on her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hands, and all the money they had invested in
the house irreparably lost, Esther began to make preparations for moving.

<p/>William had proved a kind husband, and in the seven years she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had spent in
the <div class="bookquote">``King's Head''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>there had been some enjoyment of life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) couldn't say
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had been unhappy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had always disapproved of the betting. They
had tried to do without it. There was a great deal in life which one
couldn't approve of. But Ketley had never been very right in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ketley</b></font>) head, and
Sarah's misfortune had had very little to do with the <div class="bookquote">``King's Head.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Tucker</b></font>)</div>They
had all tried to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) from that man; it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) own fault. There were
worse places than the <div class="bookquote">``King's Head.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It wasn't for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) to abuse it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
had lived there seven years; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) boy growing up--he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was
almost a young man now, and had had the best education. That much good the
<div class="bookquote">``King's Head''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>had done. But perhaps it was no longer suited to William's
health. The betting, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was tired thinking about that; and that constant
nipping, it was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to keep from it with every one asking
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to drink with them. A look of fear and distress passed across her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
face, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) stopped for a moment...

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was rolling up a pair of curtains. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) did not know how they were to
live, that was the worst of it. If they only had back the money they had
sunk in the house she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) would not so much mind. That was what was so hard to
bear; all that money lost, just as if they had thrown it into the river.
Seven years of hard work--for she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had worked hard--and nothing to show
for it. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had been doing the grand lady all the time it would have
been no worse. Horses had won and horses had lost--a great deal of trouble
and fuss and nothing to show for it. That was what stuck in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) throat.
Nothing to show for it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) looked round the dismantled walls, and
descended the vacant staircase. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) would never serve another pint of beer
in that bar. What a strong, big fellow he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) first went to live
with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was sadly changed. Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) ever see him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) strong and well
again? She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) remembered he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was worth nearly #3000. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
hadn't brought him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) luck. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wasn't worth anything like that to-day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much have we in the bank, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A bit over six hundred pounds. I was reckoning of it up yesterday. But
what do you want to know for? To remind me that I've been losing. Well, I
have been losing. I hope you're satisfied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wasn't thinking of such a thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you was, there's no use saying you wasn't. It ain't my fault if the
`orses don't win; I do the best I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) did not answer him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``It's my `ealth that makes me
irritable, dear; you aren't angry, are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear, I know you don't mean it, and I don't pay no attention to it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) spoke so gently that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) surprised, for he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
quick temper, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You're the best wife a man ever had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm not, Bill, but I tries to do my best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The spring was the harshest ever known, and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) cough grew worse and the
blood-spitting returned. Esther grew seriously alarmed. Their doctor spoke
of Brompton Hospital, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) insisted on his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) going there to be examined.
William would not have her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) come with him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not press the point,
fearing to irritate him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), but sat at home waiting anxiously for him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) to
return, hoping against hope, for their doctor had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) feared
very long trouble. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could tell from his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) face and manner that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had
bad news for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). All her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) strength left her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) conquered her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
weakness and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now tell me what they said. I've a right to know; I want to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They said it was consumption.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, did they say that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but they don't mean that I'm going to die. They said they hoped they
could patch me up; people often live for years with only half a lung, and
it is only the left one that's gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) coughed slightly and wiped the blood from his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) lips. Esther was quite
overcome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, don't look like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``or I shall fancy I'm going to die
to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They said they thought that they could patch you up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; they said I might go on a long while yet, but that I would never be
the man I was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This was so obvious she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not check a look of pity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you're going to look at me like that I'd sooner go into the hospital
at once. It ain't the cheerfulest of places, but it will be better than
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry it was consumption. But if they said they could patch you up,
it will be all right. It was a great deal for them to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctors</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) duty was to overcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) grief and speak as if the doctors had told
him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) that there was nothing the matter that a little careful nursing would
fail to put right. William had faith in the warm weather, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) resolved
to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) trust in it. It was hard to see him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) wasting away before her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
eyes and keep cheerful looks in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) face and an accent of cheerfulness in
heir voice. The sunshine which had come at last seemed to suck up all the
life that was in him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) grew paler, and withered like a plant. Then
ill-luck seemed to have joined in the hunt; he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) could not <div class="bookquote">``touch''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>a winner,
and their fortune drained away with his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) life. Favourites and outsiders, it
mattered not; whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) backed lost; and Esther dreaded the cry
<div class="bookquote">``Win-ner, all the win-ner!''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) sat on the little balcony in the sunny
evenings looking down the back street for the boy to appear with the
<div class="bookquote">``special.''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had to go and fetch the paper. On the rare occasions
when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) won, the spectacle was even more painful. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) brightened up, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
thin arm and hand moved nervously, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) began to make projects and
indulge in hopes which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knew were vain.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) insisted, however, on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) taking regularly the medicine they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
at the hospital, and this was difficult to do. For his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) irritability
increased in measure as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) perceived the medicine was doing him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) no good;
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) found fault with the doctors, railed against them unjustly, and all the
while the little; cough continued, and the blood-spitting returned at the
end of cruel intervals, when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had begun to hope that at least that
trouble was done with. One morning he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wife that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was going to
ask the doctors to examine him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) again. They had spoken of patching up; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wanted to know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was going to live or die. There was a certain
relief in hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) speak so plainly; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had had enough of the torture
of hope, and would like to know the worst. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) liked better to go to the
hospital alone, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could not sit at home counting the
minutes for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to return, and begged to be allowed to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). To her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
surprise, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) offered no opposition. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had expected that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) request
would bring about quite a little scene, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had taken it so much as a
matter of course that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was doubly glad
that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had proposed to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hadn't he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might have accused
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) of neglecting him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hat; the day was too hot for a
jacket; it was the beginning of August; the town was deserted, and the
streets looked as if they were about to evaporate or lie down exhausted,
and the poor, dry, dusty air that remained after the season was too poor
even for Esther's healthy lungs; it made William cough, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hoped the
doctors would order him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to the seaside.

<p/>From the top of their omnibus they could see right across the plateau of
the Green Park, dry and colourless like a desert; as they descended the
hill they noticed that autumn was already busy in the foliage; lower down
the dells were full of fallen leaves. At Hyde Park Corner the blown dust
whirled about the hill-top; all along St. George's Place glimpses of the
empty Park appeared through the railings. The wide pavements, the Brompton
Road, and a semi-detached public-house at the cross-roads, announced
suburban London to the Londoner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William, ``where them trees are, where the road turns off
to the left. That `ouse is the ``Bell and Horns.<div class="bookquote">'' That's the sort of house
I should like to see you in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Horns</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a pity we didn't buy it when we had the money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Buy it! That `ouse is worth ten thousand pounds if it's worth a penny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was once in a situation not far from here. I like the Fulham Road; it's
like a long village street, ain't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dunbar</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) first service was with Mrs. Dunbar, in Sydney Street, and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
remembered the square church tower at the Chelsea end; a little further on
there was the Vestry Hall in the King's Road, and then Oakley Street on
the left, leading down to Battersea. Mrs. Dunbar used to go to some
gardens at the end of the King's Road. Cremorne Gardens, that was the
name; there used to be fire-works there, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dunbar</b></font>) often spent the evening
at the back window watching the rockets go up. That was just before Lady
Elwin had got her (<font color='blue'><b>Elwin</b></font>) the situation as kitchen-maid at Woodview. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elwin</b></font>)
remembered the very shops--there was Palmer's the butterman, and there was
Hyde's the grocer's. Everything was just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elwin</b></font>) had left it. How many
years ago? Fifteen or sixteen. So enwrapped was she (<font color='blue'><b>Elwin</b></font>) in memories that
William had to touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Elwin</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Here we are,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``don't you remember the
place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elwin</b></font>) remembered very well that great red brick building, a centrepiece with
two wings, surrounded by high iron railings lined with gloomy shrubs. The
long straight walks, the dismal trees arow, where pale-faced men walked or
rested feebly, had impressed themselves on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elwin</b></font>) young mind--thin, patient
men, pacing their sepulchre. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elwin</b></font>) had wondered who they were, if they would
get well; and then, quick with sensation of lingering death, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elwin</b></font>) had
hurried away on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elwin</b></font>) errands. The low wooden yellow-painted gates were
unchanged. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elwin</b></font>) had never before seen them open, and it was new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elwin</b></font>) to
see the gardens filled with bright sunshine and numerous visitors. There
were flowers in the beds, and the trees were beautiful in their leafage. A
little yellow was creeping through, and from time to time a leaf fell
exhausted from the branches.

<p/>William, who was already familiar with the custom of the place, nodded to
the porter and was let pass without question. He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) did not turn to the
principal entrance in the middle of the building, but went towards a side
entrance. The house physician was standing near it talking with a young
man whom Esther recognised as Mr. Alden. The thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>), too, might
be dying of consumption crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mind, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>) appearance and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>)
healthy, hearty laugh reassured her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). A stout, common girl, healthy too,
came out of the building with a child, a little thing of twelve or
thirteen, with death in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face. Mr. Alden stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>)
cheerful, kind manner hoped the little one was better. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered that
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was. The doctor bade him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) good-bye and beckoned William and Esther to
follow him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). Esther would have liked to have spoken to Mr. Alden. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>)
did not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) husband, who was talking with the
doctor, through the doorway into a long passage. At the end of the passage
there were a number of girls in print dresses. The gaiety of the dresses
led Esther to think that they must be visitors. But the little cough
warned her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) that death was amongst them. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) went past she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) caught sight
of a wasted form in a bath-chair. The thin hands were laid on the knees,
on a little handkerchief, and there were spots on the whiteness deeper
than the colour of the dress. They passed down another passage, meeting a
sister on their way; pretty and discreet she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) black dress and
veil, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) eyes, glancing affectionately at the young
doctor. No doubt they loved each other. The eternal love-story among so
much death!

<p/>Esther wished to be present at the examination, but a sudden whim made
William say that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would prefer to be alone with the doctor, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
returned to the gardens. Mr. Alden had not yet gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>) stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>)
back turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). The little girl she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>) speaking to was
sitting on a bench under the trees; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) held in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hands a skein of
yellow worsted which her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) companion was winding into a ball. Two other
young women were with them and all four were smiling and whispering and
looking towards Mr. Alden. They evidently sought to attract his (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>) attention,
and wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>) to come and speak to them. Just the natural desire of women
to please, and moved by the pathos of this poor coquetting, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>) went to
them, and Esther could see that they all wanted to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) too
would have liked to have spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>) was an old friend. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
walked up the grounds, intending to pass by him (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) walked back. His (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>)
back was still turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and they were all so interested that they
gave no heed to anything else. One of the young women had an exceedingly
pretty face. A small oval, perfectly snow-white, and large blue eyes
shaded with long dark lashes; a little aquiline nose; and Esther heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
say, <div class="bookquote">``I should be well enough if it wasn't for the cough. It isn't no
better since--''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>The cough interrupted the end of the sentence, and
affecting to misunderstand her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), Mr. Alden said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No better than it was a week ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alden</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A week ago!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the poor girl. <div class="bookquote">``It is no better since Christmas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alden</b></font>)</div><p/>There was surprise in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) voice, and the pity of it took Mr. Alden in the
throat, and it was with difficulty that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>) answered that <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hoped that
the present fine weather would enable her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to get well. Such weather as
this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``is as good as going abroad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This assertion was disputed. One of the women had been to Australia for
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) health, and the story of travel was interspersed by the little coughs,
terrible in their apparent insignificance. But it was Mr. Alden that the
others wished to hear speak; they knew all about their companion's trip to
Australia, and in their impatience their eyes went towards Esther. So Mr.
Alden became aware of a new presence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>) turned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! is it you, Esther?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there doesn't seem much the matter with you. You're all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I'm all right, sir; it's my husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked a few yards up the path.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your husband! I'm very sorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s been an out-door patient for some time; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s being examined by the
doctors now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whom did you marry, Esther?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``William Latch, a betting man, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You married a betting man, Esther? How curiously things do work out! I
remember you were engaged to a pious young man, the stationer's foreman.
That was when you were with Miss Rice; you know, I suppose, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>)'s
dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, I didn't know it. I've had so much trouble lately that I've not
been to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) for nearly two years. When did she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) die, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About two months ago. So you married a betting man! Miss Rice did say
something about it, but I don't think I understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a betting
man; I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a publican.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, sir. We lost our licence through the betting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s being examined by the doctor. Is it a bad case?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid it is, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked on in silence until they reached the gate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To me this place is infinitely pathetic. That little cough never silent
for long. Did you hear that poor girl say with surprise that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cough is
no better than it was last Christmas?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. Poor girl, I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s long for this world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But tell me about your husband, Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>) said, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>) face filled
with an expression of true sympathy. <div class="bookquote">``I'm a subscriber, and if your
husband would like to become an in-door patient, I hope you'll let me
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir; you was always the kindest, but there's no reason why I
should trouble you. Some friends of ours have already recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and
it only rests with himself to remain out or go in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>) pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>) watch and said, <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to have met you in such sad
circumstances, but I'm glad to have seen you. It must be seven years or
more since you left Miss Rice. You haven't changed much; you keep your
good looks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>) laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) embarrassment and walked across the road hailing a
hansom, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>) used to in old times when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>) came to see Miss Rice. The
memory of those days came back upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>). It was strange to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>) again
after so many years. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Alden</b></font>) now for the last time. But
it was foolish and wicked, too, to think of such things; her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) husband
dying... But she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) couldn't help it; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) of so much of what was
past and gone. A moment after she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) dashed these personal tears aside and
walked open-hearted to meet William. What had the doctor said? She (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) must
know the truth. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) was to lose him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) would lose everything. No, not
everything; her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) boy would still remain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) felt that, after
all, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) boy was what was most real to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) in life. These thoughts had
passed through her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) mind before William had had time to answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>)
question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said the left lung was gone, that I'd never be able to stand another
winter in England. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said I must go to Egypt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Egypt,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Is that very far from here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What matter how far it is! If I can't live in England I must go where I
can live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be cross, dear. I know it's your health that makes you that
irritable, but it's hard to bear at times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you think that, Bill? Have I ever refused you anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite right, old girl, I'm sorry. I know you'd do anything for me. I've
always said so, haven't I? It's this cough that makes me sharp tempered
and fretful. I shall be different when I get to Egypt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When do we start?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If we get away by the end of October it will be all right. It will cost a
lot of money; the journey is expensive, and we shall have to stop there
six months. I couldn't think of coming home before the end of April.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther did not answer. They walked some yards in silence. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been very unlucky lately; there isn't much over a hundred pounds in
the bank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much shall we want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Three or four hundred pounds at least. We won't take the boy with us, we
couldn't afford that; but I should like to pay a couple of quarters in
advance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That won't be much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if I have any luck. The luck must turn, and I have some splendid
information about the Great Ebor and the Yorkshire Stakes. Stack knows of
a horse or two that's being kept for Sandown. Unfortunately there is not
much doing in August. I must try to make up the money: it's a matter of
life and death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>It was for his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) very life that her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) husband was now gambling on the
race-course, and a sensation of very great wickedness came up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mind,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) stifled it instantly. William had noticed the look of fear that
appeared in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's my last chance. I can't get the money any other way; and I don't
want to die yet awhile. I haven't been as good to you as I'd like, and I
want to do something for the boy, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had been told not to remain out after sundown, but he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was resolved to
leave no stone unturned in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) search for information, and often he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
returned home as late as nine and ten o'clock at night coughing--Esther
could hear him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) all up the street. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) came in ready to drop with fatigue,
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) pockets filled with sporting papers, and these he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) studied, spreading
them on the table under the lamp, while Esther sat striving to do some
needlework. It often dropped out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hands, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes filled with
tears. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) took care that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) should not see these tears; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not
wish to distress him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) unnecessarily. Poor chap! he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had enough to put up
with as it was. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) read out the horses' names and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thought would win, which seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) a likely name. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
begged of him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) not to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>); they had many quarrels on this subject, but
in the end he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) understood that it was not fair to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). Sometimes Stack
and Journeyman came in, and they argued about weights and distances, until
midnight; old John came to see them, and every day he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had heard some new
tip. It often rose to Esther's lips to tell William to back his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) fancy and
have done with it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could see that these discussions only fatigued him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>),
that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was no nearer to the truth now than he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was a fortnight ago.
Meanwhile the horse he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had thought of backing had gone up in the betting.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) must be very careful. They had only a hundred pounds
left; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) must be careful not to risk this money foolishly--it was his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) very
life-blood. If he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) were to lose all this money, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) wouldn't only sign his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
own death warrant, but also hers. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) might linger on a long while--there
was no knowing, but he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would never be able to do any work, that was
certain -LRB-unless he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) went out to Egypt-RRB-; the doctor had said so, and then it
would be she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) who would have to support him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). And if God were merciful
enough to take him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) off at once he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would leave her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) in a worse plight than
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had found her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) in, and the boy growing up! Oh, it was terrible! He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
buried his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands, and seemed quite overcome. Then the cough
would take him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and for a few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could only think of himself.
Esther gave him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a little milk to drink, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a hundred pounds left, Esther. It isn't much, but it's something.
I don't believe that there's much use in my going to Egypt. I shall never
get well. It is better that I should pitch myself into the river. That
would be the least selfish way out of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``William, I will not have you talk in that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther said, laying down
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) work and going over to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``If you was to do such a thing I should
never forgive you. I could never think the same of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, old girl, don't be frightened. I've been thinking too much
about them horses, and am a bit depressed. I daresay it will come out all
right. I think that Mahomet is sure to win the Great Ebor, don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think there's no better judge than yourself. They all say if he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)
don't fall lame that he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)'s bound to win.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then Mahomet shall carry my money. I'll back him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Now that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mind what horse to back his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) spirits revived.
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was able to dismiss the subject from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mind, and they talked of other
things, of their son, and they laid projects for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) welfare. But on the
day of the race, from early morning, William could barely contain himself.
Usually he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) winnings and losings very quietly. When he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had been
especially unlucky he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) swore a bit, but Esther had never seen any great
excitement before a race was run. The issues of this race were
extraordinary, and it was heart-breaking to see him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) suffer; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) could not
remain still a moment. A prey to all the terrors of hope, exhausted with
anticipation, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) rested himself against the sideboard and wiped drops of
sweat from his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) forehead. A broiling sunlight infested their window-panes,
the room grew oven-like, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was obliged at last to go into the back
parlour and lie down. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) lay there in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) shirt sleeves quite exhausted,
hardly able to breathe; the arm once so strong and healthy was shrunken to
a little nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) seemed quite bloodless, and looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) Esther
could hardly hope that any climate would restore him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to health. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) just
asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) what the time was, and said, <div class="bookquote">``The race is being run now.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>A few
minutes after he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I think Mahomet has won. I fancied I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) get
first past the post.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) spoke as if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) were sure, and said nothing about
the evening paper. If he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) were disappointed, Esther felt that it would kill
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knelt down by the bedside and prayed that God would allow the
horse to win. It meant her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) husband's life, that was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knew. Oh, that
the horse might win! Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``There's no use praying, I feel
sure it is all right. Go into the next room, stand on the balcony so that
you may see the boy coming along.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A pale yellow sky rose behind the brick neighbourhood, and with agonised
soul the woman viewed its plausive serenity. There seemed to be hope in
its quietness. At that moment the cry came up, <div class="bookquote">``Win-ner, Win-ner.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It came
from the north, from the east, and now from the west. Three boys were
shouting forth the news simultaneously. Ah, if it should prove bad news!
But somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) too felt that the news was good. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ran to meet the boy.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had a half-penny ready in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fumbled, striving to detach a
single paper from the quire under his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arm. Seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) impatience, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``Mahomet's won.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then the pavement seemed to slide beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet, and
the setting sun she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could hardly see, so full was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart, so burdened
with the happiness that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was bringing to the poor sick fellow who lay
in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) shirt sleeves on the bed in the back room. <div class="bookquote">``It's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``I thought so too; it seemed like it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) face flushed, life seemed
to come back. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) sat up and took the paper from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``I've got my place-money, too. I hope Stack and Journeyman come in
tonight. I'd like to have a chat about this. Come, give me a kiss, dear.
I'm not going to die, after all. It isn't a pleasant thing to think that
you must die, that there's no hope for you, that you must go under
ground.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The next thing to do was to pick the winner of the Yorkshire Handicap. In
this he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was not successful, but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) backed several winners at Sandown Park,
and at the close of the week had made nearly enough to take him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to Egypt.

<p/>The Doncaster week, however, proved disastrous. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) lost most of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
winnings, and had to look forward to retrieving his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) fortunes at Newmarket.
<div class="bookquote">``The worst of it is, if I don't make up the money by October, it will be
no use. They say the November fogs will polish me off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Between Doncaster and Newmarket he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) lost a bet, and this bet carried him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
back into despondency. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) felt it was no use struggling against fate.
Better remain in London and be taken away at the end of November or
December; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) couldn't last much longer than that. This would allow him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to
leave Esther at least fifty pounds to go on with. The boy would soon be
able to earn money. It would be better so. No use wasting all this money
for the sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) health, which wasn't worth two-pence-three-farthings.
It was like throwing sovereigns after farthings. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) didn't want to do any
betting; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was as hollow as a shell inside, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could feel it. Egypt could
do nothing for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had to go, better sooner than later. Esther
argued with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). What should she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) have to live for if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was taken from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). The doctors had said that Egypt might set him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) right. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) didn't know
much about such things, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had always heard that it was extraordinary
how people got cured out there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I've heard that people who couldn't live a week
in England, who haven't the length of your finger of lung left, can go on
all right out there. I might get something to do out there, and the boy
might come out after us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the way I like to hear you talk. Who knows, at Newmarket we might
have luck! Just one big bet, a winner at fifty to one, that's all we
want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just what has been passing in my mind. I've got particular
information about the Cesarewitch and Cambridgeshire. I could get the
price you speak of--fifty to one against the two, Matchbox and
Chasuble--the double event, you know. I'm inclined to go it. It's my last
chance.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Matchbox</b></font>)</div><p/>XLIII


<p/>When Matchbox galloped home the winner of the Cesarewitch by five lengths,
William was lying in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) bed, seemingly at death's door. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had remained
out late one evening, had caught cold, and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mouth was constantly filled
with blood. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was much worse, and could hardly take notice of the good
news. When he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) revived a little he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``It has come too late.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But when
Chasuble was backed to win thousands at ten to one, and Journeyman and
Stack assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) that the stable was quite confident of being able to
pull it off, his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) spirits revived. He (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) spoke of hedging. <div class="bookquote">``If,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) said to
Esther, <div class="bookquote">``I was to get out at eight or nine to one I should be able to
leave you something, you know, in case of accidents.''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) would not
entrust laying off his (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) bet to either Stack of Journeyman; he (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) spoke of a
cab and seeing to it himself. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) did this the doctor assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Journeyman</b></font>) that
it would not much matter whether Chasuble won or lost. <div class="bookquote">``The best thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Matchbox</b></font>)
could do,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>the doctor said, <div class="bookquote">``would be to become an in-door patient at
once. In the hospital he (<font color='blue'><b>Matchbox</b></font>) would be in an equable temperature, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Matchbox</b></font>) would
receive an attention which he (<font color='blue'><b>Matchbox</b></font>) could not get at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>William did not like going into the hospital; it would be a bad omen. If
he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) did, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) felt sure that Chasuble would not win.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What has going or not going to the hospital to do with Chasuble's chance
of winning the Cambridgeshire?''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor. <div class="bookquote">``This window is loose in
its sash, a draught comes under the door, and if you close out the
draughts the atmosphere of the room becomes stuffy. You're thinking of
going abroad; a fortnight's nice rest is just what you want to set you up
for your journey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) allowed himself to be persuaded; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was taken to the hospital, and
Esther remained at home waiting for the fateful afternoon. Now that the
dying man was taken from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had no work to distract her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thought. The
unanswerable question--would Chasuble win?--was always before her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) saw
the slender greyhound creatures as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had seen them at Epsom, through a
sea of heads and hats, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) asked herself if Chasuble was the brown
horse that had galloped in first, or the chestnut that had trotted in
last. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) often thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was going mad--her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) head seemed like it--a
sensation of splitting like a piece of calico... She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) went to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) boy.
Jack was a great tall fellow of fifteen, and had happily lost none of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
affection for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mother, and great sweetness rose up within her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) long, straight, yellow-stockinged legs; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) settled the
collar of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) cloak, and slipped her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fingers into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) leathern belt as
they walked side by side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was bare-headed, according to the fashion of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) school, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) kissed the wild, dark curls with which his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) head was
run over; they were much brighter in colour when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was a little
boy--those days when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) slaved seventeen hours a day for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) dear life!
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) paid her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) back tenfold for the hardship she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had undergone.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) listened to the excellent report his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) masters gave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) progress, and
walked through the quadrangles and the corridors with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), thinking of the
sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) voice as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) classes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
studies. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must live for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>); though for herself she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had had enough of
life. But, thank God, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) darling boy, and whatever unhappiness
there might be in store for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would bear it for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sake. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew
that his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father was ill, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) refrained and told him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) no word of the
tragedy that was hanging over them. The noble instincts which were so
intrinsically Esther Waters' told her (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) that it were a pity to soil at the
outset a young life with a sordid story, and though it would have been an
inexpressible relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) to have shared her (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) trouble with her (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) boy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>)
forced back her (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) tears and courageously bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) cross alone, without once
allowing its edge to touch him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).

<p/>And every day that visitors were allowed she (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) went to the hospital with the
newspaper containing the last betting. <div class="bookquote">``Chasuble, ten to one taken,''
 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>William read out. The mare had advanced three points, and William looked
at Esther inquiringly, and with hope in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Matchbox</b></font>)'ll win,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, raising himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) cane chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) murmured, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) settled his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) cushions.

<p/>Two days after the mare was back again at thirteen to one taken and
offered; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) went back even as far as eighteen to one, and then returned
for a while to twelve to one. This fluctuation meant that something was
wrong, and William began to lose hope. But on the following day the mare
was backed to win a good deal of money at Tattersall's, and once more she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)
stood at ten to one. Seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) back at the old price made William look so
hopeful that a patient stopped as he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) passed down the corridor, and
catching sight of the _Sportsman_ on William's lap, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was
interested in racing. William told him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was, and that if Chasuble
won he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would be able to go to Egypt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Them that has money can buy health as well as everything else. We'd all
get well if we could get out there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>William told him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) how much he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) stood to win.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That'll keep you going long enough to set you straight. You say the
mare's backed at ten to one--two hundred to twenty. I wonder if I could
get the money. I might sell up the `ouse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But before he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had time to realise the necessary money the mare was driven
back to eighteen to one, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) won't win. I might as well leave the wife in the `ouse. There's no
luck for them that comes `ere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>On the day of the race Esther walked through the streets like one daft,
stupidly interested in the passers-by and the disputes that arose between
the drivers of cabs and omnibuses. Now and then her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thoughts collected,
and it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) impossible that the mare should win. If she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) did they
would have #2,500, and would go to Egypt. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) could not imagine such a
thing; it seemed so much more natural that the horse should lose, and that
her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) husband should die, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) should have to face the world once
more. She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) offered up prayers that Chasuble might win, although it did not
seem right to address God on the subject, but her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) heart often felt like
breaking, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) had to do something. And she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) had no doubt that God would
forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>). But now that the day had come she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) did not feel as if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had
granted her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) request. At the same time it did not seem possible that her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)
husband was going to die. It was all so hard to understand.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) stopped at the <div class="bookquote">``Bell and Horns''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>to see what the time was, and was
surprised to find it was half-an-hour later than she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) had expected. The
race was being run, Chasuble's hoofs were deciding whether her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) husband was
to live or die. It was on the wire by this time. The wires were distinct
upon a blue and dove-coloured sky. Did that one go to Newmarket, or the
other? Which?

<p/>The red building came in sight, and a patient walked slowly up the walk,
his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) back turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>); another had sat down to rest. Sixteen years ago
patients were walking there then, and the leaves were scattering then just
as now... Without transition of thought she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) wondered when the first boy
would appear with the news. William was not in the grounds; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was
upstairs behind those windows. Poor fellow, she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) could fancy him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sitting
there. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was watching for her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) out of one of those windows. But
there was no use her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) going up until she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) had the news; she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) must wait for
the paper. She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) walked up and down listening for the cry. Every now and
then expectation led her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) to mistake some ordinary cry for the terrible
<div class="bookquote">``Win-ner, all the win-ner,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>with which the whole town would echo in a few
minutes. She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) hastened forward. No, it was not it. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) heard the
word shrieked behind her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) hastened after the boy, but failed to
overtake him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). Returning, she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) met another, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a half-penny and took a
paper. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) remembered she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) must ask the boy to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) who won. But
heedless of her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) question he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had run across the road to sell papers to some
men who had come out of a public-house. She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) must not give William the
paper and wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to read the news to her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>). If the news were bad the
shock might kill him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) must learn first what the news was, so that her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)
face and manner might prepare him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) for the worst if need be. So she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) offered
the paper to the porter and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Bramble, King of
Trumps, Young Hopeful,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) read out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure that Chasuble hasn't won?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I'm sure, there it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't read,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) said as she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) turned away.

<p/>The news had stunned her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>); the world seemed to lose reality; she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) was
uncertain what to do, and several times repeated to herself, <div class="bookquote">``There's
nothing for it but to go up and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>). I don't see what else I can do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The staircase was very steep; she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) climbed it slowly, and stopped at the
first landing and looked out of the window. A poor hollow-chested
creature, the wreck of a human being, struggled up behind her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) had to
rest several times, and in the hollow building his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) cough sounded loud and
hollow. <div class="bookquote">``It isn't generally so loud as that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) thought, and wondered
how she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) could tell William the news. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) wanted to see Jack grow up to be
a man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) thought that we might all go to Egypt, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'d get quite
well there, for there's plenty of sunshine there, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'ll have to
make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mind to die in the November fogs.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) thoughts came strangely
clear, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) was astonished at her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) indifference, until a sudden
revulsion of feeling took her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) was going up the last flight. She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)
couldn't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) the news; it was too cruel. She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) let the patient pass
her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>), and when alone on the landing she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) looked down into the depth. She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)'d like to fall over; anything rather than to do what she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) knew
she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) must do. But her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) cowardice only endured for a moment, and with a firm
step she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) walked into the corridor. It seemed to cross the entire building,
and was floored and wainscotted with the same brown varnished wood as the
staircase. There were benches along the walls; and emaciated and worn-out
men lay on the long cane chairs in the windowed recesses by which the
passage was lighted. The wards, containing sometimes three, sometimes six
or seven beds, opened on to this passage. The doors of the wards were all
open, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) passed along she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) started at the sight of a boy sitting up
in bed. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head had been shaved and only a slight bristle covered the
crown. The head and face were a large white mass with two eyes. At the end
of the passage there was a window; and William sat there reading a book.
He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and when she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) caught sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)
stopped, holding the paper loose before her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) between finger and thumb, and
as she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) approached she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) manner had already broken the news to
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see that she (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) didn't win,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear, she (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) didn't win. We wasn't lucky this time: next time--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no next time, at least for me. I shall be far away from here
when flat racing begins again. The November fogs will do for me, I feel
that they will. I hope there'll be no lingering, that's all. Better to
know the worst and make up your mind. So I have to go, have I? So there's
no hope, and I shall be under ground before the next meeting. I shall
never lay or take the odds again. It do seem strange. If only that mare
had won. I knew damned well she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) wouldn't if I came here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, catching sight of the pained look on his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) wife's face, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I
don't suppose it made no difference; it was to be, and what has to be has
to be. I've got to go under ground. I felt it was to be all along. Egypt
would have done me no good; I never believed in it--only a lot of false
hope. You don't think what I say is true. Look `ere, do you know what book
this is? This is the Bible; that'll prove to you that I knew the game was
up. I knew, I can't tell you how, but I knew the mare wouldn't win. One
always seems to know. Even when I backed her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) I didn't feel about her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) like
I did about the other one, and ever since I've been feeling more and more
sure that it wasn't to be. Somehow it didn't seem likely, and to-day
something told me that the game was up, so I asked for this book...
There's wonderful beautiful things in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is, indeed, Bill; and I hope you won't get tired of it, but will go
on reading it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's extraordinary how consoling it is. Listen to this. Isn't it
beautiful; ain't them words heavenly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They is, indeed. I knew you'd come to God at last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I've not led a good life. I wouldn't listen to you when you
used to tell me of the lot of harm the betting used to bring on the poor
people what used to come to our place. There's Sarah, I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)'s out
of prison by this. You've seen nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was Ketley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Bill, don't let's think about it. If you're truly sorry, God will
forgive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will--and the others that we know nothing about? I
wouldn't listen to you; I was headstrong, but I understand it all now. My
eyes `ave been opened. Them pious folk that got up the prosecution knew
what they was about. I forgive them one and all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>William coughed a little. The conversation paused, and the cough was
repeated down the corridor. Now it came from the men lying on the long
cane chairs; now from the poor emaciated creature, hollow cheeks, brown
eyes and beard, who had just come out of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) ward and had sat down on a
bench by the wall. Now it came from an old man six feet high, with
snow-white hair. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat near them, and worked assiduously at a piece of
tapestry. <div class="bookquote">``It'll be better when it's cut,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to one of the nurses,
who had stopped to compliment him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work; <div class="bookquote">``it'll be better when it's
cut.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Then the cough came from one of the wards, and Esther thought of the
fearsome boy sitting bolt up, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) huge tallow-like face staring through
the silence of the room. A moment after the cough came from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) husband's
lips, and they looked at each other. Both wanted to speak, and neither
knew what to say. At last William spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was saying that I never had that feeling about Chasuble as one `as
about a winner. Did she (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) run second? Just like my luck if she (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) did. Let me
see the paper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther handed it to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bramble, a fifty to one chance, not a man in a hundred backed her (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>); King
of Trumps, there was some place money lost on him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>); Young Hopeful, a rank
outsider. What a day for the bookies!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mustn't think of them things no more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther. <div class="bookquote">``You've got the
Book; it'll do you more good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I'd only have thought of Bramble... I could have had a hundred to one
against Matchbox and Bramble coupled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the use of thinking of things that's over? We should think of the
future.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I'd only been able to hedge that bet I should have been able to leave
you something to go on with, but now, when everything is paid for, you'll
have hardly a five-pound note. You've been a good wife to me, and I've
been a bad husband to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bill, you mustn't speak like that. You must try to make your peace with
God. Think of Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'ll think of us that you leave behind. I've always
had faith in Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'ll not desert me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes were quite dry; the instinct of life seemed to have left her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).
They spoke some little while longer, until it was time for visitors to
leave the hospital. It was not until she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) got into the Fulham Road that
tears began to run down her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) cheeks; they poured faster and faster, like
rain after long dry weather. The whole world disappeared in a mist of
tears. And so overcome was she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) grief that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had to lean against
the railings, and then the passers-by turned and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) curiously.




<p/>XLIV


<p/>With fair weather he (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) might hold on till Christmas, but if much fog was
about he (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would go off with the last leaves. One day Esther received a
letter asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to defer her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) visit from Friday to Sunday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hoped to be
better on Sunday, and then they would arrange when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) should come to take
him (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) begged of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to have Jack home to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wanted to see
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) boy before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) died.

<p/>Mrs. Collins, a woman who lived in the next room, read the letter to
Esther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you can, do as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wishes. Once they gets them fancies into their heads
there's no getting them out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) leaves the hospital on a day like this it'll be the death of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Both women</b></font>)</div><p/>Both women went to the window. The fog was so thick that only an outline
here and there was visible of the houses opposite. The lamps burnt low,
mournful, as in a city of the dead, and the sounds that rose out of the
street added to the terror of the strange darkness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) say about Jack? That I'm to send for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). It's natural he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
should like to see the boy before he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) goes, but it would be cheerfuller to
take him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to the hospital.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wants to die at home; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wants you to be with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) at the
last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I want to see the last of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). But the boy, where's he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to sleep?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We can lay a mattress down in my room--an old woman like me, it don't
matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Sunday morning was harsh and cold, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) came out of South
Kensington Station a fog was rising in the squares, and a great whiff of
yellow cloud drifted down upon the house-tops. In the Fulham road the tops
of the houses disappeared, and the light of the third gas-lamp was not
visible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the sort of weather that takes them off. I can hardly breathe it
myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Everything was shadow-like; those walking in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) passed out of
sight like shades, and once she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) must have missed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) way,
though that was impossible, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) way was quite straight... Suddenly
the silhouette of the winged building rose up enormous on the sulphur sky.
The low-lying gardens were full of poisonous vapour, and the thin trees
seemed like the ghosts of consumptive men. The porter coughed like a dead
man as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) passed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Bad weather for the poor sick ones
upstairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was prepared for a change for the worse, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not expect to see
a living man looking so like a dead one.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could no longer lie back in bed and breathe, so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was propped up with
pillows, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked even as shadow-like as those she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had half seen in
the fog-cloud. There was fog even in the ward, and the lights burned red
in the silence. There were five beds--low iron bedsteads--and each was
covered with a dark red rug. In the furthest corner lay the wreck of a
great working man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hob-nails and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) corduroys, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) once
brawny arm lay along his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thigh, shrivelled and powerless as a child's. In
the middle of the room a little clerk, wasted and weary, without any
strength at all, lay striving for breath. The navvy was alone; the little
clerk had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family round him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) two children, a baby in
arms and a little boy three years old. The doctor had just come in, and
the woman was prattling gaily about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) confinement. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was up the following week. Wonderful what we women can go through. No
one would think it... brought the childer to see their father; they is a
little idol to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), poor fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you to-day, dearie?''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) took a seat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
husband's bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better than I was on Friday, but this weather'll do for me if it
continues much longer... You see them two beds? They died yesterday, and
I've `eard that three or four that left the hospital are gone, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The doctor came to William's bed. <div class="bookquote">``Well, are you still determined to go
home?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I'd like to die at home. You can't do nothing for me... I'd like to
die at home; I want to see my boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can see Jack here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd sooner see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) at `ome... I suppose you don't want the trouble of a
death in the `ouse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, William, how can you speak so!''  (<font color='red'><b>The patient</b></font>)</div>The patient coughed painfully, and
leaned against the pillows, unable to speak.

<p/>Esther remained with William till the time permitted to visitors had
expired. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) could not speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to be with
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) came on Thursday to take him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) away, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was a little better. The
clerk's wife was chattering; the great navvy lay in the corner, still as a
block of stone. Esther often looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) and wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had no
friend who could spare an hour to come and see him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was beginning to think that you wasn't coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div>said William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)'s that restless,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>said the clerk's wife; <div class="bookquote">``asking the time every three
or four minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>clerk wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How could you think that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dun know... you're a bit late, aren't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It often do make them that restless,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>said the clerk's wife. <div class="bookquote">``But my poor
old man is quiet enough--aren't you, dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>The clerk</b></font>)</div>The dying clerk could not
answer, and the woman turned again to Esther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how do you find him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to-day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much the same... I think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a bit better; stronger, don't yer know.
But this weather is that trying. I don't know how it was up your way, but
down my way I never seed such a fog. I thought I'd have to turn back.''  (<font color='red'><b>the baby</b></font>)</div>At
that moment the baby began to cry, and the woman walked up and down the
ward, rocking it violently, talking loud, and making a great deal of
noise. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not quiet him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)... <div class="bookquote">``Hungry again,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I never
seed such a child for the breast,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat down and unbuttoned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
dress. When the young doctor entered she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hurriedly covered herself; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
begged her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to continue, and spoke about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) little boy. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) showed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a
scar on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) throat. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been suffering, but it was all right now. The
doctor glanced at the breathless father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A little better to-day, thank you, doctor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all right;''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>and the doctor went over to William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you still determined to leave the hospital?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I want to go home. I want to--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll find this weather very trying; you'd better--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you, sir. I should like to go home. You've been very kind;
you've done everything that could be done for me. But it's God's will...
My wife is very grateful to you, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed, I am, sir. However am I to thank you for your kindness to my
husband?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry I couldn't do more. But you'll want the sister to help you to
dress him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). I'll send her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>When they got him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) out of bed, Esther was shocked at the spectacle of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
poor body. There was nothing left of him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) poor chest, his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) wasted ribs,
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) legs gone to nothing, and the strange weakness, worst of all, which
made it so hard for them to dress him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). At last it was nearly done: Esther
laced one boot, the nurse the other, and, leaning on Esther's arm, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
looked round the room for the last time. The navvy turned round on his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) bed
and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, mate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The navvy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye... Good-bye, all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The clerk</b></font>)</div><p/>The clerk's little son clung to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother's skirt, frightened at the
weakness of so big a man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and say good-bye to the gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The little boy came forward timidly, offering his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand. William looked at
the poor little white face; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) nodded to the father and went out.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) went downstairs he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would like to go home in a hansom. The
doctor and nurse expostulated, but he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) persisted until Esther begged of him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
to forego the wish for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They do rattle so, these four-wheelers, especially when the windows are
up. One can't speak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>The cab jogged up Piccadilly, and as it climbed out of the hollow the
dying man's eyes were fixed on the circle of lights that shone across the
Green Park. They looked like a distant village, and Esther wondered if
William was thinking of Shoreham--she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had seen Shoreham look like that
sometimes--or if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was looking on London for the
last time. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) saying to himself, <div class="bookquote">``I shall never, never see Piccadilly
again'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>? They passed St. James's Street. The Circus, with its mob of
prostitutes, came into view; the <div class="bookquote">``Criterion''  (<font color='red'><b>prostitutes</b></font>)</div>bar, with its loafers
standing outside. William leaned a little forward, and Esther was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
was thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would never go into that bar again. The cab turned to
the left, and Esther said that it would cross Soho, perhaps pass down Old
Compton Street, opposite their old house. It happened that it did, and
Esther and William wondered who were the new people who were selling beer
and whisky in the bar? All the while boys were crying, <div class="bookquote">``Win-ner, all the
win-ner!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the while boys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The -- was run to-day. Flat racing all over, all over for this year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther did not answer. The cab passed over a piece of asphalte, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Jack waiting for us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) came home yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The fog was thick in Bloomsbury, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) got out of the cab he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was
taken with a fit of coughing, and had to cling to the railings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had to
pay the cab, and it took some time to find the money. Would no one open
the door? She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was surprised to see him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) make his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) way up the steps to the
bell, and having got her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) change, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) into the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can manage. Go on first; I'll follow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And stopping every three or four steps for rest, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) slowly dragged himself
up to the first landing. A door opened and Jack stood on the threshold of
the lighted room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that you, mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear; your father is coming up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy came forward to help, but his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother whispered, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d rather come
up by himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>William had just strength to walk into the room; they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) a chair,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) fell back exhausted. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) looked around, and seemed pleased to see
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) home again. Esther gave him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) some milk, into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had put a little
brandy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) gradually revived.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come this way, Jack; I want to look at you; come into the light where I
can see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't long to see you, Jack. I wanted to be with you and your mother
in our own home. I can talk a little now: I may not be able to to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want you to promise me, Jack, that you'll never have nothing to do with
racing and betting. It hasn't brought me or your mother any luck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You promise me, Jack. Give me your hand. You promise me that, Jack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father, I promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see it all clearly enough now. Your mother, Jack, is the best woman in
the world. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) loved you better than I did. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) worked for you--that is a
sad story. I hope you'll never hear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Husband wife</b></font>)</div><p/>Husband and wife looked at each other, and in that look the wife promised
the husband that the son should never know the story of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) desertion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was always against the betting, Jack; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) always knew it would bring
us ill-luck. I was once well off, but I lost everything. No good comes of
money that one doesn't work for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you worked enough for what you won,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther; <div class="bookquote">``travelling
day and night from race-course to race-course. Standing on them
race-courses in all weathers; it was the colds you caught standing on them
race-courses that began the mischief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I worked hard enough, that's true; but it was not the right kind of
work... I can't argue, Esther... But I know the truth now, what you
always said was the truth. No good comes of money that hasn't been
properly earned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sipped the brandy-and-milk and looked at Jack, who was crying bitterly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mustn't cry like that, Jack; I want you to listen to me. I've still
something on my mind. Your mother, Jack, is the best woman that ever
lived. You're too young to understand how good. I didn't know how good for
a long time, but I found it all out in time, as you will later, Jack, when
you are a man. I'd hoped to see you grow up to be a man, Jack, and your
mother and I thought that you'd have a nice bit of money. But the money I
hoped to leave you is all gone. What I feel most is that I'm leaving you
and your mother as badly off as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was when I married her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) heaved a
deep sigh, and Esther said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the good of talking of these things, weakening yourself for
nothing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must speak, Esther. I should die happy if I knew how you and the boy
was going to live. You'll have to go out and work for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as you did
before. It will be like beginning it all again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The tears rolled down his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) cheeks; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hands and
sobbed, until the sobbing brought on a fit of coughing. Suddenly his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mouth
filled with blood. Jack went for the doctor, and all remedies were tried
without avail. <div class="bookquote">``There is one more remedy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>the doctor said, <div class="bookquote">``and if that
fails you must prepare for the worst.''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>But this last remedy proved
successful, and the hæmorrhage was stopped, and William was undressed and
put to bed. The doctor said, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mustn't get up to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You lie in bed to-morrow, and try to get up your strength. You've
overdone yourself to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) bed into the warmest corner, close by the fire, and had
made up for herself a sort of bed by the window, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) might doze a
bit, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not expect to get much sleep. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would have to be up and
down many times to settle his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) pillows and give him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) milk or a little weak
brandy-and-water.

<p/>Night wore away, the morning grew into day, and about twelve o'clock he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
insisted on getting up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) tried to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) could
not stop in bed; and there was nothing for it but to ask Mrs. Collins to
help her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) dress him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). They placed him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) comfortably in a chair. The cough had
entirely ceased and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) seemed better. And on Saturday night he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) slept
better than he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had done for a long while and woke up on Sunday morning
refreshed and apparently much stronger. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had a nice bit of boiled rabbit
for his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) dinner. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) didn't speak much; Esther fancied that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was still
thinking of them. When the afternoon waned, about four o'clock, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) called
Jack; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) to sit in the light where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) son with such wistful eyes. These farewells were very sad,
and Esther had to turn aside to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have liked to have seen you a man, Jack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't speak like that--I can't bear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the poor boy, bursting into
tears. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you won't die yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Jack; I'm wore out. I can feel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, pointing to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) chest,
<div class="bookquote">``that there is nothing here to live upon... It is the punishment come
upon me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Punishment for what, father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wasn't always good to your mother, Jack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If to please me, William, you'll say no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The boy ought to know; it will be a lesson for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and it weighs upon my
heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want my boy to hear anything bad about his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father, and I forbid
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to listen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Latch</b></font>)</div><p/>The conversation paused, and soon after William said that his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) strength was
going from him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would like to go back to bed. Esther helped
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) off with his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) clothes, and together she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) and Jack lifted him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) into bed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) sat up looking at them with wistful, dying eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is hard to part from you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``If Chasuble had won we would have
all gone to Egypt. I could have lived out there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must speak of them things no more. We all must obey God's will.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>Esther dropped on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knees; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) drew Jack down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and William
asked Jack to read something from the Bible. Jack read where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) first
opened the book, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had finished William said that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) liked to
listen. Jack's voice sounded to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) like heaven.

<p/>About eight o'clock William bade his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) son good-night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, my boy; perhaps we shan't see each other again. This may be
my last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't leave you, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my boy, go to your bed. I feel I'd like to be alone with mother.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The
voice sank almost to a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll remember what you promised me about racing... Be good to your
mother--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s the best mother a son ever had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll work for mother, father, I'll work for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're too young, my son, but when you're older I hope you'll work for
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) worked for you... Good-bye, my boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The dying man sweated profusely, and Esther wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face from time to
time. Mrs. Collins came in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had a large tin candlestick in her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) hand in
which there was a fragment of candle end. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) motioned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) to put it
aside. She (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) put it on the table out of the way of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll help Esther to lay me out... I don't want any one else. I don't
like the other woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Esther and me will lay you out, make your mind easy; none but we two
shall touch you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/>Once more Esther wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) signed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wished
the bed-clothes to be arranged, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could no longer speak. Mrs. Collins
whispered to Esther that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not think that the end could be far off,
and compelled by a morbid sort of curiosity she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) took a chair and sat down.
Esther wiped away the little drops of sweat as they came upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
forehead; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chest and throat had to be wiped also, for they too were
full of sweat. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes were fixed on the darkness and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moved his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand
restlessly, and Esther always understood what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a
little brandy-and-water, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not take it from the glass she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
gave it to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with a spoon.

<p/>The silence grew more solemn, and the clock on the mantelpiece striking
ten sharp strokes did not interrupt it; and then, as Esther turned from
the bedside for the brandy, Mrs. Collins's candle spluttered and went out;
a little thread of smoke evaporated, leaving only a morsel of blackened
wick; the flame had disappeared for ever, gone as if it had never been,
and Esther saw darkness where there had been a light. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heard Mrs.
Collins say--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it is all over, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Collins</b></font>)</div><p/>The profile on the pillow seemed very little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold up his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head, so that if there is any breath it may come on the
glass.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s dead, right enough. You see, dear, there's not a trace of breath on
the glass.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd like to say a prayer. Will you say a prayer with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I feel as if I should like to myself; it eases the heart wonderful.''




 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>XLV


<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) stood on the platform watching the receding train. A few bushes hid
the curve of the line; the white vapour rose above them, evaporating in
the grey evening. A moment more and the last carriage would pass out of
sight. The white gates swung slowly forward and closed over the line.

<p/>An oblong box painted reddish brown lay on the seat beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>). A woman of
seven or eight and thirty, stout and strongly built, short arms and
hard-worked hands, dressed in dingy black skirt and a threadbare jacket
too thin for the dampness of a November day. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) face was a blunt outline,
and the grey eyes reflected all the natural prose of the Saxon.

<p/>The porter told her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) would try to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) box up to Woodview
to-morrow... That was the way to Woodview, right up the lane. She (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) could
not miss it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) would find the lodge gate behind that clump of trees. And
thinking how she (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) could get her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) box to Woodview that evening, she (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) looked at
the barren strip of country lying between the downs and the shingle beach.
The little town clamped about its deserted harbour seemed more than ever
like falling to pieces like a derelict vessel, and when Esther passed over
the level crossing she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) noticed that the line of little villas had not
increased; they were as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had left them eighteen years ago, laurels,
iron railing, antimacassars. It was about eighteen years ago, on a
beautiful June day, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had passed up this lane for the first time.
At the very spot she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was now passing she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had stopped to wonder if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
would be able to keep the place of kitchen-maid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) remembered regretting
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had not a new dress; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had hoped to be able to brighten up the
best of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) cotton prints with a bit of red ribbon. The sun was shining,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had met William leaning over the paling in the avenue smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
pipe. Eighteen years had gone by, eighteen years of labour, suffering,
disappointment. A great deal had happened, so much that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not
remember it all. The situations she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had been in; her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) life with that dear
good soul, Miss Rice, then Fred Parsons, then William again; her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) marriage,
the life in the public-house, money lost and money won, heart-breakings,
death, everything that could happen had happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>). Now it all seemed
like a dream. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) boy remained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) had brought up her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) boy,
thank God, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) had been able to do that. But how had she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) done it? How
often had she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) found herself within sight of the workhouse? The last time
was no later than last week. Last week it had seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) would
have to accept the workhouse. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) had escaped, and now here she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) was
back at the very point from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) started, going back to Woodview,
going back to Mrs. Barfield's service.

<p/>William's illness and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) funeral had taken Esther's last few pounds away
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) and Jack came back from the cemetery she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) found that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had broken into her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) last sovereign. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) clasped him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) bosom--he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
was a tall boy of fifteen--and burst into tears. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was crying for. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not say, <div class="bookquote">``God only knows how we shall
find bread to eat next week;''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) merely said, wiping away her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) tears, <div class="bookquote">``We
can't afford to live here any longer. It's too expensive for us now that
father's gone.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And they went to live in a slum for three-and-sixpence a
week. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had been alone in the world she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would have gone into a
situation, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not leave the boy, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had to look out for
charing. It was hard to have to come down to this, particularly when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had had a house and a servant of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) own; but there
was nothing for it but to look out for some charing, and get along as best
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could until Jack was able to look after himself. But the various
scrubbings and general cleaning that had come her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) way had been so badly
paid that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) soon found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could not make both ends meet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would
have to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) boy and go out as a general servant. And as her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
necessities were pressing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) accepted a situation in a coffee-shop in
the London Road. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would give all her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wages to Jack, seven shillings a
week, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) would have to live on that. So long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) health she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
did not mind.

<p/>It was a squat brick building with four windows that looked down on the
pavement with a short-sighted stare. On each window was written in letters
of white enamel, <div class="bookquote">``Well-aired beds.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A board nailed to a post by the
side-door announced that tea and coffee were always ready. On the other
side of the sign was an upholsterer's, and the vulgar brightness of the
Brussels carpets seemed in keeping with the slop-like appearance of the
coffeehouse.

<p/>Sometimes a workman came in the morning; a couple more might come in about
dinner-time. Sometimes they took rashers and bits of steak out of their
pockets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't you cook this for me, missis?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the straggler</b></font>)</div><p/>But it was not until about nine in the evening that the real business of
the house began, and it continued till one, when the last straggler
knocked for admittance. The house lived on its beds. The best rooms were
sometimes let for eight shillings a night, and there were four beds which
were let at fourpence a night in the cellar under the area where Esther
stood by the great copper washing sheets, blankets, and counterpanes, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was not cleaning the rooms upstairs. There was a double-bedded room
underneath the kitchen, and over the landings, wherever a space could be
found, the landlord, who was clever at carpentering work, had fitted up
some sort of closet place that could be let as a bedroom. The house was a
honeycomb. The landlord slept under the roof, and a corner had been found
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) housekeeper, a handsome young woman, at the end of the passage.
Esther and the children--the landlord was a widower--slept in the
coffee-room upon planks laid across the tops of the high backs of the
benches where the customers mealed. Mattresses and bedding were laid on
these planks and the sleepers lay, their faces hardly two feet from the
ceiling. Esther slept with the baby, a little boy of five; the two big
boys slept at the other end of the room by the front door. The eldest was
about fifteen, but he (<font color='blue'><b>eldest</b></font>) was only half-witted; and he (<font color='blue'><b>eldest</b></font>) helped in the
housework, and could turn down the beds and see quicker than any one if
the occupant had stolen sheet or blanket. Esther always remembered how he (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>)
would raise himself up in bed in the early morning, rub the glass, and
light a candle so that he (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>) could be seen from below. He (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>) head if
every bed was occupied, or signed with his (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>) fingers the prices of the beds
if they had any to let.

<p/>The landlord was a tall, thin man, with long features and hair turning
grey. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very quiet, and Esther was surprised one night at the
abruptness with which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopped a couple who were going upstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that your wife?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s my wife all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) don't look very old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s older than she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) looks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, half to Esther, half to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) housekeeper, that it was hard to
know what to do. If you asked them for their marriage certificates they'd
be sure to show you something. The housekeeper answered that they paid
well, and that was the principal thing. But when an attempt was made to
steal the bedclothes the landlord and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) housekeeper were more severe. As
Esther was about to let a most respectable woman out of the front door,
the idiot boy called down the stairs, <div class="bookquote">``Stop her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)! There's a sheet missing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the idiot boy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what in the world is all this? I haven't got your sheet. Pray let me
pass; I'm in a hurry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't let you pass until the sheet is found.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll find it upstairs under the bed. It's got mislaid. I'm in a hurry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Call in the police,''  (<font color='red'><b>idiot</b></font>)</div>shouted the idiot boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better come upstairs and help me to find the sheet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther.

<p/>The woman hesitated a moment, and then walked up in front of Esther. When
they were in the bedroom she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) shook out her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) petticoats, and the sheet fell
on the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther, <div class="bookquote">``a nice botheration you'd 've got me into. I
should've had to pay for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I could pay for it; it was only because I'm not very well off at
present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you _will_ pay for it if you don't take care,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>said Esther.

<p/>It was very soon after that Esther had her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mother's books stolen from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).
They had not been doing much business, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had been put to sleep in
one of the bedrooms. The room was suddenly wanted, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had no time to
move all her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) things, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) went to make up the room she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) found that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mother's books and a pair of jet earrings that Fred had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had
been stolen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could do nothing; the couple who had occupied the room
were far away by this time. There was no hope of ever recovering her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) books
and earrings, and the loss of these things caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) a great deal of
unhappiness. The only little treasure she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) possessed were those earrings;
now they were gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) realised how utterly alone she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was in the world.
If her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) health were to break down to-morrow she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would have to go to the
workhouse. What would become of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) boy? She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was afraid to think; thinking
did no good. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) must not think, but must just work on, washing the
bedclothes until she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could wash no longer. Wash, wash, all the week long;
and it was only by working on till one o'clock in the morning that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
sometimes managed to get the Sabbath free from washing. Never, not even in
the house in Chelsea, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had such hard work, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was not as
strong now as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was then. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) courage did not give way until one
Sunday Jack came to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) that the people who employed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had sold
their business.

<p/>Then a strange weakness came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thought of the endless week of
work that awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) in the cellar, the great copper on the fire, the
heaps of soiled linen in the corner, the steam rising from the wash-tub,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had not sufficient strength to get through another week
of such work. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) son with despair in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had
whispered to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) lay asleep under her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) shawl, a tiny infant, <div class="bookquote">``There
is nothing for us, my poor boy, but the workhouse,''  (<font color='red'><b>a infant boy</b></font>)</div>and the same thought
rose up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mind as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), a tall lad with large grey eyes
and dark curling hair. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) despair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
merely said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know how we shall pull through, Jack. God will help us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're washing too hard, mother. You're wasting away. Do you know no one,
mother, who could help us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looked at Jack fixedly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thought of Mrs. Barfield. Mrs.
Barfield might be away in the South with her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) daughter. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) were at
Woodview Esther felt sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) would not refuse to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>). So Jack
wrote at Esther's dictation, and before they expected an answer, a letter
came from Mrs. Barfield saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) remembered Esther perfectly well.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) had just returned from the South. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) was all alone at Woodview, and
wanted a servant. Esther could come and take the place if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) liked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
enclosed five pounds, and hoped that the money would enable Esther to
leave London at once.

<p/>But this returning to former conditions filled Esther with strange
trouble. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heart beat as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) recognised the spire of the church between
the trees, and the undulating line of downs behind the trees awakened
painful recollections. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knew the white gate was somewhere in this
plantation, but could not remember its exact position; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) took the
road to the left instead of taking the road to the right, and had to
retrace her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) steps. The gate had fallen from its hinge, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had some
difficulty in opening it. The lodge where the blind gatekeeper used to
play the flute was closed; the park paling had not been kept in repair;
wandering sheep and cattle had worn away the great holly hedge; and Esther
noticed that in falling an elm had broken through the garden wall.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) arrived at the iron gate under the bunched evergreens, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) steps
paused. For this was where she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had met William for the first time. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had
taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) through the stables and pointed out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) Silver Braid's box.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) remembered the horses going to the downs, horses coming from the
downs--stabling and the sound of hoofs everywhere. But now silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
could see that many a roof had fallen, and that ruins of outhouses filled
the yard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) remembered the kitchen windows, bright in the setting sun,
and the white-capped servants moving about the great white table. But now
the shutters were up, nowhere a light; the knocker had disappeared from
the door, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) asked herself how she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was to get in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) even felt
afraid... Supposing she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) should not find Mrs. Barfield. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) way
through the shrubbery, tripping over fallen branches and trunks of trees;
rooks rose out of the evergreens with a great clatter, her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) heart stood
still, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) hardly dared to tear herself through the mass of underwood.
At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) gained the lawn, and, still very frightened, sought for the
bell. The socket plate hung loose on the wire, and only a faint tinkle
came through the solitude of the empty house.

<p/>At last footsteps and a light; the chained door was opened a little, and a
voice asked who it was. Esther explained; the door was opened, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
stood face to face with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) old mistress. Mrs. Barfield stood, holding the
candle high, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) could see Esther. Esther knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) at once. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
had not changed very much. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) beautiful white teeth and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
girlish smile; the pointed, vixen-like face had not altered in outline,
but the reddish hair was so thin that it had to be parted on the side and
drawn over the skull; her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) figure was delicate and sprightly as ever.
Esther noticed all this, and Mrs. Barfield noticed that Esther had grown
stouter. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) face was still pleasant to see, for it kept that look of
blunt, honest nature which had always been its charm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was now the
thick-set working woman of forty, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) stood holding the hem of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
jacket in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) rough hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'd better put the chain up, for I'm alone in the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't you afraid, ma'am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little, but there's nothing to steal. I asked the policeman to keep a
look-out. Come into the library.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the parrot</b></font>)</div><p/>There was the round table, the little green sofa, the piano, the parrot's
cage, and the yellow-painted presses; and it seemed only a little while
since she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had been summoned to this room, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had stood facing her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
mistress, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) confession on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) lips. It seemed like yesterday, and yet
seventeen years and more had gone by. And all these years were now a sort
of a blur in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mind--a dream, the connecting links of which were gone,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) stood face to face with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) old mistress in the old room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've had a cold journey, Esther; you'd like some tea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't trouble, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no trouble; I should like some myself. The fire's out in the
kitchen. We can boil the kettle here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They went through the baize door into the long passage. Mrs. Barfield told
Esther where was the pantry, the kitchen, and the larder. Esther answered
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) remembered quite well, and it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) not a little strange
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) should know these things. Mrs. Barfield said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you haven't forgotten Woodview, Esther?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barfield/Barfield</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, ma'am. It seems like yesterday... But I'm afraid the damp has got
into the kitchen, ma'am, the range is that neglected--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barfield/Barfield</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Woodview isn't what it was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barfield/Barfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Barfield told how she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) had buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) husband in the old village
church. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) daughter to Egypt; she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) had dwindled there till
there was little more than a skeleton to lay in the grave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am, I know how it takes them, inch by inch. My husband died of
consumption.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They sat talking for hours. One thing led to another and Esther gradually
told Mrs. Barfield the story of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) life from the day they bade each other
good-bye in the room they were now sitting in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is quite a romance, Esther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a hard fight, and it isn't over yet, ma'am. It won't be over until
I see him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) settled in some regular work. I hope I shall live to see him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
settled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They sat over the fire a long time without speaking. Mrs. Barfield said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be getting on for bedtime.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barfield/Barfield</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it must, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) asked if she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) should sleep in the room she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) had once shared with
Margaret Gale. Mrs. Barfield answered with a sigh that as all the bedrooms
were empty Esther had better sleep in the room next to hers.




<p/>XLVI


<p/>Esther seemed to have quite naturally accepted Woodview as a final stage.
Any further change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) life she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not seem to regard as possible or
desirable. One of these days her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) boy would get settled; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would come down
now and again to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not want any more than that. No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did
not find the place lonely. A young girl might, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was no longer a
young girl; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) work to do, and when it was done she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was glad to
sit down to rest.

<p/>And, dressed in long cloaks, the women went for walks together; sometimes
they went up the hill, sometimes into Southwick to make some little
purchases. On Sundays they walked to Beeding to attend meeting. And they
came home along the winter roads, the peace and happiness of prayer upon
their faces, holding their skirts out of the mud, unashamed of their
common boots. They made no acquaintances, seeming to find in each other
all necessary companionship. Their heads bent a little forward, they
trudged home, talking of what they were in the habit of talking, that
another tree had been blown down, that Jack was now earning good
money--ten shillings a week. Esther hoped it would last. Or else Esther
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mistress that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had heard that one of Mr. Arthur's horses had
won a race. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) lived in the North of England, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had a small
training stable, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mother never heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) except through the
sporting papers. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hasn't been here for four years,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barfield/Barfield</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Barfield said;
<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hates the place; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wouldn't care if I were to burn it down
to-morrow... However, I do the best I can, hoping that one day he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'ll
marry and come and live here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barfield/Barfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Arthur--that was how Mrs. Barfield and Esther spoke of him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)--did not
draw any income from the estate. The rents only sufficed to pay the
charges and the widow's jointure. All the land was let; the house he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had
tried to let, but it had been found impossible to find a tenant, unless
Mr. Arthur would expend some considerable sum in putting the house and
grounds into a state of proper repair. This he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) did not care to do; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) found race-horses a more profitable speculation. Besides, even the
park had been let on lease; nothing remained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) but the house and lawn
and garden; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could no longer gallop a horse on the hill without
somebody's leave, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) didn't care what became of the place. His (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mother
might go on living there, keeping things together as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) called it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) did
not mind what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) didn't bother him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). So did he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) express
himself regarding Woodview on the rare occasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) visits, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
troubled to answer his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mother's letters. Mrs. Barfield, whose thoughts
were limited to the estate, was pained by his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) indifference; she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) gradually
ceased to consult him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and when Beeding was too far for her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) to walk she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>)
had the furniture removed from the drawing-room and a long deal table
placed there instead. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) had not asked herself if Arthur would object to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) inviting a few brethren of the neighbourhood to her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) house for meeting,
or publishing the meetings by notices posted on the lodge gate.

<p/>One day Mrs. Barfield and Esther were walking in the avenue, when, to
their surprise, they saw Mr. Arthur open the white gate and come through.
The mother hastened forward to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son, but paused, dismayed by the
anger that looked out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) did not like the notices, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
was sorry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was annoyed. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) didn't think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would mind them,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hastened by his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) side, pleading her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) excuses. But to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) great
sorrow Arthur did not seem to be able to overcome his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) annoyance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
refused to listen, and continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) reproaches, saying the things that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
knew would most pain her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) did not care whether the trees stood or fell, whether the cement
remained upon the walls or dropped from them; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) didn't draw a penny of
income from the place, and did not care a damn what became of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to live there, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) got her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) jointure out of the property, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) didn't want to interfere with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), but what he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could not stand was the
snuffy little folk from the town coming round his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) house. The Barfields at
least were county, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) wished Woodview to remain county as long as the
walls held together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) wasn't a bit ashamed of all this ruin. You could
receive the Prince of Wales in a ruin, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wouldn't care to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
into a dissenting chapel. Mrs. Barfield answered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) didn't see how
the mere assembling of a few friends in prayer could disgrace a house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>)
did not know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) objected to her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) asking them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) would not ask them
any more. The only thing was that there was no place nearer than Beeding
where they could meet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) could no longer walk so far. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) would have
to give up meeting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me a strange taste to want to kneel down with a lot of little
shop-keepers... Is this where you kneel?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) said, pointing to the long
deal table. <div class="bookquote">``The place is a regular little Bethel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our Lord said that when a number should gather together for prayer that
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) would be among them. Those are true words, and as we get old we feel
more and more the want of this communion of spirit. It is only then that
we feel that we're really with God... The folk that you despise are equal
in His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sight. And living here alone, what should I be without prayer? and
Esther, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) life of trouble and strife, what would she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) be without
prayer?... It is our consolation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think one should choose one's company for prayer as for everything
else. Besides, what do you get out of it? Miracles don't happen nowadays.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're very young, Arthur, and you cannot feel the want of prayer as we
do--two old women living in this lonely house. As age and solitude
overtake us, the realities of life float away and we become more and more
sensible to the mystery which surrounds us. And our Lord Jesus Christ gave
us love and prayer so that we might see a little further.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>An expression of great beauty came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) face, that unconscious
resignation which, like the twilight, hallows and transforms. In such
moments the humblest hearts are at one with nature, and speaks out of the
eternal wisdom of things. So even this common racing man was touched, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry if I said anything to hurt your religious feelings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Barfield did not answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you not accept my apologies, mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear boy, what do I care for your apologies; what are they to me? All
I think of now is your conversion to Christ. Nothing else matters. I shall
always pray for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may have whom you like up here; I don't mind if it makes you happy.
I'm ashamed of myself. Don't let's say any more about it. I'm only down
for the day. I'm going home to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Home, Arthur! this is your home. I can't bear to hear you speak of any
other place as your home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, mother, then I shall say that I'm going back to business
to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barfield/Barfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Barfield sighed.




<p/>XLVII


<p/>Days, weeks, months passed away, and the two women came to live more and
more like friends and less like mistress and maid. Not that Esther ever
failed to use the respectful <div class="bookquote">``ma'am''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div>when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mistress, nor
did they ever sit down to a meal at the same table. But these slight
social distinctions, which habit naturally preserved, and which it would
have been disagreeable to both to forego, were no check on the intimacy of
their companionship. In the evening they sat in the library sewing, or
Mrs. Barfield read aloud, or they talked of their sons. On Sundays they
had their meetings. The folk came from quite a distance, and sometimes as
many as five-and-twenty knelt round the deal table in the drawing room,
and Esther felt that these days were the happiest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) was
content in the peaceful present, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knew that Mrs. Barfield would not
leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) unprovided for. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) was almost free from anxiety. But Jack did
not seem to be able to obtain regular employment in London, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) wages
were so small that she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) could not help him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) much. So the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
handwriting made her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) tremble, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) sometimes did not show the letter to
Mrs. Barfield for some hours after.

<p/>One Sunday morning, after meeting, as the two women were going for their
walk up the hill, Esther said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've a letter from my boy, ma'am. I hope it is to tell me that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s got
back to work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Esther Waters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I shan't be able to read it, Esther. I haven't my glasses with
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It don't matter, ma'am--it'll keep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Give it to me--his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) writing is large and legible. I think I can read it.
``My dear mother, the place I told you of in my last letter was given away,
so I must go on in the toy-shop till something better turns up. I only get
six shillings a week and my tea, and can't quite manage on that.<div class="bookquote">'' Then
something--something--`pay three and sixpence a week'--something--`bed'
--something--something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know, ma'am; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shares a bed with the eldest boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes, that's it; and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wants to know if you can help him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I don't like
to trouble you, mother; but it is hard for a boy to get his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) living in
London.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I've sent him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) all my money. I shan't have any till next quarter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll lend you some, Esther. We can't leave the boy to starve. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) can't
live on two and sixpence a week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're very good, ma'am; but I don't like to take your money. We shan't
be able to get the garden cleared this winter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall manage somehow, Esther. The garden must wait. The first thing to
do is to see that your boy doesn't want for food.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The women</b></font>)</div><p/>The women resumed their walk up the hill. When they reached the top Mrs.
Barfield said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't heard from Mr. Arthur for months. I envy you, Esther, those
letters asking for a little money. What's the use of money to us except to
give it to our children? Helping others, that is the only happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barfield/Barfield</b></font>)</div><p/>At the end of the coombe, under the shaws, stood the old red-tiled
farmhouse in which Mrs. Barfield had been born. Beyond it, downlands
rolled on and on, reaching half-way up the northern sky. Mrs. Barfield was
thinking of the days when her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) husband used to jump off his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cob and walk
beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) through those gorse patches on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) way to the farmhouse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>)
had come from the farmhouse beneath the shaws to go to live in an Italian
house sheltered by a fringe of trees. That was her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) adventure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) knew it,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) turned from the view of the downs to the view of the sea. The
plantations of Woodview touched the horizon, then the line dipped, and
between the top branches of a row of elms appeared the roofs of the town.
Over a long spider-legged bridge a train wriggled like a snake, the bleak
river flowed into the harbour, and the shingle banks saved the low land
from inundation. Then the train passed behind the square, dogmatic tower
of the village church. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) husband lay beneath the chancel; her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) father,
mother, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) relations, lay in the churchyard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) would go there in a
few years... Her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) daughter lay far away, far away in Egypt. Upon this
downland all her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) life had been passed, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) life except the few months
she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) had spent by her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) daughter's bedside in Egypt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) had come from that
coombe, from that farmhouse beneath the shaws, and had only crossed the
down.

<p/>And this barren landscape meant as much to Esther as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mistress. It
was on these downs that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had walked with William. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had been born and
bred on these downs; but he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) lay far away in Brompton Cemetery; it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
who had come back! and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) simple way she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) too wondered at the mystery
of destiny.

<p/>As they descended the hill Mrs. Barfield asked Esther if she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) ever heard of
Fred Parsons.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, ma'am, I don't know what's become of him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if you were to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) again, would you care to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marry and begin life over again! All the worry and bother over again! Why
should I marry?--all I live for now is to see my boy settled in life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The women</b></font>)</div><p/>The women walked on in silence, passing by long ruins of stables,
coach-houses, granaries, rickyards, all in ruin and decay. The women
paused and went towards the garden; and removing some pieces of the broken
gate they entered a miniature wilderness. The espalier apple-trees had
disappeared beneath climbing weeds, and long briars had shot out from the
bushes, leaving few traces of the former walks--a damp, dismal place that
the birds seemed to have abandoned. Of the greenhouse only some broken
glass and a black broken chimney remained. A great elm had carried away a
large portion of the southern wall, and under the dripping trees an aged
peacock screamed for his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) lost mate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose that Jack will be able to find any more paying employment
this winter. We must send him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) six shillings a week; that, with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) is
earning, will make twelve; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'ll be able to live nicely on that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) would indeed. But, then, what about the wages of them
who was to have cleared the gardens for us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shan't be able to get the whole garden cleared, but Jim will be able
to get a piece ready for us to sow some spring vegetables, not a large
piece, but enough for us. The first thing to do will be to cut down those
apple-trees. I'm afraid we shall have to cut down that walnut; nothing
could grow beneath it. Did any one ever see such a mass of weed and briar?
Yet it is only about ten years since we left Woodview, and the garden was
let run to waste. Nature does not take long, a few years, a very few
years.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>XLVIII


<p/>All the winter the north wind roamed on the hills; many trees fell in the
park, and at the end of February Woodview seemed barer and more desolate
than ever; broken branches littered the roadway, and the tall trunks
showed their wounds. The women sat over their fire in the evening
listening to the blast, cogitating the work that awaited them as soon as
the weather showed signs of breaking.

<p/>Mrs. Barfield had laid by a few pounds during the winter; and the day that
Jim cleared out the first piece of espalier trees she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) spent entirely in
the garden, hardly able to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) eyes off him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>). But the pleasure of the
day was in a measure spoilt for her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) by the knowledge that on that day her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>)
son was riding in the great steeplechase. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) was full of fear for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
safety; she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) did not sleep that night, and hurried down at an early hour to
the garden to ask Jim for the newspaper which she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) to bring
her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) took some time to extract the paper from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) torn pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) isn't in the first three,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barfield/Barfield</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Barfield. <div class="bookquote">``I always know that
he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)'s safe if he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)'s in the first three. We must turn to the account of the
race to see if there were any accidents.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) turned over the paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s safe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) horse ran fourth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You worry yourself without cause, ma'am. A good rider like him (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) don't meet
with accidents.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The best riders are often killed, Esther. I never have an easy moment
when I hear he (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>)'s going to ride in these races. Supposing one day I were to
read that he (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) was carried back on a shutter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We mustn't let our thoughts run on such things, ma'am. If a war was to
break out to-morrow, what should I do? His (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) regiment would be ordered out.
It is sad to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) had to enlist. But, as he (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) said, he (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) couldn't go
on living on me any longer. Poor boy! ...We must keep on working, doing
the best we can for them. There are all sorts of chances, and we can only
pray that God may spare them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Esther, that's all we can do. Work on, work on to the end... But
your boy is coming to see you to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll be here by twelve o'clock.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're luckier than I am. I wonder if I shall ever see my boy again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am, of course you will. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll come back to you right enough one
of these days. There's a good time coming; that's what I always says...
And now I've got work to do in the house. Are you going to stop here, or
are you coming in with me? It'll do you no good standing about in the wet
clay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barfield/Barfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Barfield smiled and nodded, and Esther paused at the broken gate to
watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mistress, who stood superintending the clearing away of ten
years' growth of weeds, as much interested in the prospect of a few peas
and cabbages as in former days she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had been in the culture of expensive
flowers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) stood on what remained of a gravel walk, the heavy clay
clinging to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) boots, watching Jim piling weeds upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) barrow. Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
be able to finish the plot of ground by the end of the week? What should
they do with that great walnut-tree? Nothing would grow underneath it. Jim
was afraid that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) would not be able to cut it down and remove it without
help. Mrs. Barfield suggested sawing away some of the branches, but Jim
was not sure that the expedient would prove of much avail. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) opinion
the tree took all the goodness out of the soil, and that while it stood
they could not expect a very great show of vegetables. Mrs. Barfield asked
if the sale of the tree trunk would indemnify her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) for the cost of cutting
it down. Jim paused in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) work, and, leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) spade, considered if
there was any one in the town, who, for the sake of the timber, would cut
the tree down and take it away for nothing. There ought to be some such
person in town; if it came to that, Mrs. Barfield ought to receive
something for the tree. Walnut was a valuable wood, was extensively used
by cabinetmakers, and so on, until Mrs. Barfield begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) to get on with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) digging.

<p/>At twelve o'clock Esther and Mrs. Barfield walked out on the lawn. A loud
wind came up from the sea, and it shook the evergreens as if it were angry
with them. A rook carried a stick to the tops of the tall trees, and the
women drew their cloaks about them. The train passed across the vista, and
the women wondered how long it would take Jack to walk from the station.
Then another rook stooped to the edge of the plantation, gathered a twig,
and carried it away. The wind was rough; it caught the evergreens
underneath and blew them out like umbrellas; the grass had not yet begun
to grow, and the grey sea harmonised with the grey-green land. The women
waited on the windy lawn, their skirts blown against their legs, keeping
their hats on with difficulty. It was too cold for standing still. They
turned and walked a few steps towards the house, and then looked round.

<p/>A tall soldier came through the gate. He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) wore a long red cloak, and a
small cap jauntily set on the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) close-clipped head. Esther
uttered a little exclamation, and ran to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) mother in
his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) arms, kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and they walked towards Mrs. Barfield together. All
was forgotten in the happiness of the moment--the long fight for his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) life,
and the possibility that any moment might declare him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) to be mere food for
powder and shot. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) was only conscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) had accomplished her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>)
woman's work--she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) up to man's estate; and that was her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>)
sufficient reward. What a fine fellow he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was! She (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) did not know he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was so
handsome, and blushing with pleasure and pride she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) glanced shyly at him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
out of the corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) mistress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is my son, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barfield/Barfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Barfield held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Barfield</b></font>) hand to the young soldier.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard a great deal about you from your mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I of you, ma'am. You've been very kind to my mother. I don't know how
to thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And in silence they walked towards the house.
