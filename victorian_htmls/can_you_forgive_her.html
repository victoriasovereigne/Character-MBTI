<p/>Editorial note:

<p/>_Can You Forgive Her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)?_ was first published in monthly
installments -LRB-one shilling each-RRB- in 1864-1865. The first
book edition was published by Chapman and Hall in two
volumes -LRB-Volume I in 1864 and Volume II in 1865-RRB-.

<p/>Volume I was illustrated by Hablôt Knight Browne, better
known as <div class="bookquote">``Phiz''  (<font color='red'><b>Hablôt Knight Browne</b></font>)</div>and a favorite of Dickens. Trollope was
not pleased with Browne's work, and the illustrations for
Volume II were drawn by a Miss E. Taylor of St. Leonards.

<p/>VOLUME I.

<p/>CHAPTER I.

<p/>Mr. Vavasor and His (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) Daughter.


<p/>Whether or no, she (<font color='blue'><b>Daughter</b></font>), whom you are to forgive, if you can, did or did
not belong to the Upper Ten Thousand of this our English world, I am
not prepared to say with any strength of affirmation. By blood she (<font color='blue'><b>Daughter</b></font>)
was connected with big people,--distantly connected with some very
big people indeed, people who belonged to the Upper Ten Hundred if
there be any such division; but of these very big relations she (<font color='blue'><b>Daughter</b></font>) had
known and seen little, and they had cared as little for her (<font color='blue'><b>Daughter</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Daughter</b></font>)
grandfather, Squire Vavasor of Vavasor Hall, in Westmoreland, was a
country gentleman, possessing some thousand a year at the outside,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) therefore never came up to London, and had no ambition to have
himself numbered as one in any exclusive set. A hot-headed, ignorant,
honest old gentleman, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lived ever at Vavasor Hall, declaring to any
who would listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), that the country was going to the mischief,
and congratulating himself that at any rate, in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) county,
parliamentary reform had been powerless to alter the old political
arrangements. Alice Vavasor, whose offence against the world I am to
tell you, and if possible to excuse, was the daughter of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) younger
son; and as her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father, John Vavasor, had done nothing to raise
the family name to eminence, Alice could not lay claim to any high
position from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) birth as a Vavasor. John Vavasor had come up to
London early in life as a barrister, and had failed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had failed at
least in attaining either much wealth or much repute, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had
succeeded in earning, or perhaps I might better say, in obtaining,
a livelihood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had married a lady somewhat older than himself,
who was in possession of four hundred a year, and who was related
to those big people to whom I have alluded. Who these were and the
special nature of the relationship, I shall be called upon to explain
hereafter, but at present it will suffice to say that Alice Macleod
gave great offence to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) friends by her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) marriage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not,
however, give them much time for the indulgence of their anger.
Having given birth to a daughter within twelve months of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
marriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) died, leaving in abeyance that question as to whether
the fault of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) marriage should or should not be pardoned by her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
family.

<p/>When a man marries an heiress for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) money, if that money be within
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own control, as was the case with Miss Macleod's fortune, it is
generally well for the speculating lover that the lady's friends
should quarrel with him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) and with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is thereby driven to throw
herself entirely into the gentleman's arms, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) thus becomes
possessed of the wife and the money without the abominable nuisance
of stringent settlements. But the Macleods, though they quarrelled
with Alice, did not quarrel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) _à l'outrance_. They snubbed
herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) chosen husband; but they did not so far separate
themselves from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) affairs as to give up the charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
possessions. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) four hundred a year was settled very closely on
herself and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) children, without even a life interest having
been given to Mr. Vavasor, and therefore when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) died the mother's
fortune became the property of the little baby. But, under these
circumstances, the big people did not refuse to interest themselves
to some extent on behalf of the father. I do not suppose that any
actual agreement or compact was made between Mr. Vavasor and the
Macleods; but it came to be understood between them that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) made
no demand upon them for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) daughter's money, and allowed them to
have charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) education, they would do something for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was
a practising barrister, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) practice had never amounted to
much; and a practising barrister is always supposed to be capable of
filling any situation which may come his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) way. Two years after his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>)
wife's death Mr. Vavasor was appointed assistant commissioner in some
office which had to do with insolvents, and which was abolished three
years after his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) appointment. It was at first thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would
keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) eight hundred a year for life and be required to do nothing
for it; but a wretched cheeseparing Whig government, as John Vavasor
called it when describing the circumstances of the arrangement to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
father, down in Westmoreland, would not permit this; it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) the
option of taking four hundred a year for doing nothing, or of keeping
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) whole income and attending three days a week for three hours
a day during term time, at a miserable dingy little office near
Chancery Lane, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) duty would consist in signing his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) name to
accounts which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) never read, and at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was never supposed even
to look. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had sulkily elected to keep the money, and this signing
had been now for nearly twenty years the business of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) life. Of
course he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) considered himself to be a very hardly-used man. One Lord
Chancellor after another he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) petitioned, begging that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) might be
relieved from the cruelty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) position, and allowed to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>)
salary without doing anything in return for it. The amount of work
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) did perform was certainly a minimum of labour. Term time, as
terms were counted in Mr. Vavasor's office, hardly comprised half the
year, and the hours of weekly attendance did not do more than make
one day's work a week for a working man; but Mr. Vavasor had been
appointed an assistant commissioner, and with every Lord Chancellor
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) argued that all Westminster Hall, and Lincoln's Inn to boot, had
no right to call upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) to degrade himself by signing his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) name to
accounts. In answer to every memorial he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) was offered the alternative
of freedom with half his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) income; and so the thing went on.

<p/>There can, however, be no doubt that Mr. Vavasor was better off and
happier with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) almost nominal employment than he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would have been
without it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) always argued that it kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) in London; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
would undoubtedly have lived in London with or without his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) official
occupation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had become so habituated to London life in a small
way, before the choice of leaving London was open to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>), that
nothing would have kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) long away from it. After his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) wife's death
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) dined at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) club every day on which a dinner was not given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
by some friend elsewhere, and was rarely happy except when so dining.
They who have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) scanning the steward's list of dishes, and
giving the necessary orders for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) own and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) friend's dinner, at
about half past four in the afternoon, have seen John Vavasor at
the only moment of the day at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) is ever much in earnest. All
other things are light and easy to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>),--to be taken easily and to be
dismissed easily. Even the eating of the dinner calls forth from him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
no special sign of energy. Sometimes a frown will gather on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) brow
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) tastes the first half glass from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) bottle of claret; but as
a rule that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) has prepared for himself with so much elaborate
care, is consumed with only pleasant enjoyment. Now and again it will
happen that the cook is treacherous even to him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) can hit
hard; but in hitting he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) is quiet, and strikes with a smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>)
face.

<p/>Such had been Mr. Vavasor's pursuits and pleasures in life up to the
time at which my story commences. But I must not allow the reader to
suppose that he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) was a man without good qualities. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) when young
possessed the gift of industry I think that he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) might have shone in
his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) profession, and have been well spoken of and esteemed in the
world. As it was he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) was a discontented man, but nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) was
popular, and to some extent esteemed. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) was liberal as far as his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
means would permit; he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) was a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) word; and he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) understood well
that code of by-laws which was presumed to constitute the character
of a gentleman in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) circle. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knew how to carry himself well among
men, and understood thoroughly what might be said, and what might
not; what might be done among those with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lived, and what
should be left undone. By nature, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was kindly disposed, loving
many persons a little if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) loved few or none passionately. Moreover,
at the age of fifty, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a handsome man, with a fine forehead,
round which the hair and beard was only beginning to show itself to
be grey. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stood well, with a large person, only now beginning to
become corpulent. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes were bright and grey, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mouth and
chin were sharply cut, and told of gentle birth. Most men who knew
John Vavasor well, declared it to be a pity that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) should spend his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
time in signing accounts in Chancery Lane.

<p/>I have said that Alice Vavasor's big relatives cared but little for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) early years; but I have also said that they were careful
to undertake the charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) education, and I must explain away
this little discrepancy. The biggest of these big people had hardly
heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>); but there was a certain Lady Macleod, not very big
herself, but, as it were, hanging on to the skirts of those who
were so, who cared very much for Alice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was the widow of a Sir
Archibald Macleod, K.C.B., who had been a soldier, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) herself having
also been a Macleod by birth; and for very many years past--from
a time previous to the birth of Alice Vavasor--she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had lived at
Cheltenham, making short sojourns in London during the spring, when
the contents of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) limited purse would admit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) doing so. Of
old Lady Macleod I think I may say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) was a good woman;--that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) was a good woman, though subject to two of the most serious
drawbacks to goodness which can afflict a lady. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was a Calvinistic
Sabbatarian in religion, and in worldly matters she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was a devout
believer in the high rank of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) noble relatives. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could almost
worship a youthful marquis, though he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) lived a life that would
disgrace a heathen among heathens; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could and did, in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own
mind, condemn crowds of commonplace men and women to all eternal
torments of which her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) imagination could conceive, because they
listened to profane music in a park on Sunday. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was a good
woman. Out of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) small means she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gave much away. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) owed no man
anything. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) strove to love her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) neighbours. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bore much pain with
calm unspeaking endurance, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lived in trust of a better world.
Alice Vavasor, who was after all only her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) cousin, she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) loved with an
exceeding love, and yet Alice had done very much to extinguish such
love. Alice, in the years of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) childhood, had been brought up by
Lady Macleod; at the age of twelve she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had been sent to a school at
Aix-la-Chapelle,--a comitatus of her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) relatives having agreed that
such was to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) fate, much in opposition to Lady Macleod's
judgement; at nineteen she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had returned to Cheltenham, and after
remaining there for little more than a year, had expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>)
unwillingness to remain longer with her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) cousin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) could sympathize
neither with her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) relative's faults or virtues. She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) made an
arrangement, therefore, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) father, that they two would keep
house together in London, and so they had lived for the last five
years;--for Alice Vavasor when she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) will be introduced to the reader
had already passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) twenty-fourth birthday.

<p/>Their mode of life had been singular and certainly not in all
respects satisfactory. Alice when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was twenty-one had the full
command of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own fortune; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) induced her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father, who for
the last fifteen years had lived in lodgings, to take a small house
in Queen Anne Street, of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) offered to incur a portion of
the expense. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had warned her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) habits were not those of a
domestic man, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been content simply so to warn her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
not felt it to be his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) duty to decline the arrangement because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew
himself to be unable to give to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) child all that attention which
a widowed father under such circumstances should pay to an only
daughter. The house had been taken, and Alice and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had lived
together, but their lives had been quite apart. For a short time, for
a month or two, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had striven to dine at home and even to remain at
home through the evening; but the work had been too hard for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had utterly broken down. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) and to himself that
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) health would fail him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) under the effects of so great a change made
so late in life, and I am not sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had not spoken truly. At
any rate the effort had been abandoned, and Mr. Vavasor now never
dined at home. Nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) daughter ever dine out together.
Their joint means did not admit of their giving dinners, and
therefore they could not make their joint way in the same circle. It
thus came to pass that they lived apart,--quite apart. They saw each
other, probably daily; but they did little more than see each other.
They did not even breakfast together, and after three o'clock in the
day Mr. Vavasor was never to be found in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) own house.

<p/>Miss Vavasor had made for herself a certain footing in society,
though I am disposed to doubt her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) right to be considered as holding
a place among the Upper Ten Thousand. Two classes of people she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had
chosen to avoid, having been driven to such avoidings by her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) aunt's
preferences; marquises and such-like, whether wicked or otherwise,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had eschewed, and had eschewed likewise all Low Church
tendencies. The eschewing of marquises is not generally very
difficult. Young ladies living with their fathers on very moderate
incomes in or about Queen Anne Street are not usually much troubled
on that matter. Nor can I say that Miss Vavasor was so troubled. But
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) there was a certain definite thing to be done towards such
eschewal. Lady Macleod by no means avoided her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) noble relatives,
nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) at all avoid Alice Vavasor. When in London she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was
persevering in her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) visits to Queen Anne Street, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) considered
herself, nobody knew why, not to be on speaking terms with Mr.
Vavasor. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) strove hard to produce an intimacy between Alice
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) noble relatives--such an intimacy as that which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) herself
enjoyed;--an intimacy which gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) a footing in their houses but no
footing in their hearts, or even in their habits. But all this Alice
declined with as much consistency as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did those other struggles
which her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) old cousin made on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) behalf,--strong, never-flagging,
but ever-failing efforts to induce the girl to go to such places of
worship as Lady Macleod herself frequented.

<p/>A few words must be said as to Alice Vavasor's person; one fact
also must be told, and then, I believe, I may start upon my story.
As regards her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) character, I will leave it to be read in the story
itself. The reader already knows that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) appears upon the scene at
no very early age, and the mode of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) life had perhaps given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
an appearance of more years than those which she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) really possessed. It
was not that her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) face was old, but that there was nothing that was
girlish in her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) manners. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) demeanour was as staid, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) voice
as self-possessed as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had already been ten years married.
In person she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was tall and well made, rather large in her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) neck and
shoulders, as were all the Vavasors, but by no means fat. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) hair
was brown, but very dark, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) wore it rather lower upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
forehead than is customary at the present day. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) eyes, too, were
dark, though they were not black, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) complexion, though not
quite that of a brunette, was far away from being fair. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) nose was
somewhat broad, and _retroussé_ too, but to my thinking it was a
charming nose, full of character, and giving to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) face at times a
look of pleasant humour, which it would otherwise have lacked. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
mouth was large, and full of character, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) chin oval, dimpled,
and finely chiselled, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) father's. I beg you, in taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) for
all in all, to admit that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was a fine, handsome, high-spirited
young woman.

<p/>And now for my fact. At the time of which I am writing she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was
already engaged to be married.




<p/>CHAPTER II.

<p/>Lady Macleod.


<p/>I cannot say that the house in Queen Anne Street was a pleasant
house. I am now speaking of the material house, made up of the walls
and furniture, and not of any pleasantness or unpleasantness supplied
by the inmates. It was a small house on the south side of the street,
squeezed in between two large mansions which seemed to crush it,
and by which its fair proportion of doorstep and area was in truth
curtailed. The stairs were narrow; the dining-room was dark, and
possessed none of those appearances of plenteous hospitality which a
dining-room should have. But all this would have been as nothing if
the drawing-room had been pretty as it is the bounden duty of all
drawing-rooms to be. But Alice Vavasor's drawing-room was not pretty.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) father had had the care of furnishing the house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
intrusted the duty to a tradesman who had chosen green paper, a green
carpet, green curtains, and green damask chairs. There was a green
damask sofa, and two green arm-chairs opposite to each other at the
two sides of the fireplace. The room was altogether green, and was
not enticing. In shape it was nearly square, the very small back room
on the same floor not having been, as is usual, added to it. This had
been fitted up as a <div class="bookquote">``study''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>for Mr. Vavasor, and was very rarely used
for any purpose.

<p/>Most of us know when we enter a drawing-room whether it is a pretty
room or no; but how few of us know how to make a drawing-room pretty!
There has come up in London in these latter days a form of room so
monstrously ugly that I will venture to say that no other people on
earth but Londoners would put up with it. Londoners, as a rule, take
their houses as they can get them, looking only to situation, size,
and price. What Grecian, what Roman, what Turk, what Italian would
endure, or would ever have endured, to use a room with a monstrous
cantle in the form of a parallelogram cut sheerly out of one corner
of it? This is the shape of room we have now adopted,--or rather
which the builders have adopted for us,--in order to throw the whole
first floor into one apartment which may be presumed to have noble
dimensions,--with such drawback from it as the necessities of the
staircase may require. A sharp unadorned corner projects itself into
these would-be noble dimensions, and as ugly a form of chamber is
produced as any upon which the eye can look. I would say more on
the subject if I dared to do so here, but I am bound now to confine
myself to Miss Vavasor's room. The monstrous deformity of which I
have spoken was not known when that house in Queen Anne Street was
built. There is to be found no such abomination of shape in the
buildings of our ancestors,--not even in the days of George the
Second. But yet the drawing-room of which I speak was ugly, and Alice
knew that it was so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew that it was ugly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would greatly
have liked to banish the green sofa, to have re-papered the wall, and
to have hung up curtains with a dash of pink through them. With the
green carpet she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would have been contented. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father was an
extravagant man; and from the day on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had come of age she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had determined that it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) special duty to avoid extravagance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the ugliest room I ever saw in my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father once said
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not very pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go halves with you in the expense of redoing it,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Vavasor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't that be extravagant, papa? The things have not been here
quite four years yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Mr. Vavasor had shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) shoulders and said nothing more
about it. It was little to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) whether the drawing-room in Queen
Anne Street was ugly or pretty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was on the committee of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) club,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) took care that the furniture there should be in all respects
comfortable.

<p/>It was now June; and that month Lady Macleod was in the habit of
spending among her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) noble relatives in London when she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had succeeded
in making both ends so far overlap each other at Cheltenham as to
give her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) the fifty pounds necessary for this purpose. For though she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>)
spent her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) month in London among her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) noble friends, it must not be
supposed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) noble friends gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) bed or board. They sometimes
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) tea, such as it was, and once or twice in the month they
gave the old lady a second-rate dinner. On these occasions she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
hired a little parlour and bedroom behind it in King Street, Saint
James's, and lived a hot, uncomfortable life, going about at nights
to gatherings of fashionable people of which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart
disapproved, seeking for smiles which seldom came to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and which
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) excused herself for desiring because they were the smiles of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
kith and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) kin, telling herself always that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) made this vain
journey to the modern Babylon for the good of Alice Vavasor, and
telling herself as often that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) now made it for the last time. On
the occasion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) preceding visit she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had reminded herself that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was then seventy-five years old, and had sworn to herself that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would come to London no more; but here she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was again in London,
having justified the journey to herself on the plea that there were
circumstances in Alice's engagement which made it desirable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
should for a while be near her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) niece. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) niece, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought, was
hardly managing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own affairs discreetly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, as the old lady walked into the
drawing-room one morning at eleven o'clock. Alice always called Lady
Macleod her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) aunt, though, as has been before explained, there was no
such close connexion between them. During Lady Macleod's sojourn in
London these morning visits were made almost every day. Alice never
denied herself, and even made a point of remaining at home to receive
them unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had previously explained that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would be out; but I
am not prepared to say that they were, of their own nature, agreeable
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you mind shutting the window, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div>said Lady Macleod,
seating herself stiffly on one of the small ugly green chairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>)
had been educated at a time when easy-chairs were considered vicious,
and among people who regarded all easy postures as being so; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>)
could still boast, at seventy-six, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) never leaned back. <div class="bookquote">``Would
you mind shutting the window? I'm so warm that I'm afraid of the
draught.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``Would you mind shutting the window?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean to say that you've walked from King Street,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said
Alice, doing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was desired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I do,--every step of the way. Cabs are so ruinous. It's a
most unfortunate thing; they always say it's just over the two miles
here. I don't believe a word of it, because I'm only a little more
than the half-hour walking it; and those men will say anything. But
how can I prove it, you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I really think it's too far for you to walk when it's so warm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what can I do, my dear? I must come, when I've specially come up
to London to see you. I shall have a cab back again, because it'll
be hotter then, and dear Lady Midlothian has promised to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>)
carriage at three to take me to the concert. I do so wish you'd go,
Alice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's out of the question, aunt. The idea of my going in that way at
the last moment, without any invitation!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It wouldn't be without an invitation, Alice. The marchioness has
said to me over and over again how glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would be to see you, if
I would bring you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) come and call if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is so anxious to know me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, you've no right to expect it; you haven't indeed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) never
calls even on me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know I've no right, and I don't expect it, and I don't want
it. But neither has she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) a right to suppose that, under such
circumstances, I shall go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) house. You might as well give it up,
aunt. Cart ropes wouldn't drag me there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you are very wrong,--particularly under your present
circumstances. A young woman that is going to be married, as you
are--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As I am,--perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's nonsense, Alice. Of course you are; and for his (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sake you are
bound to cultivate any advantages that naturally belong to you. As to
Lady Midlothian or the marchioness coming to call on you here in your
father's house, after all that has passed, you really have no right
to look for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I don't look for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That sort of people are not expected to call. If you'll think of it,
how could they do it with all the demands they have on their time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear aunt, I wouldn't interfere with their time for worlds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody can say of me, I'm sure, that I run after great people or
rich people. It does happen that some of the nearest relations I
have,--indeed I may say the nearest relations,--are people of high
rank; and I do not see that I'm bound to turn away from my own flesh
and blood because of that, particularly when they are always so
anxious to keep up the connexion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was only speaking of myself, aunt. It is very different with you.
You have known them all your life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how are you to know them if you won't begin? Lady Midlothian
said to me only yesterday that she (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) was glad to hear that you were
going to be married so respectably, and then--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word I'm very much obliged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) ladyship. I wonder whether
she (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) considered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) married respectably when she (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) took Lord
Midlothian?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Now Lady Midlothian had been unfortunate in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) marriage, having
united herself to a man of bad character, who had used her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ill, and
from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had now been for some years separated. Alice might have
spared her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) allusion to this misfortune when speaking of the countess
to the cousin who was so fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was angered by the
application of that odious word respectable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own prospects;
and perhaps the more angered as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was somewhat inclined to feel
that the epithet did suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own position. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) engagement, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had sometimes told herself, was very respectable, and had as often
told herself that it lacked other attractions which it should have
possessed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was not quite pleased with herself in having accepted
John Grey,--or rather perhaps was not satisfied with herself in
having loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). In her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) many thoughts on the subject, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) always
admitted to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) simply because she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>);--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) quick assent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) quick proposal
simply because he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had won her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heart. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was sometimes almost
angry with herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had permitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heart to be thus easily
taken from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and had rebuked herself for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) girlish facility.
But the marriage would be at any rate respectable. Mr. Grey was a man
of high character, of good though moderate means; he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was, too, well
educated, of good birth, a gentleman, and a man of talent. No one
could deny that the marriage would be highly respectable, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
father had been more than satisfied. Why Miss Vavasor herself was
not quite satisfied will, I hope, in time make itself appear. In the
meanwhile it can be understood that Lady Midlothian's praise would
gall her (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice, don't be uncharitable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div>said Lady Macleod severely. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever
may have been Lady Midlothian's misfortunes no one can say they have
resulted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) own fault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes they can, aunt, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) married a man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) knew to be a
scapegrace because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very rich and an earl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was the daughter of a nobleman herself, and only married in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) own degree. But I don't want to discuss that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) meant to be
good-natured when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) mentioned your marriage, and you should take
it as it was meant. After all she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was only your mother's second
cousin--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear aunt, I make no claim on her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) cousinship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) admits the claim, and is quite anxious that you should know
her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) has been at the trouble to find out everything about Mr.
Grey, and told me that nothing could be more satisfactory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word I am very much obliged to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Macleod was a woman of much patience, and possessed also
of considerable perseverance. For another half-hour she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) went on
expatiating on the advantages which would accrue to Alice as a
married woman from an acquaintance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) noble relatives, and
endeavouring to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that no better opportunity than the
present would present itself. There would be a place in Lady
Midlothian's carriage, as none other of the daughters were going but
Lady Jane. Lady Midlothian would take it quite as a compliment, and a
concert was not like a ball or any customary party. An unmarried girl
might very properly go to a concert under such circumstances as now
existed without any special invitation. Lady Macleod ought to have
known her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) adopted niece better. Alice was immoveable. As a matter
of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was immoveable. Lady Macleod had seldom been able to
persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) to anything, and ought to have been well sure that, of
all things, she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) could not have persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) to this.

<p/>Then, at last, they came to another subject, as to which Lady Macleod
declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had specially come on this special morning,
forgetting, probably, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had already made the same assertion
with reference to the concert. But in truth the last assertion was
the correct one, and on that other subject she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had been hurried
on to say more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) meant by the eagerness of the moment. All
the morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had been full of the matter on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) was now
about to speak. She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had discussed it quite at length with Lady
Midlothian;--though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was by no means prepared to tell Alice
Vavasor that any such discussion had taken place. From the concert,
and the effect which Lady Midlothian's countenance might have upon
Mr. Grey's future welfare, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) got herself by degrees round to a
projected Swiss tour which Alice was about to make. Of this Swiss
tour she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had heard before, but had not heard who were to be Miss
Vavasor's companions until Lady Midlothian had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>). How it had
come to pass that Lady Midlothian had interested herself so much in
the concerns of a person whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) did not know, and on whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) greatness could not be expected to call, I cannot say; but from
some quarter she (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) had learned who were the proposed companions of
Alice Vavasor's tour, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had told Lady Macleod that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) did not
at all approve of the arrangement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And when do you go, Alice?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div>said Lady Macleod.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Early in July, I believe. It will be very hot, but Kate must be back
by the middle of August.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>Kate Vavasor was Alice's first cousin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Kate is to go with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) is. I could not go alone, or with no one but George.
Indeed it was Kate who made up the party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you could not go alone with George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div>said Lady Macleod,
very grimly. Now George Vavasor was Kate's brother, and was therefore
also first cousin to Alice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was heir to the old squire down in
Westmoreland, with whom Kate lived, their father being dead. Nothing,
it would seem, could be more rational than that Alice should go to
Switzerland with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousins; but Lady Macleod was clearly not of
this opinion; she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) looked very grim as she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) made this allusion to
cousin George, and seemed to be preparing herself for a fight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is exactly what I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>answered Alice. <div class="bookquote">``But, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is
simply going as an escort to me and Kate, as we don't like the rôle
of unprotected females. It is very good-natured of him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), seeing how
much his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) time is taken up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) never did anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's because you don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; certainly I don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not add that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had no
wish to know Mr. George Vavasor, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked it. <div class="bookquote">``And has your
father been told that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And does--''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div>Lady Macleod hesitated a little before she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) went on, and
then finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) question with a little spasmodic assumption of
courage. <div class="bookquote">``And does Mr. Grey know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) is going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice remained silent for a full minute before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) answered this
question, during which Lady Macleod sat watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) grimly, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>)
eyes very intent upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) niece's face. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) supposed such silence
to have been in any degree produced by shame in answering the
question, she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) was much mistaken. But it may be doubted whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>)
understood the character of the girl whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) knew so
well, and it is probable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) did make such mistake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I might tell you simply that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice at last, <div class="bookquote">``seeing
that I wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) yesterday, letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) know that such were our
arrangements; but I feel that I should not thus answer the question
you mean to ask. You want to know whether Mr. Grey will approve of it.
As I only wrote yesterday of course I have not heard, and therefore
cannot say. But I can say this, aunt, that much as I might regret his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
disapproval, it would make no change in my plans.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would it not? Then I must tell you, you are very wrong. It ought
to make a change. What! the disapproval of the man you are going to
marry make no change in your plans?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in that matter. Come, aunt, if we must discuss this matter let
us do it at any rate fairly. In an ordinary way, if Mr. Grey had asked
me to give up for any reason my trip altogether, I should have given
it up certainly, as I would give up any other indifferent project at
the request of so dear a friend,--a friend with whom I am so--so--so
closely connected. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) asked me not to travel with my cousin
George, I should refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) absolutely, without a word of parley
on the subject, simply because of the nature and closeness of my
connection with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). I suppose you understand what I mean, aunt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I do. You mean that you would refuse to obey him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) on the
very subject on which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has a right to claim your obedience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has no right to claim my obedience on any subject,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice;
and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) spoke Aunt Macleod jumped up with a little start at the
vehemence of the words, and of the tone in which they were expressed.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had heard that tone before, and might have been used to it; but,
nevertheless, the little jump was involuntary. <div class="bookquote">``At present he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has no
right to my obedience on any subject, but least of all on that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said
Alice. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) advice he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) may give me, but I am quite sure he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will not
ask for obedience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) advises you you will slight his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) advice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) tells me that I had better not travel with my cousin George I
shall certainly not take his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) advice. Moreover, I should be careful to
let him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) know how much I was offended by any such counsel from him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).
It would show a littleness on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) part, and a suspicion of which I
cannot suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to be capable.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said this, got up
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) seat and walked about the room. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had finished she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
stood at one of the windows with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) visitor. There was
silence between them for a minute or two, during which Lady Macleod
was deeply considering how best she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) might speak the terrible words,
which, as Alice's nearest female relative, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt herself bound to
utter. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) collected her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thoughts and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) courage, and spoke
out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Alice, I need hardly say that if you had a mother living,
or any person with you filling the place of a mother, I should not
interfere in this matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, Aunt Macleod, if you think I am wrong you have quite a
right to say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do think you are wrong,--very wrong, indeed; and if you persist in
this I am afraid I must say that I shall think you wicked. Of course
Mr. Grey cannot like you to travel with George Vavasor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why not, aunt?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) asked this question, turned round
and confronted Lady Macleod boldly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) spoke with a steady voice,
and fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) eyes upon the old lady's face, as though determined to
show that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had no fear of what might be said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not, Alice? Surely you do not wish me to say why not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do wish you to say why not. How can I defend myself till the
accusation is made?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are now engaged to marry Mr. Grey, with the consent and
approbation of all your friends. Two years ago you had--had--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had what, aunt? If you mean to say that two years ago I was engaged
to my cousin George you are mistaken. Three years ago I told him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
that under certain conditions I would become engaged to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). But my
conditions did not suit him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), nor his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) me, and no engagement was ever
made. Mr. Grey knows the history of the whole thing. As far as it was
possible I have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) everything that took place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The fact was, Alice, that George Vavasor's mode of life was such
that an engagement with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would have been absolute madness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear aunt, you must excuse me if I say that I cannot discuss George
Vavasor's mode of life. If I were thinking of becoming his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) wife you
would have a perfect right to discuss it, because of your constant
kindness to me. But as matters are he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) is simply a cousin; and as I
like him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) and you do not, we had better say nothing about him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must say this--that after what has passed, and at the present
crisis of your life--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear aunt, I'm not in any crisis.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes you are, Alice; in the most special crisis of a girl's life. You
are still a girl, but you are the promised wife of a very worthy man,
who will look to you for all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) domestic happiness. George Vavasor
has the name, at least, of being very wild.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The worthy man and the wild man must fight it out between them. If I
were going away with George by himself, there might be something in
what you say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be monstrous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monstrous or not, it isn't what I'm about to do. Kate and I have put
our purses together, and are going to have an outing for our special
fun and gratification. As we should be poor travellers alone, George
has promised to go with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sister. Papa knows all about it, and
never thought of making any objection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Macleod shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) did not like to say anything against
Mr. Vavasor before his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) daughter; but the shaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) head was
intended to signify that Mr. Vavasor's assent in such a matter was
worth nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can only say again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div>said Lady Macleod, <div class="bookquote">``that I think Mr. Grey
will be displeased,--and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) will have very great cause for
displeasure. And I think, moreover, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) approbation ought to be
your chief study. I believe, my dear, I'll ask you to let Jane get me
a cab. I shan't have a bit too much time to dress for the concert.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice simply rang the bell, and said no further word on the subject
which they had been discussing. When Lady Macleod got up to go away,
Alice kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), as was customary with them, and the old lady as
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went uttered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) customary valediction. <div class="bookquote">``God bless you, my dear.
Good-bye! I'll come to-morrow if I can.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was therefore no
quarrel between them. But both of them felt that words had been
spoken which must probably lead to some diminution of their past
intimacy.

<p/>When Lady Macleod had gone Alice sat alone for an hour thinking of
what had passed between them,--thinking rather of those two men, the
worthy man and the wild man, whose names had been mentioned in close
connection with herself. John Grey was a worthy man, a man worthy at
all points, as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) told herself it was so. And
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) told herself, also, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin George was wild,--very wild.
And yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thoughts were, I fear, on the whole more kindly towards
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin than towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) lover. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had declared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) aunt that
John Grey would be incapable of such suspicion as would be shown by
any objection on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) part to the arrangements made for the tour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had said so, and had so believed; and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) continued to brood
over the position which her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) affairs would take, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) did make the
objection which Lady Macleod anticipated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) told herself over and
over again, that under such circumstances she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) would not give way an
inch. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is free to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) said to herself. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) does not trust
me he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is quite free to go.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It may almost be said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) came at
last to anticipate from her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) lover that very answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) own letter
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had declared him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) to be incapable of making.




<p/>CHAPTER III.

<p/>John Grey, the Worthy Man.


<p/>Mr. Grey's answer to Alice Vavasor's letter, which was duly sent by
return of post and duly received on the morning after Lady Macleod's
visit, may perhaps be taken as giving a sample of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) worthiness. It
was dated from Nethercoats, a small country-house in Cambridgeshire
which belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) already spent much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) time,
and at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) intended to live altogether after his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) marriage.


<p/>Nethercoats, June, 186--.

<p/>DEAREST ALICE,

<p/>I am glad you have settled your affairs,--foreign affairs,
I mean,--so much to your mind. As to your home affairs
they are not, to my thinking, quite so satisfactorily
arranged. But as I am a party interested in the latter my
opinion may perhaps have an undue bias. Touching the tour,
I quite agree with you that you and Kate would have been
uncomfortable alone. It's a very fine theory, that of
women being able to get along without men as well as with
them; but, like other fine theories, it will be found very
troublesome by those who first put it in practice. Gloved
hands, petticoats, feminine softness, and the general
homage paid to beauty, all stand in the way of success.
These things may perhaps some day be got rid of, and
possibly with advantage; but while young ladies are still
encumbered with them a male companion will always be found
to be a comfort. I don't quite know whether your cousin
George is the best possible knight you might have chosen.
I should consider myself to be infinitely preferable,
had my going been upon the cards. Were you in danger
of meeting Paynim foes, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), no doubt, would kill them
off much quicker than I could do, and would be much
more serviceable in liberating you from the dungeons
of oppressors, or even from stray tigers in the Swiss
forests. But I doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) being punctual with the luggage.
He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will want you or Kate to keep the accounts, if any are
kept. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will be slow in getting you glasses of water at
the railway stations, and will always keep you waiting at
breakfast. I hold that a man with two ladies on a tour
should be an absolute slave to them, or they will not
fully enjoy themselves. He (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) should simply be an upper
servant, with the privilege of sitting at the same table
with his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) mistresses. I have my doubts as to whether your
cousin is fit for the place; but, as to myself, it is just
the thing that I was made for. Luckily, however, neither
you nor Kate are without wills of your own, and perhaps
you may be able to reduce Mr. Vavasor to obedience.

<p/>As to the home affairs I have very little to say here,--in
this letter. I shall of course run up and see you before
you start, and shall probably stay a week in town. I know
I ought not to do so, as it will be a week of idleness,
and yet not a week of happiness. I'd sooner have an hour
with you in the country than a whole day in London. And I
always feel in town that I've too much to do to allow of
my doing anything. If it were sheer idleness I could enjoy
it, but it is a feverish idleness, in which one is driven
here and there, expecting some gratification which not
only never comes, but which never even begins to come. I
will, however, undergo a week of it,--say the last seven
days of this month, and shall trust to you to recompense
me by as much of yourself as your town doings will permit.

<p/>And now again as to those home affairs. If I say nothing
now I believe you will understand why I refrain. You
have cunningly just left me to imply, from what you say,
that all my arguments have been of no avail; but you do
not answer them, or even tell me that you have decided.
I shall therefore imply nothing, and still trust to my
personal eloquence for success. Or rather not trust,--not
trust, but hope.

<p/>The garden is going on very well. We are rather short of
water, and therefore not quite as bright as I had hoped;
but we are preparing with untiring industry for future
brightness. Your commands have been obeyed in all things,
and Morrison always says <div class="bookquote">``The mistress didn't mean this,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Morrison</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``The mistress did intend that.''  (<font color='red'><b>Morrison</b></font>)</div>God bless the mistress
is what I now say, and send her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) home, to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) own home,
to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) flowers, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) fruit, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) house, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
husband, as soon as may be, with no more of these delays
which are to me so grievous, and which seem to me to be
so unnecessary. That is my prayer.

<p/>Yours ever and always,

<p/>J. G.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't give commands,''  (<font color='red'><b>J. G.</b></font>)</div>Alice said to herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat with the
letter at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) solitary breakfast-table. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) asked me how I liked the
things, and of course I was obliged to say. I was obliged to seem to
care, even if I didn't care.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Such were her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) first thoughts as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) put
the letter back into its envelope, after reading it the second time.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) opened it, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did quickly, not pausing a moment
lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should suspect herself of fearing to see what might be
its contents, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mind was full of that rebuke which her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) aunt had
anticipated, and which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had almost taught herself to expect. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had torn the letter open rapidly, and had dashed at its contents with
quick eyes. In half a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had seen what was the nature of the
reply respecting the proposed companion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tour, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
completed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) reading slowly enough. <div class="bookquote">``No; I gave no commands,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
repeated to herself, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might thereby absolve herself from
blame in reference to some possible future accusations, which might
perhaps be brought against her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) under certain circumstances which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
was contemplating.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) considered the letter bit by bit, taking it backwards, and
sipping her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tea every now and then amidst her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thoughts. No; she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
no home, no house, there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had no husband;--not as yet. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) spoke
of their engagement as though it were a betrothal, as betrothals used
to be of yore; as though they were already in some sort married. Such
betrothals were not made now-a-days. There still remained, both to
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), a certain liberty of extricating themselves from this
engagement. Should he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) and say that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) found that their
contemplated marriage would not make him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) happy, would not she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) release
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) without a word of reproach? Would not she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) regard him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) as much
more honourable in doing so than in adhering to a marriage which was
distasteful to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)? And if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would so judge him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),--judge him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) and
certainly acquit him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>), was it not reasonable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) under similar
circumstances should expect a similar acquittal? Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) declared
to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) carried on this argument within her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own breast
simply as an argument, induced to do so by that assertion on his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) part
that he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) was already her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) husband,--that his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) house was even now her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had no intention of using that power which was still hers.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had no wish to go back from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) pledged word. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had no such wish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) much, and admired him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) even more
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) was noble, generous, clever, good,--so good as
to be almost perfect; nay, for aught she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) was perfect. Would
that he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) had some faults! Would that he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) had! Would that he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) had! How
could she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), full of faults as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew herself to be,--how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
hope to make happy a man perfect as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was! But then there would
be no doubt as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) present duty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and that was
everything. Having told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and having on that
score accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love, nothing but a change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heart towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could justify her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in seeking to break the bond which bound them
together. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had once loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin. Yes, truly it was so. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
thoughts she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not now deny it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), and was
tormented by a feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had had a more full delight in that
love than in this other that had sprung up subsequently. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had told
herself that this had come of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) youth;--that love at twenty was
sweeter than it could be afterwards. There had been a something of
rapture in that earlier dream which could never be repeated,--which
could never live, indeed, except in a dream. Now, now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was
older and perhaps wiser, love meant a partnership, in which each
partner would be honest to the other, in which each would wish and
strive for the other's welfare, so that thus their joint welfare
might be insured. Then, in those early girlish days, it had meant
a total abnegation of self. The one was of earth, and therefore
possible. The other had been a ray from heaven,--and impossible,
except in a dream.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been mistaken in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) first love. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) admitted that
frankly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had worshipped had been an idol of clay, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
knew that it was well for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to have abandoned that idolatry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
not only been untrue to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), but, worse than that, had been false in
excusing his (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) untruth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had not only promised falsely, but had made
such promises with a deliberate, premeditated falsehood. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
been selfish, coldly selfish, weighing the value of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own low lusts
against that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) holy love. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had known this, and had parted
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) with an oath to herself that no promised contrition on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
part should ever bring them again together. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had pardoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
as a man, though never as a lover, and had bade him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) welcome again
as a cousin and as her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) friend's brother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had again become very
anxious as to his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) career, not hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) regard, but professing that
anxiety aloud. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) to be clever, ambitious, bold,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
believed even yet, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own experience, that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) might not
be bad at heart. Now, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) told herself that in truth she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) loved the
man to whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) troth was plighted, I fear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) almost thought
more of that other man from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had torn herself asunder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) find himself unhappy in London?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went
back to the letter. <div class="bookquote">``Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pretend to condemn the very place
which most men find the fittest for all their energies? Were I a man,
no earthly consideration should induce me to live elsewhere. It is
odd how we differ in all things. However brilliant might be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
light, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be contented to hide it under a bushel!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) recurred to that matter as to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been
so anxious when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) first opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) lover's letter. It will be
remembered how assured she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had expressed herself that Mr. Grey would
not condescend to object to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) travelling with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had
not so condescended. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had written on the matter with a pleasant
joke, like a gentleman as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was, disdaining to allude to the past
passages in the life of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) whom he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) loved, abstaining even from
expressing anything that might be taken as a permission on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) part.
There had been in Alice's words, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) of their proposed
plan, a something that had betrayed a tremor in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thoughts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had studiously striven so to frame her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) phrases that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tale might
be told as any other simple statement,--as though there had been no
trembling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mind as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wrote. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had failed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had failed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had failed; and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had read all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) effort
and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) failure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was quite conscious of this; she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt it
thoroughly; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was noble and a gentleman to the
last drop of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) blood. And yet--yet--yet there was almost a feeling
of disappointment in that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had not written such a letter as Lady
Macleod had anticipated.

<p/>During the next week Lady Macleod still came almost daily to Queen
Anne Street, but nothing further was said between her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) and Miss
Vavasor as to the Swiss tour; nor were any questions asked about Mr.
Grey's opinion on the subject. The old lady of course discovered
that there was no quarrel, or, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) believed, any probability of a
quarrel; and with that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was obliged to be contented. Nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
again on this occasion attempt to take Alice to Lady Midlothian's.
Indeed, their usual subjects of conversation were almost abandoned,
and Lady Macleod's visits, though they were as constant as
heretofore, were not so long. She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) did not dare to talk about Mr. Grey,
and because she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) did not so dare, was determined to regard herself as
in a degree ill-used. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) was silent, reserved, and fretful. At
length came the last day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) London season, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) last visit
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) niece. <div class="bookquote">``I would come because it's my last day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div>said Lady
Macleod; <div class="bookquote">``but really I'm so hurried, and have so many things to do,
that I hardly know how to manage it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) aunt an affectionate squeeze
of the hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm keeping the cab, so I can just stay twenty-five minutes. I've
marked the time accurately, but I know the man will swear it's over
the half-hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll have no more trouble about cabs, aunt, when you are back in
Cheltenham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The flies are worse, my dear. I really think they're worse. I pay
the bill every month, but they've always one down that I didn't have.
It's the regular practice, for I've had them from all the men in the
place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's hard enough to find honest men anywhere, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or honest women either. What do you think of Mrs. Green wanting to
charge me for an extra week, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) says I didn't give her (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>)
notice till Tuesday morning? I won't pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) may stop my
things if she (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) dares. However, it's the last time. I shall never come
up to London again, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, aunt, don't say that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do say it, my dear. What should an old woman like me do,
trailing up to town every year, merely because it's what people
choose to call the season.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To see your friends, of course. Age doesn't matter when a person's
health is so good as yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you knew what I suffer from lumbago,--though I must say coming
to London always does cure that for the time. But as for friends--!
Well, I suppose one has no right to complain when one gets to be as
old as I am; but I declare I believe that those I love best would
sooner be without me than with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean me, aunt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear, I don't mean you. Of course my life would have been
very different if you could have consented to remain with me till you
were married. But I didn't mean you. I don't know that I meant any
one. You shouldn't mind what an old woman like me says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a little melancholy because you're going away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed. I don't know why I stayed the last week. I did say to
Lady Midlothian that I thought I should go on the 20th; and, though I
know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) knew that I really didn't go, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) has not once sent to
me since. To be sure they've been out every night; but I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
might have asked me to come and lunch. It's so very lonely dining by
myself in lodgings in London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet you never will come and dine with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear; no. But we won't talk about that. I've just one word
more to say. Let me see. I've just six minutes to stay. I've made
up my mind that I'll never come up to town again,--except for one
thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what's that, aunt?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) asked the question, well knew
what that one thing was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll come for your marriage, my dear. I do hope you will not keep me
long waiting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I can't make any promise. There's no knowing when that may be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why should there be no knowing? I always think that when a girl
is once engaged the sooner she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s married the better. There may be
reasons for delay on the gentleman's part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There very often are, you know,''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Alice, you don't mean to say that Mr. Grey is putting it off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice was silent for a moment, during which Lady Macleod's face
assumed a look of almost tragic horror. Was there something wrong on
Mr. Grey's side of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was altogether unaware? Alice, though for
a second or two she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been guilty of a slight playful deceit, was
too honest to allow the impression to remain. <div class="bookquote">``No, aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said;
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Grey is not putting it off. It has been left to me to fix the
time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why don't you fix it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is such a serious thing! After all it is not more than four
months yet since I--I accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). I don't know that there has been
any delay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you might fix the time now, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) wishes it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, perhaps I shall,--some day, aunt. I'm going to think about it,
and you mustn't drive me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you should have some one to advise you, Alice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! that's just it. People always do seem to think it so terrible
that a girl should have her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own way in anything. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mustn't like any
one at first; and then, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) does like some one, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must marry
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) directly she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s bidden. I haven't much of my own way at present;
but you see, when I'm married I shan't have it at all. You can't
wonder that I shouldn't be in a hurry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not advocating anything like hurry, my dear. But, goodness
gracious me! I've been here twenty-eight minutes, and that horrid
man will impose upon me. Good-bye; God bless you! Mind you write.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div>And Lady Macleod hurried out of the room more intent at the present
moment upon saving her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) sixpence than she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) was on any other matter
whatsoever.

<p/>And then John Grey came up to town, arriving a day or two after the
time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had fixed. It is not, perhaps, improbable that Alice
had used some diplomatic skill in preventing a meeting between Lady
Macleod and her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) lover. They both were very anxious to obtain the same
object, and Alice was to some extent opposed to their views. Had Lady
Macleod and John Grey put their forces together she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) might have found
herself unable to resist their joint endeavours. She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) was resolved
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) would not at any rate name any day for her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) marriage before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) return from Switzerland; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) may therefore have thought it
wise to keep Mr. Grey in the country till after Lady Macleod had gone,
even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) thereby cut down the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) sojourn in London
to four days. On the occasion of that visit Mr. Vavasor did a very
memorable thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) dined at home with the view of welcoming his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
future son-in-law. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) dined at home, and asked, or rather assented
to Alice's asking, George and Kate Vavasor to join the dinner-party.
<div class="bookquote">``What an auspicious omen for the future nuptials!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) little sarcastic smile. <div class="bookquote">``Uncle John dines at home, and Mr. Grey
joins in the dissipation of a dinner-party. We shall all be changed
soon, I suppose, and George and I will take to keeping a little
cottage in the country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Kate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, angrily, <div class="bookquote">``I think you are about the most unjust
person I ever met. I would forgive your raillery, however painful it
might be, if it were only fair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And to whom is it unfair on the present occasion;--to your father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not intended for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I care nothing as to myself; you know that very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it must have been unfair to Mr. Grey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; it was Mr. Grey whom you meant to attack. If I can forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
for not caring for society, surely you might do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly; but that's just what you can't do, my dear. You don't
forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). If you did you might be quite sure that I should say
nothing. And if you choose to bid me hold my tongue I will say
nothing. But when you tell me all your own thoughts about this
thing you can hardly expect but that I should let you know mine in
return. I'm not particular; and if you are ready for a little good,
wholesome, useful hypocrisy, I won't balk you. I mayn't be quite so
dishonest as you call me, but I'm not so wedded to truth but what I
can look, and act, and speak a few falsehoods if you wish it. Only
let us understand each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know I wish for no falsehood, Kate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it's very hard to understand what you do wish. I know that
for the last year or two I have been trying to find out your wishes,
and, upon my word, my success has been very indifferent. I suppose
you wish to marry Mr. Grey, but I'm by no means certain. I suppose the
last thing on earth you'd wish would be to marry George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The very last. You're right there at any rate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice--! sometimes you drive me too hard; you do, indeed. You make
me doubt whether I hate or love you most. Knowing what my feelings
are about George, I cannot understand how you can bring yourself to
speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to me with such contempt!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>Kate Vavasor, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) spoke
these words, left the room with a quick step, and hurried up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
own chamber. There Alice found her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in tears, and was driven by her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
friend's real grief into the expression of an apology, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
knew was not properly due from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). Kate was acquainted with all the
circumstances of that old affair between her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother and Alice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
had given in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) adhesion to the propriety of what Alice had done.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had allowed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) brother George's behaviour had been such as
to make any engagement between them impossible. The fault, therefore,
had been hers in making any reference to the question of such a
marriage. Nor had it been by any means her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) first fault of the same
kind. Till Alice had become engaged to Mr. Grey she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had spoken of
George only as her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) brother, or as her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) friend's cousin, but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
was constantly making allusion to those past occurrences, which all
of them should have striven to forget. Under these circumstances was
not Lady Macleod right in saying that George Vavasor should not have
been accepted as a companion for the Swiss tour?

<p/>The little dinner-party went off very quietly; and if no other ground
existed for charging Mr. Grey with London dissipation than what that
afforded, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was accused most unjustly. The two young men had never
before met each other; and Vavasor had gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) uncle's house,
prepared not only to dislike but to despise his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) successor in Alice's
favour. But in this he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was either disappointed or gratified, as the
case may be. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has plenty to say for himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) said to Kate on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) way home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) can talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) doesn't talk like a prig either, which was what I expected.
He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'s uncommonly handsome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought men never saw that in each other. I never see it in any
man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see it in every animal--in men, women, horses, dogs, and even
pigs. I like to look on handsome things. I think people always do who
are ugly themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so you're going into raptures in favour of John Grey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm not. I very seldom go into raptures about anything. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
talks in the way I like a man to talk. How he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) bowled my uncle over
about those actors; and yet if my uncle knows anything about anything
it is about the stage twenty years ago.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>There was nothing more said
then about John Grey; but Kate understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother well enough to
be aware that this praise meant very little. George Vavasor spoke
sometimes from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) heart, and did so more frequently to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) sister
than to any one else; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) words came generally from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) head.

<p/>On the day after the little dinner in Queen Anne Street, John Grey
came to say good-bye to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) betrothed;--for his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) betrothed she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)
certainly was, in spite of those very poor arguments which she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) had
used in trying to convince herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) was still free if she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)
wished to claim her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) freedom. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had been constantly with Alice
during the last three days, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had not hitherto said anything as to
the day of their marriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had been constantly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) alone,
sitting for hours in that ugly green drawing-room, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had never
touched the subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) much of Switzerland, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had never yet seen but which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) knew well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) much of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) garden and house, whither she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had once gone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father,
whilst paying a visit nominally to the colleges at Cambridge. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
had talked of various matters, matters bearing in no immediate way
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) own or her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) affairs; for Mr. Grey was a man who knew well how
to make words pleasant; but previous to this last moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had said
nothing on that subject on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was so intent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) said, when the last hour had come, <div class="bookquote">``and about that
question of home affairs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us finish off the foreign affairs first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have finished them; haven't we?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Finished them! why we haven't started yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; you haven't started. But we've had the discussion. Is there any
reason why you'd rather not have this thing settled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; no special reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why not let it be fixed? Do you fear coming to me as my wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot think that you repent your goodness to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I don't repent it;--what you call my goodness? I love you too
entirely for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My darling!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) waist as they stood
near the empty fireplace. <div class="bookquote">``And if you love me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why should you not wish to come to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do wish it. I think I wish it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Alice, you must have wished it altogether when you consented to
be my wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A person may wish for a thing altogether, and yet not wish for it
instantly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Instantly! Come; I have not been hard on you. This is still June.
Will you say the middle of September, and we shall still be in time
for warm pleasant days among the lakes? Is that asking for too much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not asking for anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, but it is, love. Grant it, and I will swear that you have
granted me everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was silent, having things to say but not knowing in what words to
put them. Now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not say the things which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had told herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would utter to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not bring
herself to hint to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) views of life were so unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own,
that there could be no chance of happiness between them, unless each
could strive to lean somewhat towards the other. No man could be more
gracious in word and manner than John Grey; no man more chivalrous in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) carriage towards a woman; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) always spoke and acted as though
there could be no question that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) manner of life was to be adopted,
without a word or thought of doubting, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) wife. When two came
together, why should not each yield something, and each claim
something? This she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had meant to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) on this day; but now that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could not say it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``John,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``do not press me about this till I return.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But then you will say the time is short. It would be short then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, I hope never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) did not press her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) further then, but kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and bade her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
farewell.




<p/>CHAPTER IV.

<p/>George Vavasor, the Wild Man.


<p/>It will no doubt be understood that George Vavasor did not roam about
in the woods unshorn, or wear leathern trappings and sandals, like
Robinson Crusoe, instead of coats and trousers. His (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) wildness was of
another kind. Indeed, I don't know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) was in truth at all wild,
though Lady Macleod had called him (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) so, and Alice had assented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
use of the word.

<p/>George Vavasor had lived in London since he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was twenty, and now, at
the time of the beginning of my story, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was a year or two over
thirty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was and ever had been the heir to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) grandfather's
estate; but that estate was small, and when George first came to
London his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father was a strong man of forty, with as much promise
of life in him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) son had. A profession had therefore been
absolutely necessary to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had, at his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) uncle John's
instance, been placed in the office of a parliamentary land agent.
With this parliamentary land agent he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) had quarrelled to the knife,
but not before he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) had by his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) talents made himself so useful that
he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) had before him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) the prospects of a lucrative partnership in the
business. George Vavasor had many faults, but idleness--absolute
idleness--was not one of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would occasionally postpone his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
work to pleasure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would be at Newmarket when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) should have been
at Whitehall. But it was not usual with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) to be in bed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
should be at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) desk, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) desk he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) did not whittle
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) ruler, or pick his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) teeth, or clip his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) nails. Upon the whole
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) friends were pleased with the first five years of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) life in
London--in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) having been found to be in debt on more than
one occasion. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) debts had been paid; and all was going on
swimmingly, when one day he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) knocked down the parliamentary agent
with a blow between the eyes, and then there was an end of that.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) himself was wont to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had known very well what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was
about, that it had behoved him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) to knock down the man who was to have
been his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) partner, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) regretted nothing in the matter. At any
rate the deed was looked upon with approving eyes by many men of good
standing,--or, at any rate, sufficient standing to help George to
another position; and within six weeks of the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) leaving the
office at Whitehall, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had become a partner in an established firm
of wine merchants. A great-aunt had just then left him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) a couple of
thousand pounds, which no doubt assisted him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) views with the
wine merchants.

<p/>In this employment he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) remained for another period of five years, and
was supposed by all his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) friends to be doing very well. And indeed
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did not do badly, only that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did not do well enough to satisfy
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was ambitious of making the house to which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) belonged
the first house in the trade in London, and scared his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) partners by
the boldness and extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) views. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) himself declared that if
they would only have gone along with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would have made them
princes in the wine market. But they were men either of more prudence
or of less audacity than he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and they declined to walk in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
courses. At the end of the five years Vavasor left the house, not
having knocked any one down on this occasion, and taking with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) a
very nice sum of money.

<p/>The two last of these five years had certainly been the best period
of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) life, for he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had really worked very hard, like a man, giving
up all pleasure that took time from him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>),--and giving up also most
pleasures which were dangerous on account of their costliness. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
went to no races, played no billiards, and spoke of Cremorne as a
childish thing, which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had abandoned now that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was no longer
a child. It was during these two years that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had had his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) love
passages with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cousin; and it must be presumed that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had, at any
rate, intended at one time to settle himself respectably as a married
man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had, however, behaved very badly to Alice, and the match had
been broken off.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had also during the last two years quarrelled with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
grandfather. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had wished to raise a sum of money on the Vavasor
estate, which, as it was unentailed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could only do with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
grandfather's concurrence. The old gentleman would not hear of
it,--would listen with no patience to the proposition. It was in
vain that George attempted to make the squire understand that the
wine business was going on very well, that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) himself owed no man
anything, that everything with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was flourishing;--but that his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
trade might be extended indefinitely by the use of a few thousand
pounds at moderate interest. Old Mr. Vavasor was furious. No documents
and no assurances could make him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) lay aside a belief that the wine
merchants, and the business, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) grandson were all ruined and
ruinous together. No one but a ruined man would attempt to raise
money on the family estate! So they had quarrelled, and had never
spoken or seen each other since. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) shall have the estate for his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
life,''  (<font color='red'><b>the squire</b></font>)</div>the squire said to his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) son John. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I have a right
to leave it away from him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). It never has been left away from the heir.
But I'll tie it up so that he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) shan't cut a tree on it.''  (<font color='red'><b>John Vavasor/Mr. John Vavasor/Mr. Vavasor</b></font>)</div>John Vavasor
perhaps thought that the old rule of primogeniture might under such
circumstances have been judiciously abandoned--in this one instance,
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) own favour. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) did not say so. Nor would he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) have said it
had there been a chance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) doing so with success. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was a man
from whom no very noble deed could be expected; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was also one
who would do no ignoble deed.

<p/>After that George Vavasor had become a stockbroker, and a stockbroker
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was now. In the first twelve months after his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) leaving the wine
business,--the same being the first year after his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) breach with
Alice,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had gone back greatly in the estimation of men. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had
lived in open defiance of decency. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had spent much money and had
apparently made none, and had been, as all his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) friends declared, on
the high road to ruin. Aunt Macleod had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) judgement from this
period of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) life when she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had spoken of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) as a man who never did
anything. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come forth again suddenly as a working man; and
now they who professed to know, declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was by no means
poor. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in the City every day; and during the last two years had
earned the character of a shrewd fellow who knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was about,
who might not perhaps be very mealy-mouthed in affairs of business,
but who was fairly and decently honourable in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) money transactions.
In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) stood well on ``Change.

<p/>And during these two years he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) had stood a contest for a seat in
Parliament, having striven to represent the metropolitan borough of
Chelsea, on the extremely Radical interest. It is true that he (<font color='blue'><b>Radical</b></font>) had
failed, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Radical</b></font>) had spent a considerable sum of money in the
contest. <div class="bookquote">``Where on earth does your nephew get his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) money?''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>men said to
John Vavasor at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) club. <div class="bookquote">``Upon my word I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) doesn't get it from me, and I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) doesn't get it from my
father.''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>But George Vavasor, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) failed at Chelsea, did not
spend his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) money altogether fruitlessly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) gained reputation by the
struggle, and men came to speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) were one who
would do something. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was a stockbroker, a thorough-going Radical,
and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Radical</b></font>) was the heir to a fine estate, which had come down from
father to son for four hundred years! There was something captivating
about his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) history and adventures, especially as just at the time of
the election he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) became engaged to an heiress, who died a month before
the marriage should have taken place. She (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) died without a will, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) money all went to some third cousins.

<p/>George Vavasor bore this last disappointment like a man, and it was
at this time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) again became fully reconciled to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) cousin.
Previous to this they had met; and Alice, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin Kate's
instigation, had induced her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). But at first there
had been no renewal of real friendship. Alice had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cordial
assent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin's marriage with the heiress, Miss Grant, telling
Kate that such an engagement was the very thing to put him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) thoroughly
on his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) feet. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had been much pleased by his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) spirit at that
Chelsea election. <div class="bookquote">``It was grand of him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>), wasn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
eyes brimming full of tears. <div class="bookquote">``It was very spirited,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``If
you knew all, you would say so. They could get no one else to stand
but that Mr. Travers, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Travers</b></font>) wouldn't come forward, unless they would
guarantee all his (<font color='blue'><b>Travers</b></font>) expenses.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I hope it didn't cost George much,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``It did, though; nearly all he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had got. But what matters?
Money's nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), except for its uses. My own little mite is
my own now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) shall have every farthing of it for the next
election, even though I should go out as a housemaid the next day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>There must have been something great about George Vavasor, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
would not have been so idolized by such a girl as his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) sister Kate.

<p/>Early in the present spring, before the arrangements for the Swiss
journey were made, George Vavasor had spoken to Alice about that
intended marriage which had been broken off by the lady's death. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
was sitting one evening with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) cousin in the drawing-room in Queen
Anne Street, waiting for Kate, who was to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) there before going
to some party. I wonder whether Kate had had a hint from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother
to be late! At any rate, the two were together for an hour, and the
talk had been all about himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had congratulated her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
engagement with Mr. Grey, which had just become known to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), and had
then spoken of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) own last intended marriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I grieved for her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``greatly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you did, George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did;--for her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>), herself. Of course the world has given me
credit for lamenting the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) money. But the truth is, that as
regards both herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) money, it is much better for me that we
were never married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean even though she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) should have lived?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--even had she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) lived.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why so? If you liked her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) money was surely no drawback.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not if I had liked her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And did you not like her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, George!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not love her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) as a man should love his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, if you mean that.
As for my liking her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), I did like her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). I liked her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you would have loved her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I don't find that task of loving so very easy. It
might have been that I should have learned to hate her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If so, it is better for you, and better for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is better. I am sure of it. And yet I grieve for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and in

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) never suspected that you did not love her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no. But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was not given to think much of such things. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) took
all that for granted. Poor girl! she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is at rest now, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) money
has gone, where it should go, among her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own relatives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; with such feelings as yours are about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) money would have
been a burden to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would not have taken it. I hope, at least, that I would not have
taken it. Money is a sore temptation, especially to a poor man like
me. It is well for me that the trial did not come in my way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are not such a very poor man now, are you, George? I thought
your business was a good one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is, and I have no right to be a poor man. But a man will be poor
who does such mad things as I do. I had three or four thousand pounds
clear, and I spent every shilling of it on the Chelsea election.
Goodness knows whether I shall have a shilling at all when another
chance comes round; but if I have I shall certainly spend it, and
if I have not, I shall go in debt wherever I can raise a hundred
pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you will be successful at last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel sure that I shall. But, in the mean time, I cannot but know
that my career is perfectly reckless. No woman ought to join her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lot
to mine unless she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has within her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) courage to be as reckless as I am.
You know what men do when they toss up for shillings?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I suppose I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am tossing up every day of my life for every shilling that I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I have given that up altogether. I used to gamble, but I never
do that now, and never shall again. What I mean is this,--that I hold
myself in readiness to risk everything at any moment, in order to
gain any object that may serve my turn. I am always ready to lead a
forlorn hope. That's what I mean by tossing up every day for every
shilling that I have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice did not quite understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), and perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) did not intend
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should. Perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) object was to mystify her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) imagination.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), but I fear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) admired the kind of
courage which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) professed. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had not only professed it: in that
matter of the past election he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had certainly practised it.

<p/>In talking of beauty to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) sister he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had spoken of himself as being
ugly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would not generally have been called ugly by women, had not
one side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) face been dreadfully scarred by a cicatrice, which in
healing, had left a dark indented line down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) left eye to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
lower jaw. That black ravine running through his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) cheek was certainly
ugly. On some occasions, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was angry or disappointed, it was
very hideous; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would so contort his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) face that the scar would,
as it were, stretch itself out, revealing all its horrors, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
countenance would become all scar. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked at me like the devil
himself--making the hole in his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) face gape at me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the squire</b></font>)</div>the old squire
had said to John Vavasor in describing the interview in which the
grandson had tried to bully his (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) grandfather into assenting to his (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) own
views about the mortgage. But in other respects George's face was not
ugly, and might have been thought handsome by many women. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hair
was black, and was parted in the front. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) forehead, though low,
was broad. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eyes were dark and bright, and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eyebrows were very
full, and perfectly black. At those periods of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) anger, all his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
face which was not scar, was eye and eyebrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wore a thick black
moustache, which covered his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mouth, but no whiskers. People said of
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was so proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wound that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would not grow a hair
to cover it. The fact, however, was that no whisker could be made to
come sufficiently forward to be of service, and therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wore
none.

<p/>The story of that wound should be told. When he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was yet hardly more
than a boy, before he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had come up to London, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was living in a
house in the country which his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father then occupied. At the time
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father was absent, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sister only were in the house
with the maid-servants. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sister had a few jewels in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) room, and
an exaggerated report of them having come to the ears of certain
enterprising burglars, a little plan was arranged for obtaining them.
A small boy was hidden in the house, a window was opened, and at the
proper witching hour of night a stout individual crept up-stairs in
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stocking-feet, and was already at Kate Vavasor's door,--when,
in the dark, dressed only in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) nightshirt, wholly unarmed, George
Vavasor flew at the fellow's throat. Two hours elapsed before the
horror-stricken women of the house could bring men to the place.
George's face had then been ripped open from the eye downwards, with
some chisel, or house-breaking instrument. But the man was dead.
George had wrenched from him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own tool, and having first jabbed
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) all over with insufficient wounds, had at last driven the steel
through his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) windpipe. The small boy escaped, carrying with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) two
shillings and threepence which Kate had left upon the drawing-room
mantelpiece.

<p/>George Vavasor was rather low in stature, but well made, with small
hands and feet, but broad in the chest and strong in the loins. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
was a fine horseman and a hard rider; and men who had known him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) well
said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) could fence and shoot with a pistol as few men care to
do in these peaceable days. Since volunteering had come up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had
become a captain of Volunteers, and had won prizes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) rifle at
Wimbledon.

<p/>Such had been the life of George Vavasor, and such was his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) character,
and such his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) appearance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had always lived alone in London, and did
so at present; but just now his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) sister was much with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was
staying up in town with an aunt, another Vavasor by birth, with whom
the reader will, if he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) persevere, become acquainted in course of
time. I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) will persevere a little, for of all the Vavasors Mrs.
Greenow was perhaps the best worth knowing. But Kate Vavasor's home
was understood to be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) grandfather's house in Westmoreland.

<p/>On the evening before they started for Switzerland, George and Kate
walked from Queen Anne Street, where they had been dining with Alice,
to Mrs. Greenow's house. Everything had been settled about luggage,
hours of starting, and routes as regarded their few first days;
and the common purse had been made over to George. That portion of
Mr. Grey's letter had been read which alluded to the Paynims and
the glasses of water, and everything had passed in the best of
good-humour. <div class="bookquote">``I'll endeavour to get the cold water for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>George
had said; <div class="bookquote">``but as to the breakfasts, I can only hope you won't put
me to severe trials by any very early hours. When people go out for
pleasure it should be pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>The brother and sister walked through two or three streets in
silence, and then Kate asked a question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George, I wonder what your wishes really are about Alice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) shouldn't want her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) breakfast too early while we are away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That means that I'm to hold my tongue, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it doesn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it means that you intend to hold yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not that either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what does it mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I have no fixed wishes on the subject. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'ll marry
this man John Grey, and then no one will hear another word about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) will no doubt, if you don't interfere. Probably she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) will whether
you interfere or not. But if you wish to interfere--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'s got four hundred a year, and is not so good-looking as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) has got four hundred a year, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is more handsome now
than ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was. I know that you think so;--and that you love her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
and love no one else--unless you have a sneaking fondness for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll leave you to judge of that last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And as for me,--I only love two people in the world; her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) and you. If
ever you mean to try, you should try now.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER V.

<p/>The Balcony at Basle.


<p/>I am not going to describe the Vavasors' Swiss tour. It would not be
fair on my readers. <div class="bookquote">``Six Weeks in the Bernese Oberland, by party of
three,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>would have but very small chance of success in the literary
world at present, and I should consider myself to be dishonest if
I attempt to palm off such matter on the public in the pages of a
novel. It is true that I have just returned from Switzerland, and
should find such a course of writing very convenient. But I dismiss
the temptation, strong as it is. _Retro age, Satanas._ No living man
or woman any longer wants to be told anything of the Grimsell or
of the Gemmi. Ludgate Hill is now-a-days more interesting than the
Jungfrau.

<p/>The Vavasors were not very energetic on their tour. As George had
said, they had gone out for pleasure and not for work. They went
direct to Interlaken and then hung about between that place and
Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen, It delighted him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to sit still on some
outer bench, looking at the mountains, with a cigar in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mouth,
and it seemed to delight them to be with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). Much that Mr. Grey
prophesied had come true. The two girls were ministers to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>),
instead of having him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) as their slave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What fine fellows those Alpine club men think themselves,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) said
on one of these occasions, <div class="bookquote">``and how thoroughly they despise the sort
of enjoyment I get from mountains. But they're mistaken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see why either need be mistaken,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But they are mistaken,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``They rob the mountains of
their poetry, which is or should be their greatest charm. Mont Blanc
can have no mystery for a man who has been up it half a dozen times.
It's like getting behind the scenes at a ballet, or making a conjuror
explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) tricks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But is the exercise nothing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; the exercise is very fine;--but that avoids the question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And they all botanize,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it. I believe that the most of them simply walk
up the mountain and down again. But if they did, that avoids the
question also. The poetry and mystery of the mountains are lost to
those who make themselves familiar with their details, not the less
because such familiarity may have useful results. In this world
things are beautiful only because they are not quite seen, or not
perfectly understood. Poetry is precious chiefly because it suggests
more than it declares. Look in there, through that valley, where you
just see the distant little peak at the end. Are you not dreaming
of the unknown beautiful world that exists up there;--beautiful, as
heaven is beautiful, because you know nothing of the reality? If you
make your way up there and back to-morrow, and find out all about it,
do you mean to say that it will be as beautiful to you when you come
back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--I think it would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you've no poetry in you. Now I'm made up of poetry.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>After that
they began to laugh at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) and were very happy.

<p/>I think that Mr. Grey was right in answering Alice's letter as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) did;
but I think that Lady Macleod was also right in saying that Alice
should not have gone to Switzerland in company with George Vavasor. A
peculiar familiarity sprang up, which, had all its circumstances been
known to Mr. Grey, would not have entirely satisfied him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), even though
no word was said which might in itself have displeased him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). During
the first weeks of their travelling no word was said which would
have displeased him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>); but at last, when the time for their return was
drawing nigh, when their happiness was nearly over, and that feeling
of melancholy was coming on them which always pervades the last hours
of any period that has been pleasant,--then words became softer than
they had been, and references were made to old days,--allusions which
never should have been permitted between them.

<p/>Alice had been very happy,--more happy perhaps in that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been
a joint minister with Kate to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cousin George's idle fantasies,
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would have been hurrying about with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) slave. They
had tacitly agreed to spoil him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) with comforts; and girls are always
happier in spoiling some man than in being spoiled by men. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
taken it all well, doing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) despotism pleasantly, exacting much,
but exacting nothing that was disagreeable. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been amusing
always, as Alice thought without any effort. But men and women, when
they show themselves at their best, seldom do so without an effort.
If the object be near the heart the effort will be pleasant to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
who makes it, and if it be made well, it will be hidden; but, not the
less, will the effort be there. George Vavasor had on the present
occasion done his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) very best to please his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) cousin.

<p/>They were sitting at Basle one evening in the balcony of the big
hotel which overlooks the Rhine. The balcony runs the length of the
house, and is open to all the company; but it is spacious, and little
parties can be formed there with perfect privacy. The swift broad
Rhine runs underneath, rushing through from the bridge which here
spans the river; and every now and then on summer evenings loud
shouts come up from strong swimmers in the water, who are glorying
in the swiftness of the current. The three were sitting there, by
themselves, at the end of the balcony. Coffee was before them on a
little table, and George's cigar, as usual, was in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's nearly all over,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), after they had remained silent for
some minutes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I do think it has been a success,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate. <div class="bookquote">``Always excepting
about the money. I'm ruined for ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll make your money all straight,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed you'll do nothing of the kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate. <div class="bookquote">``I'm ruined, but
you are ruineder. But what signifies? It is such a great thing ever
to have had six weeks' happiness, that the ruin is, in point of fact,
a good speculation. What do you say, Alice? Won't you vote, too, that
we've done it well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think we've done it very well. I have enjoyed myself thoroughly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now you've got to go home to John Grey and Cambridgeshire! It's
no wonder you should be melancholy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>That was the thought in Kate's
mind, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) did not speak it out on this occasion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's good of you, Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate. <div class="bookquote">``Is it not, George? I like a
person who will give a hearty meed of approbation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am giving the meed of approbation to myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like a person even to do that heartily,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate. <div class="bookquote">``Not that
George and I are thankful for the compliment. We are prepared to
admit that we owe almost everything to you,--are we not, George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not; by any means,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am, and I expect to have something pretty said to me in
return. Have I been cross once, Alice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I don't think you have. You are never cross, though you are
often ferocious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I haven't been once ferocious,--nor has George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would have been the most ungrateful man alive if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said
Alice. ``We've done nothing since we've started but realize from him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
that picture in <div class="bookquote">``Punch' of the young gentleman at Jeddo who had a
dozen ladies to wait upon him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has got to go home to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lodgings, and wait upon himself
again. Poor fellow! I do pity you, George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you don't;--nor does Alice. I believe girls always think that
a bachelor in London has the happiest of all lives. It's because
they think so that they generally want to put an end to the man's
condition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's envy that makes us want to get married,--not love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the devil in some shape, as often as not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``With a
man, marriage always seems to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be an evil at the instant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not always,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Almost always;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does it, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) takes physic, because
something worse will come if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) don't. A man never likes having his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
tooth pulled out, but all men do have their teeth pulled out,--and
they who delay it too long suffer the very mischief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do like George's philosophy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, getting up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) chair
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) spoke; <div class="bookquote">``it is so sharp, and has such a pleasant acid taste
about it; and then we all know that it means nothing. Alice, I'm
going up-stairs to begin the final packing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll come with you, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, don't. To tell the truth I'm only going into that man's room
because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't put up a single thing of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own decently. We'll
do ours, of course, when we go up to bed. Whatever you disarrange
to-night, Master George, you must rearrange for yourself to-morrow
morning, for I promise I won't go into your room at five o'clock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How I do hate that early work,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be down again very soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate. <div class="bookquote">``Then we'll take one turn
on the bridge and go to bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice and George were left together sitting in the balcony. They
had been alone together before many times since their travels had
commenced; but they both of them felt that there was something to
them in the present moment different from any other period of their
journey. There was something that each felt to be sweet, undefinable,
and dangerous. Alice had known that it would be better for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to go
up-stairs with Kate; but Kate's answer had been of such a nature that
had she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) gone she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would have shown that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had some special reason
for going. Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) show such a need? Or why, indeed, should
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) entertain it?

<p/>Alice was seated quite at the end of the gallery, and Kate's chair
was at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) feet in the corner. When Alice and Kate had seated
themselves, the waiter had brought a small table for the coffee-cups,
and George had placed his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) chair on the other side of that. So that
Alice was, as it were, a prisoner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not slip away without
some special preparation for going, and Kate had so placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) chair
in leaving, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) must actually have asked George to move it
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) could escape. But why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) wish to escape? Nothing
could be more lovely and enticing than the scene before her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). The
night had come on, with quick but still unperceived approach, as it
does in those parts; for the twilight there is not prolonged as it is
with us more northern folk. The night had come on, but there was a
rising moon, which just sufficed to give a sheen to the water beneath
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). The air was deliciously soft;--of that softness which produces
no sensation either of warmth or cold, but which just seems to touch
one with loving tenderness, as though the unseen spirits of the air
kissed one's forehead as they passed on their wings. The Rhine was
running at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) feet, so near, that in the soft half light it seemed
as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) might step into its ripple. The Rhine was running
by with that delicious sound of rapidly moving waters, that fresh
refreshing gurgle of the river, which is so delicious to the ear at
all times. If you be talking, it wraps up your speech, keeping it for
yourselves, making it difficult neither to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) who listens nor to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
who speaks. If you would sleep, it is of all lullabies the sweetest.
If you are alone and would think, it aids all your thoughts. If
you are alone, and, alas! would not think,--if thinking be too
painful,--it will dispel your sorrow, and give the comfort which
music alone can give. Alice felt that the air kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), that
the river sang for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) its sweetest song, that the moon shone for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) with its softest light,--that light which lends the poetry of
half-developed beauty to everything that it touches. Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
leave it?

<p/>Nothing was said for some minutes after Kate's departure, and Alice
was beginning to shake from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that half feeling of danger which had
come over her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). Vavasor had sat back in his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) chair, leaning against
the house, with his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) feet raised upon a stool; his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) arms were folded
across his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) breast, and he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) seemed to have divided himself between
his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) thoughts and his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) cigar. Alice was looking full upon the river,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thoughts had strayed away to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) future home among John
Grey's flower-beds and shrubs; but the river, though it sang to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
pleasantly, seemed to sing a song of other things than such a home as
that,--a song full of mystery, as are all river songs when one tries
to understand their words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When are you to be married, Alice?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, George!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You ask me a question as though you were
putting a pistol to my ear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry the question was so unpleasant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't say that it was unpleasant; but you asked it so suddenly!
The truth is, I didn't expect you to speak at all just then. I
suppose I was thinking of something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if it be not unpleasant,--when are you to be married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know. It is not fixed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But about when, I mean? This summer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not this summer, for the summer will be over when we reach
home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This winter? Next spring? Next year?--or in ten years' time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Before the expiration of the ten years, I suppose. Anything more
exact than that I can't say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you like it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) then said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, being married? You see I've never tried yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The idea of it,--the anticipation, You look forward with
satisfaction to the kind of life you will lead at Nethercoats? Don't
suppose I am saying anything against it, for I have no conception
what sort of a place Nethercoats is. On the whole I don't know that
there is any kind of life better than that of an English country
gentleman in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own place;--that is, if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) can keep it up, and not
live as the old squire does, in a state of chronic poverty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Grey's place doesn't entitle him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) to be called a country
gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you like the prospect of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, George, how you do cross-question one! Of course I like it, or
I shouldn't have accepted it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That does not follow. But I quite acknowledge that I have no right
to cross-question you. If I ever had such right on the score of
cousinship, I have lost it on the score of--; but we won't mind that,
will we, Alice?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>To this she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) at first made no answer, but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) repeated
the question. <div class="bookquote">``Will we, Alice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will we what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Recur to the old days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should we recur to them? They are passed, and as we are again
friends and dear cousins the sting of them is gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes! The sting of them is gone. It is for that reason, because
it is so, that we may at last recur to them without danger. If we
regret nothing,--if neither of us has anything to regret, why not
recur to them, and talk of them freely?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, George; that would not do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By heavens, no! It would drive me mad; and if I know aught of you,
it would hardly leave you as calm as you are at present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As I would wish to be left calm--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you? Then I suppose I ought to hold my tongue. But, Alice, I
shall never have the power of speaking to you again as I speak now.
Since we have been out together, we have been dear friends; is it not
so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And shall we not always be dear friends?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, certainly not. How will it be possible? Think of it. How can I
really be your friend when you are the mistress of that man's house
in Cambridgeshire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``George!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean nothing disrespectful. I truly beg your pardon if it
has seemed so. Let me say that gentleman's house;--for he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is a
gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) certainly is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You could not have accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) were he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) not so. But how can I be
your friend when you are his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife? I may still call you cousin Alice,
and pat your children on the head if I chance to see them; and shall
stop in the streets and shake hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) if I meet him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>);--that is
if my untoward fate does not induce him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to cut my acquaintance;--but
as for friendship, that will be over when you and I shall have parted
next Thursday evening at London Bridge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, George, don't say so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why on Thursday? Do you mean that you won't come to Queen Anne
Street any more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that is what I do mean. This trip of ours has been very
successful, Kate says. Perhaps Kate knows nothing about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been very pleasant,--at least to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the pleasure has had no drawback?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been very pleasant to me, also;--but the pleasure has had its
alloy. Alice, I have nothing to ask from you,--nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything that you should ask, I would do for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have nothing to ask;--nothing. But I have one word to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``George, do not say it. Let me go up-stairs. Let me go to Kate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly; if you wish it you shall go.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) still held his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) foot
against the chair which barred her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) passage, and did not attempt to
rise as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) must have done to make way for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) passage out. <div class="bookquote">``Certainly
you shall go to Kate, if you refuse to hear me. But after all
that has passed between us, after these six weeks of intimate
companionship, I think you ought to listen to me. I tell you that I
have nothing to ask. I am not going to make love to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice had commenced some attempt to rise, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had again settled
herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) chair. And now, when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) paused for a moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) made
no further sign that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wished to escape, nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) say a word to
intimate her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) further wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) should be silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not going to make love to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said again. <div class="bookquote">``As for making
love, as the word goes, that must be over between you and me. It has
been made and marred, and cannot be remade. It may exist, or it may
have been expelled; but where it does not exist, it will never be
brought back again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It should not be spoken of between you and me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So, no doubt, any proper-going duenna would say, and so, too, little
children should be told; but between you and me there can be no
necessity for falsehood. We have grown beyond our sugar-toothed ages,
and are now men and women. I perfectly understood your breaking away
from me. I understood you, and in spite of my sorrow knew that you
were right. I am not going to accuse or to defend myself; but I knew
that you were right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then let there be no more about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; there must be more about it. I did not understand you when you
accepted Mr. Grey. Against him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) I have not a whisper to make. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) may
be perfect for aught I know. But, knowing you as I thought I did, I
could not understand your loving such a man as him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It was as though
one who had lived on brandy should take himself suddenly to a milk
diet,--and enjoy the change! A milk diet is no doubt the best. But
men who have lived on brandy can't make those changes very suddenly.
They perish in the attempt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not always, George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It may be done with months of agony;--but there was no such agony
with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who can tell?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will tell me the cure was made. I thought so, and therefore
thought that I should find you changed. I thought that you, who had
been all fire, would now have turned yourself into soft-flowing milk
and honey, and have become fit for the life in store for you. With
such a one I might have travelled from Moscow to Malta without
danger. The woman fit to be John Grey's wife would certainly do
me no harm,--could not touch my happiness. I might have loved her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
once,--might still love the memory of what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been; but her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), in
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) new form, after her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) new birth,--such a one as that, Alice, could
be nothing to me. Don't mistake me. I have enough of wisdom in me to
know how much better, ay, and happier a woman she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might be. It was
not that I thought you had descended in the scale; but I gave you
credit for virtues which you have not acquired. Alice, that wholesome
diet of which I spoke is not your diet. You would starve on it, and
perish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had spoken with great energy, but still in a low voice, having
turned full round upon the table, with both his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arms upon it, and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
face stretched out far over towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was looking full at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>);
and, as I have said before, that scar and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) gloomy eyes and thick
eyebrows seemed to make up the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) face. But the scar had
never been ugly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew the story, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) lover
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had taken pride in the mark of the wound. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), but
though he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) paused she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not speak. The music of the river was still
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ears, and there came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) a struggle as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) were
striving to understand its song. Were the waters also telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) of
the mistake she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had made in accepting Mr. Grey as her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) husband? What
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin was now telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),--was it not a repetition of words
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had spoken to herself hundreds of times during the last
two months? Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) not telling herself daily,--hourly,--always,--in
every thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) life, that in accepting Mr. Grey she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had assumed
herself to be mistress of virtues which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not possess? Had
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) not, in truth, rioted upon brandy, till the innocence of milk
was unfitted for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)? This man now came and rudely told her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) all
this,--but did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) the truth? She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat silent and
convicted; only gazing into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face when his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speech was done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have learned this since we have been again together, Alice; and
finding you, not the angel I had supposed, finding you to be the same
woman I had once loved,--the safety that I anticipated has not fallen
to my lot. That's all. Here's Kate, and now we'll go for our walk.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER VI.

<p/>The Bridge over the Rhine.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, speaking before she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) quite got up to them, <div class="bookquote">``will
you tell me whether you have been preparing all your things for an
open sale by auction?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) stole a look at Alice, and having
learned from that glance that something had occurred which prevented
Alice from joining her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) raillery, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on with it herself
rapidly, as though to cover Alice's confusion, and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) time to
rally before they should all move. <div class="bookquote">``Would you believe it? he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had
three razors laid out on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) table--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A man must shave,--even at Basle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But not with three razors at once; and three hair-brushes, and
half a dozen toothbrushes, and a small collection of combs, and
four or five little glass bottles, looking as though they contained
poison,--all with silver tops. I can only suppose you desired to
startle the weak mind of the chambermaid. I have put them all up; but
remember this, if they are taken out again you are responsible. And
I will not put up your boots, George. What can you have wanted with
three pairs of boots at Basle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When you have completed the list of my wardrobe we'll go out upon
the bridge. That is, if Alice likes it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes; I shall like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate. And so they moved away. When they got
upon the bridge Alice and Kate were together, while George strolled
behind them, close to them, but not taking any part in their
conversation,--as though he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had merely gone with them as an escort.
Kate seemed to be perfectly content with this arrangement, chattering
to Alice, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might show that there was nothing serious on
the minds of any of them. It need hardly be said that Alice at this
time made no appeal to George to join them. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) followed them at their
heels, with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hands behind his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) back, looking down upon the pavement

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, <div class="bookquote">``I have a very great mind to run away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--that wouldn't much signify. Perhaps I'd go to the little inn
at Handek. It's a lonely place, where nobody would hear of me,--and I
should have the waterfall. I'm afraid they'd want to have their bill
paid. That would be the worst of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why run away just now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't, because you wouldn't like going home with George
alone,--and I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'d be bound to look after me, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'s doing
now. I wonder what he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thinks of having to walk over the bridge after
us girls. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'d be in that place down there drinking beer,
if we weren't here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wanted to go, I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would, in spite of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's ungrateful of you, for I'm sure we've never been kept in a
moment by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) failing us. But as I was saying, I do dread going home.
You are going to John Grey, which may be pleasant enough; but I'm
going--to Aunt Greenow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's your own choice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it's not. I haven't any choice in the matter. Of course I might

practically I haven't any choice in the matter. Fancy a month at
Yarmouth with no companion but such a woman as that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't mind it. Aunt Greenow always seems to me to be a very
good sort of woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may be a good woman, but I must say I think she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s of a bad sort.
You've never heard her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) talk about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, never; I think she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did cry a little the first day she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came to
Queen Anne Street, but that wasn't unnatural.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was thirty years older than herself.''

what of that? What's a woman to do? Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was wrong to marry
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was thirty-five, and had nothing, while he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was sixty-five,
and was very rich. According to all accounts she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) a very good
wife, and now that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s got all his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) money, you wouldn't have her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) go
about laughing within three months of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I wouldn't have her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) laugh; but neither would I have her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cry.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s quite right to wear weeds; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) needn't be so very
outrageous in the depth of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hems, or so very careful that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) caps
are becoming. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes will be worn out by their double service. They
are always red with weeping, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is ready every minute with a
full battery of execution for any man that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sees.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why have you consented to go to Yarmouth with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s got forty thousand pounds. If Mr. Greenow had left

Does anybody ever drop their rich relatives? When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) proposed to
take me to Yarmouth, wasn't it natural that the squire should ask me
to go? When I told George, wasn't it natural that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) should say, ``Oh,
go by all means. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s got forty thousand pounds!<div class="bookquote">'' One can't pretend

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, I should say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a halfpenny. I'm nearly thirty and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s only forty, and of

living cares less for money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think no one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet one sticks to one's rich relatives. It's the way of the world.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) paused a moment. <div class="bookquote">``But shall I tell you, Alice, why I do
stick to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)? Perhaps you'll think the object as mean as though I
wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) money myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it is on the cards that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) may help George in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) career. I
do not want money, but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) may. And for such purposes as his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), I think
it fair that all the family should contribute. I feel sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
would make a name for himself in Parliament; and if I had my way I
would spend every shilling of Vavasor money in putting him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) there.
When I told the squire so I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) would have eaten me. I really
did think he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) would have turned me out of the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And serve you right too after what had happened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't care. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) turn me out. I was determined he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) should know
what I thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) swore at me; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) was so unhappy at what
he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) had done that he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) came and kissed me that night in my bedroom, and
gave me a ten-pound note. What do you think I did with it? I sent it
as a contribution to the next election and George has it now locked
up in a box. Don't you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) that I told you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then they stopped and leaned for a while over the parapet of the
bridge. <div class="bookquote">``Come here, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) made room for him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
between herself and Alice. <div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't you like to be swimming down
there as those boys were doing when we went out into the balcony? The
water looks so enticing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say I should;--unless it might be a pleasant way of swimming
into the next world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should so like to feel myself going with the stream,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate;
<div class="bookquote">``particularly by this light. I can't fancy in the least that I should
be drowned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't fancy anything else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be so pleasant to feel the water gliding along one's limbs,
and to be carried away headlong,--knowing that you were on the direct
road to Rotterdam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so arrive there without your clothes,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They would be brought after in a boat. Didn't you see that those
boys had a boat with them? But if I lived here, I'd never do it
except by moonlight. The water looks so clear and bright now, and the
rushing sound of it is so soft! The sea at Yarmouth won't be anything
like that I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Neither of them any longer answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on talking
about the river, and their aunt, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) prospects at Yarmouth.
Neither of them answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and yet it seemed that they had not a
word to say to each other. But still they stood there looking down
upon the river, and every now and then Kate's voice was to be heard,
preventing the feeling which might otherwise have arisen that their
hearts were too full for speech.

<p/>At last Alice seemed to shiver. There was a slight trembling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
arms, which George felt rather than saw. <div class="bookquote">``You are cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are let us go in. I thought you shivered with the night air.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It wasn't that. I was thinking of something. Don't you ever think of
things that make you shiver?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I do, very often;--so often that I have to do my shiverings
inwardly. Otherwise people would think I had the palsy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean things of moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``Little bits of things
make me do it;--perhaps a word that I said and ought not to have said
ten years ago;--the most ordinary little mistakes, even my own past
thoughts to myself about the merest trifles. They are always making
me shiver.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not because you have committed any murder then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but it's my conscience all the same, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I'm not so good as you. I doubt it's not my conscience at all.
When I think of a chance I've let go by, as I have thousands, then it
is that I shiver. But, as I tell you, I shiver inwardly. I've been in
one long shiver ever since we came out because of one chance that I
let go by. Come, we'll go in. We've to be up at five o'clock, and now
it's eleven. I'll do the rest of my shivering in bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you tired of being out?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, when the other two began to
move.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not tired of being out, but George reminds me that we have to be up
at five.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish George would hold his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) tongue. We can't come to the bridge
at Basle every night in our lives. If one found oneself at the top
of Sinai I'm afraid the first feeling would be one of fear lest one
wouldn't be down in time to dress for dinner. Are you aware, George,
that the king of rivers is running beneath your feet, and that the
moon is shining with a brilliance you never see at home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll stay here all night if you'll put off going to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said
George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our money wouldn't hold out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk about Sinai any more after that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but let's go
in to bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked across the bridge back to the hotel in the same manner as
before, the two girls going together with the young man after them,
and so they went up the front steps of the hotel, through the hall,
and on to the stairs. Here George handed Alice her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) candle, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
did so he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) whispered a few words to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``My shivering fit has to come
yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and will last me the whole night.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would have
given much to be able to answer him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lightly, as though what he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had
said had meant nothing;--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) couldn't do it; the light speech
would not come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was conscious of all this, and went away
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own room without answering him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) at all. Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat down at
the window looking out upon the river till Kate should join her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>).
Their rooms opened through from one to the other, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would not
begin her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) packing till her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cousin should come.

<p/>But Kate had gone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother, promising, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) did so, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would be back in half a minute. That half minute was protracted
beyond half an hour. <div class="bookquote">``If you'll take my advice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, at last,
standing up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) candle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``you'll ask her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in plain
words to give you another chance. Do it to-morrow at Strasbourg;
you'll never have a better opportunity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And bid her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) throw John Grey over!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say anything about John Grey; leave her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to settle that matter

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Kate, you women never understand each other. If I were to do that,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) has found that out long ago. Do you think I don't know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unless you should become his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife after all. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will never marry
anybody else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Kate, you shouldn't allude to such a thing now. You know that it's
impossible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, perhaps so. As far as I'm concerned, it is all the better
for me. If George ever married, I should have nothing to do in the
world;--literally nothing--nothing--nothing--nothing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Kate, don't talk in that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>and Alice came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) and embraced
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Go, Alice; you and I must part. I cannot bear
it any longer. You must know it all. When you are married to John
Grey, our friendship must be over. If you became George's wife I
should become nobody. I've nothing else in the world. You and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
would be so all-sufficient for each other, that I should drop away
from you like an old garment. But I'd give up all, everything, every
hope I have, to see you become George's wife. I know myself not to
be good. I know myself to be very bad, and yet I care nothing for
myself. Don't Alice, don't; I don't want your caresses. Caress him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>),
and I'll kneel at your feet and cover them with kisses.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had now
thrown herself upon a sofa, and had turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face away to the wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kate, you shouldn't speak in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I shouldn't,--but I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You, who know everything, must know that I cannot marry your
brother,--even if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wished it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) does wish it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not though I were under no other engagement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, again starting up. <div class="bookquote">``What is there to
separate you from George now, but that unfortunate affair, that will
end in the misery of you all. Do you think I can't see? Don't I know
which of the two men you like best?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are making me sorry, Kate, that I have ventured to come here in
your brother's company. It is not only unkind of you to talk to me in
this way, but worse than that--it is indelicate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indelicate! How I do hate that word. If any word in the language
reminds me of a whited sepulchre it is that;--all clean and polished
outside with filth and rottenness within. Are your thoughts delicate?
that's the thing. You are engaged to marry John Grey. That may be
delicate enough if you love him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) truly, and feel yourself fitted to be
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) wife; but it's about the most indelicate thing you can do, if you
love any one better than him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). Delicacy with many women is like their
cleanliness. Nothing can be nicer than the whole outside get-up, but
you wouldn't wish to answer for anything beneath.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you think ill of me like that--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I don't think ill of you. How can I think ill of you when I know
that all your difficulties have come from him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)? It hasn't been your
fault; it has been his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) throughout. It is he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) who has driven you to
sacrifice yourself on this altar. If we can, both of us, manage to
lay aside all delicacy and pretence, and dare to speak the truth,
we shall acknowledge that it is so. Had Mr. Grey come to you while
things were smooth between you and George, would you have thought it
possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could be George's rival in your estimation? It is
Hyperion to Satyr.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And which is the Satyr?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll leave your heart to tell you. You know what is the darling
wish of my heart. But, Alice, if I thought that Mr. Grey was to you
Hyperion,--if I thought that you could marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) with that sort of
worshipping, idolatrous love which makes a girl proud as well as
happy in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) marriage, I wouldn't raise a little finger to prevent
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>To this Alice made no answer, and then Kate allowed the matter to
drop. Alice made no answer, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was allowing
judgement to go against her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) by default in not doing so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
intended to fight bravely, and to have maintained the excellence
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) present position as the affianced bride of Mr. Grey, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had failed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had, in some sort,
acknowledged that the match was one to be deplored;--that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) words
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own defence would by no means have satisfied Mr. Grey, if Mr.
Grey could have heard them;--that they would have induced him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) to
offer her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) back her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) troth rather than have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) happy as a lover.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had nothing further to say. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could do something. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would
hurry home and bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) name the earliest day he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) pleased. After that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin would cease to disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) career.

<p/>It was nearly one o'clock before the two girls began to prepare for
their morning start, and Alice, when they had finished their packing,
seemed to be worn out with fatigue. <div class="bookquote">``If you are tired, dear, we'll
put it off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate. <div class="bookquote">``Not for worlds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``For half a
word we'll do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>continued Kate. <div class="bookquote">``I'll slip out to George and tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and there's nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'d like so much.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>But Alice would not
consent.

<p/>About two they got into bed, and punctually at six they were at the
railway station. <div class="bookquote">``Don't speak to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George, when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) met them
at their door in the passage. <div class="bookquote">``I shall only yawn in your face.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>However, they were in time,--which means abroad that they were at the
station half an hour before their train started,--and they went on
upon their journey to Strasbourg.

<p/>There is nothing further to be told of their tour. They were but two
days and nights on the road from Basle to London; and during those
two days and nights neither George nor Kate spoke a word to Alice of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) marriage, nor was any allusion made to the balcony at the inn, or
to the bridge over the river.




<p/>CHAPTER VII.

<p/>Aunt Greenow.


<p/>Kate Vavasor remained only three days in London before she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) started
for Yarmouth; and during those three days she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was not much with her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
cousin. <div class="bookquote">``I'm my aunt's, body and soul, for the next six weeks,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
said to Alice, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did come to Queen Anne Street on the morning
after her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) arrival. <div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is exigeant in a manner I can't at all
explain to you. You mustn't be surprised if I don't even write a
line. I've escaped by stealth now. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) went up-stairs to try on some
new weeds for the seaside, and then I bolted.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not say a
word about George; nor during those three days, nor for some days
afterwards, did George show himself. As it turned out afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
had gone off to Scotland, and had remained a week among the grouse.
Thus, at least, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had accounted for himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) movements; but
all George Vavasor's friends knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) goings out and comings in
were seldom accounted for openly like those of other men.

<p/>It will perhaps be as well to say a few words about Mrs. Greenow
before we go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) to Yarmouth. Mrs. Greenow was the only daughter
and the youngest child of the old squire at Vavasor Hall. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was
just ten years younger than her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) brother John, and I am inclined to
think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was almost justified in her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) repeated assertion that
the difference was much greater than ten years, by the freshness of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) colour, and by the general juvenility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) appearance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
certainly did not look forty, and who can expect a woman to proclaim
herself to be older than her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looks? In early life she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been taken
from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father's house, and had lived with relatives in one of the
large towns in the north of England. It is certain she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not been
quite successful as a girl. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had enjoyed the name of being
a beauty, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not the usual success which comes from such repute.
At thirty-four she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was still unmarried. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had, moreover, acquired
the character of being a flirt; and I fear that the stories which
were told of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), though doubtless more than half false, had in
them sufficient of truth to justify the character. Now this was
very sad, seeing that Arabella Vavasor had no fortune, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had offended her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father and brothers by declining to comply with
their advice at certain periods of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) career. There was, indeed,
considerable trouble in the minds of the various male Vavasors with
reference to Arabella, when tidings suddenly reached the Hall that
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was going to be married to an old man.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was married to the old man; and the marriage fortunately turned
out satisfactorily, at any rate for the old man and for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) family.
The Vavasors were relieved from all further trouble, and were as much
surprised as gratified when they heard that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) duty well
in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) new position. Arabella had long been a thorn in their side,
never having really done anything which they could pronounce to be
absolutely wrong, but always giving them cause for fear. Now they
feared no longer. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband was a retired merchant, very rich, not
very strong in health, and devoted to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bride. Rumours soon made
their way to Vavasor Hall, and to Queen Anne Street, that Mrs. Greenow
was quite a pattern wife, and that Mr. Greenow considered himself to
be the happiest old man in Lancashire. And now in her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) prosperity she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
quite forgave the former slights which had been put upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
relatives. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) dear niece Alice, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) dearest
niece Kate, and sent little presents to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) father. On one occasion
she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) husband to Vavasor Hall, and there was a regular renewal
of all the old family feelings. Arabella's husband was an old
man, and was very old for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) age; but the whole thing was quite
respectable, and there was, at any rate, no doubt about the money.
Then Mr. Greenow died; and the widow, having proved the will, came up
to London and claimed the commiseration of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) nieces.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not go to Yarmouth with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) for a month?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>George had said to
Kate. <div class="bookquote">``Of course it will be a bore. But an aunt with forty thousand
pounds has a right to claim attention.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>Kate acknowledged the truth
of the argument and agreed to go to Yarmouth for a month. <div class="bookquote">``Your aunt
Arabella has shown herself to be a very sensible woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>the squire</b></font>)</div>the old
squire had written; <div class="bookquote">``much more sensible than anybody thought her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) marriage. Of course you should go with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asks
you.''  (<font color='red'><b>the squire</b></font>)</div>What aunt, uncle, or cousin, in the uncontrolled possession of
forty thousand pounds was ever unpopular in the family?

<p/>Yarmouth is not a very prepossessing place to the eye. To my eye,
at any rate, it is not so. There is an old town with which summer
visitors have little or nothing to do; and there are the new houses
down by the sea-side, to which, at any rate, belongs the full
advantage of sea air. A kind of esplanade runs for nearly a mile
along the sands, and there are built, or in the course of building,
rows of houses appropriated to summer visitors all looking out upon
the sea. There is no beauty unless the yellow sandy sea can be called
beautiful. The coast is low and straight, and the east wind blows
full upon it. But the place is healthy; and Mrs. Greenow was probably
right in thinking that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) might there revive some portion of the
health which she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had lost in watching beside the couch of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
departing lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Omnibus;--no, indeed. Jeannette, get me a fly.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>These were the first
words Mrs. Greenow spoke as she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) foot upon the platform at the
Yarmouth station. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) maid's name was Jenny; but Kate had already
found, somewhat to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) dismay, that orders had been issued before
they left London that the girl was henceforth to be called Jeannette.
Kate had also already found that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt could be imperious; but
this taste for masterdom had not shown itself so plainly in London
as it did from the moment that the train had left the station at
Shoreditch. In London Mrs. Greenow had been among Londoners, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
career had hitherto been provincial. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) spirit, no doubt, had been
somewhat cowed by the novelty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) position. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) felt
herself to be once beyond the stones as the saying used to be, she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
was herself again; and at Ipswich she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had ordered Jeannette to get
her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) a glass of sherry with an air which had created a good deal of
attention among the guards and porters.

<p/>The fly was procured; and with considerable exertion all Mrs.
Greenow's boxes, together with the more moderate belongings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
niece and maid, were stowed on the top of it, round upon the driver's
body on the coach box, on the maid's lap, and I fear in Kate's also,
and upon the vacant seat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The large house in Montpelier Parade,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They is all large, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>said the driver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The largest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're much of a muchness,''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>said the driver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then Mrs. Jones's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow. <div class="bookquote">``But I was particularly told
it was the largest in the row.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know Mrs. Jones's well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>said the driver, and away they went.

<p/>Mrs. Jones's house was handsome and comfortable; but I fear Mrs.
Greenow's satisfaction in this respect was impaired by her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
disappointment in finding that it was not perceptibly bigger than
those to the right and left of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) ambition in this and in
other similar matters would have amused Kate greatly had she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) been
a bystander, and not one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt's party. Mrs. Greenow was
good-natured, liberal, and not by nature selfish; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was
determined not to waste the good things which fortune had given, and
desired that all the world should see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had forty thousand
pounds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) own. And in doing this she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was repressed by no
feeling of false shame. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) never hesitated in her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) demands through
bashfulness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) called aloud for such comfort and grandeur as
Yarmouth could afford her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), and was well pleased that all around
should hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) calling. Joined to all this was her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) uncontrolled
grief for her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) husband's death.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Greenow! sweet lamb! Oh, Kate, if you'd only known that man!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) said this she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was sitting in the best of Mrs. Jones's
sitting-rooms, waiting to have dinner announced. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) had taken a
drawing-room and dining-room, <div class="bookquote">``because,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) had said, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) didn't
see why people should be stuffy when they went to the seaside;--not
if they had means to make themselves comfortable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Kate, I do wish you'd known him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I had,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate,--very untruly. <div class="bookquote">``I was unfortunately away
when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went to Vavasor Hall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes; but it was at home, in the domestic circle, that Greenow
should have been seen to be appreciated. I was a happy woman,
Kate, while that lasted.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>And Kate was surprised to see that real
tears--one or two on each side--were making their way down her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
aunt's cheeks. But they were soon checked with a handkerchief of the
broadest hem and of the finest cambric.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dinner, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>said Jeannette, opening the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jeannette, I told you always to say that dinner was served.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dinner's served then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>said Jeannette in a tone of anger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Kate,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) aunt. <div class="bookquote">``I've but little appetite myself, but
there's no reason you shouldn't eat your dinner. I specially wrote to
Mrs. Jones to have some sweetbread. I do hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)'s got a decent cook.
It's very little I eat myself, but I do like to see things nice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The next day was Sunday; and it was beautiful to see how Mrs. Greenow
went to church in all the glory of widowhood. There had been a great
unpacking after that banquet on the sweetbread, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) funereal
millinery had been displayed before Kate's wondering eyes. The charm
of the woman was in this,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was not in the least ashamed of
anything that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) did. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) turned over all her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) wardrobe of mourning,
showing the richness of each article, the stiffness of the crape,
the fineness of the cambric, the breadth of the frills,--telling the
price of each to a shilling, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) explained how the whole had
been amassed without any consideration of expense. This she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) did with
all the pride of a young bride when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) shows the glories of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
trousseau to the friend of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) bosom. Jeannette stood by the while,
removing one thing and exhibiting another. Now and again through the
performance, Mrs. Greenow would rest a while from her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) employment, and
address the shade of the departed one in terms of most endearing
affection. In the midst of this Mrs. Jones came in; but the widow was
not a whit abashed by the presence of the stranger. <div class="bookquote">``Peace be to his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>)
manes!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) said at last, as she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) carefully folded up a huge black
crape mantilla. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) made, however, but one syllable of the classical
word, and Mrs. Jones thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) lodger had addressed herself to
the mortal <div class="bookquote">``remains''  (<font color='red'><b>lodger</b></font>)</div>of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) deceased lord.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``Peace be to his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) manes.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) is left her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) uncommon well off, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jones/Jones</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jones to

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may say that, ma'am. It's more nor a hundred thousand of

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pounds of sterling, ma'am! Indeed it is;--to my knowledge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) do;--but a lady can't bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) carriage down to the sea when

fly for church to-morrow, that'll look private, you know. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) said I
was to get a man that had a livery coat and gloves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man with the coat and gloves was procured; and Mrs. Greenow's
entry into church made quite a sensation. There was a thoughtfulness
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) which alone showed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was a woman of no ordinary
power. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) foresaw all necessities, and made provision for all
emergencies. Another would not have secured an eligible sitting, and
been at home in Yarmouth church, till half the period of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) sojourn
there was over. But Mrs. Greenow had done it all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) walked up the
middle aisle with as much self-possession as though the chancel had
belonged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) family for years; and the respectable pew-opener
absolutely deserted two or three old ladies whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was attending,
to show Mrs. Greenow into her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) seat. When seated, she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was the cynosure
of all eyes. Kate Vavasor became immediately aware that a great
sensation had been occasioned by their entrance, and equally aware
that none of it was due to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>). I regret to say that this feeling
continued to show itself throughout the whole service. How many
ladies of forty go to church without attracting the least attention!
But it is hardly too much to say that every person in that church had
looked at Mrs. Greenow. I doubt if there was present there a single
married lady who, on leaving the building, did not speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
husband of the widow. There had prevailed during the whole two hours
a general though unexpressed conviction that something worthy of
remark had happened that morning. It had an effect even upon the
curate's reading; and the incumbent, while preaching his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sermon,
could not keep his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyes off that wonderful bonnet and veil.

<p/>On the next morning, before eleven, Mrs. Greenow's name was put down
at the Assembly Room. <div class="bookquote">``I need hardly say that in my present condition
I care nothing for these things. Of course I would sooner be alone.
But, my dear Kate, I know what I owe to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Kate, with less intelligence than might have been expected from one
so clever, began to assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) required no society;
and that, coming thus with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) to the seaside in the early days of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) widowhood, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had been well aware that they would live retired.
But Mrs. Greenow soon put her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) down, and did so without the slightest
feeling of shame or annoyance on her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) own part. <div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``in this matter you must let me do what I know to be right. I should
consider myself to be very selfish if I allowed my grief to interfere
with your amusements.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, aunt, I don't care for such amusements.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's nonsense, my dear. You ought to care for them. How are you to
settle yourself in life if you don't care for them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear aunt, I am settled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Settled!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow, astounded, as though there must have
been some hidden marriage of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had not heard. <div class="bookquote">``But that's
nonsense. Of course you're not settled; and how are you to be, if I
allow you to shut yourself up in such a place as this,--just where a
girl has a chance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/>It was in vain that Kate tried to stop her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). It was not easy to stop
Mrs. Greenow when she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was supported by the full assurance of being
mistress of the place and of the occasion. <div class="bookquote">``No, my dear; I know very
well what I owe to you, and I shall do my duty. As I said before,
society can have no charms now for such a one as I am. All that
social intercourse could ever do for me lies buried in my darling's
grave. My heart is desolate, and must remain so. But I'm not going to
immolate you on the altars of my grief. I shall force myself to go
out for your sake, Kate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, dear aunt, the world will think it so odd, just at present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care twopence for the world. What can the world do to me?
I'm not dependent on the world,--thanks to the care of that sainted
lamb. I can hold my own; and as long as I can do that the world won't
hurt me. No, Kate, if I think a thing's right I shall do it. I mean
to make the place pleasant for you if I can, and the world may object
if it likes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Greenow was probably right in her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) appreciation of the value of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) independence. Remarks may perhaps have been made by the world of
Yarmouth as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) early return to society. People, no doubt, did
remind each other that old Greenow was hardly yet four months buried.
Mrs. Jones and Jeannette probably had their little jokes down-stairs.
But this did not hurt Mrs. Greenow. What was said, was not said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
hearing, Mrs. Jones's bills were paid every Saturday with admirable
punctuality; and as long as this was done everybody about the
house treated the lady with that deference which was due to the
respectability of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) possessions. When a recently bereaved widow
attempts to enjoy her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) freedom without money, then it behoves the
world to speak aloud;--and the world does its duty.

<p/>Numerous people came to call at Montpelier Parade, and Kate was
astonished to find that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt had so many friends. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was indeed
so bewildered by these strangers that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) could hardly ascertain whom
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt had really known before, and whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) now saw for the first
time. Somebody had known somebody who had known somebody else, and
that was allowed to be a sufficient introduction,--always presuming
that the existing somebody was backed by some known advantages of
money or position. Mrs. Greenow could smile from beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) widow's
cap in a most bewitching way. <div class="bookquote">``Upon my word then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) is really
handsome,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>Kate wrote one day to Alice. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) could also frown, and
knew well how to put aside, or, if need be, to reprobate any attempt
at familiarity from those whose worldly circumstances were supposed
to be disadvantageous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate one morning after their walk upon the pier,
<div class="bookquote">``how you did snub that Captain Bellfield!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain Bellfield, indeed! I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)'s a captain at all. At
any rate he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) has sold out, and the tradesmen have had a scramble for
the money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was only a lieutenant when the 97th were in Manchester,
and I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)'s never had a shilling to purchase since that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But everybody here seems to know him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps they do not know so much of him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) as I do. The idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
having the impudence to tell me I was looking very well! Nothing can
be so mean as men who go about in that way when they haven't money
enough in their pockets to pay their washerwomen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how do you know, aunt, that Captain Bellfield hasn't paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
washerwoman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know more than you think, my dear. It's my business. How could I
tell whose attentions you should receive and whose you shouldn't, if
I didn't inquire into these things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/>It was in vain that Kate rebelled, or attempted to rebel against this
more than maternal care. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was now nearly
thirty, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had managed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) own affairs, at any rate with
safety, for the last ten years;--but it was to no purpose. Kate would
get angry; but Mrs. Greenow never became angry. Kate would be quite
in earnest; but Mrs. Greenow would push aside all that her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) niece said
as though it were worth nothing. Kate was an unmarried woman with a
very small fortune, and therefore, of course, was desirous of being
married with as little delay as possible. It was natural that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
should deny that it was so, especially at this early date in their
mutual acquaintance. When the niece came to know her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) aunt more
intimately, there might be confidence between them, and then they
would do better. But Mrs. Greenow would spare neither herself nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
purse on Kate's behalf, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would be a dragon of watchfulness in
protecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) from the evil desires of such useless men as Captain
Bellfield.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I declare, Kate, I don't understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) said one morning to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) niece as they sat together over a late breakfast. They had fallen
into luxurious habits, and I am afraid it was past eleven o'clock,
although the breakfast things were still on the table. Kate would
usually bathe before breakfast, but Mrs. Greenow was never out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
room till half-past ten. <div class="bookquote">``I like the morning for contemplation,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
once said. <div class="bookquote">``When a woman has gone through all that I have suffered
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has a great deal to think of.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And it is so much more
comfortable to be a-thinking when one's in bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>said Jeannette, who
was present at the time. <div class="bookquote">``Child, hold your tongue,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>said Jeannette. But we'll return to the scene at the
breakfast-table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What don't you understand, aunt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You only danced twice last night, and once you stood up with Captain
Bellfield.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On purpose to ask after that poor woman who washes his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) clothes
without getting paid for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Kate; you didn't ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) anything of the kind, I'm sure.
It's very provoking. It is indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what harm can Captain Bellfield do me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What good can he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) do you? That's the question. You see, my dear,
years will go by. I don't mean to say you ain't quite as young
as ever you were, and nothing can be nicer and fresher than you
are;--especially since you took to bathing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, aunt, don't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, the truth must be spoken. I declare I don't think I ever
saw a young woman so improvident as you are. When are you to begin to
think about getting married if you don't do it now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never begin to think about it, till I buy my wedding
clothes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's nonsense,--sheer nonsense. How are you to get wedding clothes
if you have never thought about getting a husband? Didn't I see Mr.
Cheesacre ask you for a dance last night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) did; while you were talking to Captain Bellfield yourself,
aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain Bellfield can't hurt me, my dear. And why didn't you dance
with Mr. Cheesacre?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)'s a fat Norfolk farmer, with not an idea beyond the virtues of
stall-feeding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, every acre of it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) own land,--every acre! And he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
bought another farm for thirteen thousand pounds only last autumn.
They're better than the squires,--some of those gentlemen farmers;
they are indeed. And of all men in the world they're the easiest
managed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a recommendation, no doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it is;--a great recommendation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Greenow had no idea of joking when her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) mind was intent on serious
things. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)'s to take us to the picnic to-morrow, and I do hope
you'll manage to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) sit beside you. It'll be the place of
honour, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) gives all the wine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)'s picked up with that
man Bellfield, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)'s to be there; but if you allow your name to
be once mixed up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), it will be all over with you as far as
Yarmouth is concerned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't at all want to be mixed up with Captain Bellfield, as you
call it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) subsided into her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) novel, while Mrs.
Greenow busied herself about the good things for the picnic. In
truth, the aunt did not understand the niece. Whatsoever might be the
faults of Kate Vavasor, an unmaidenly desire of catching a husband
for herself was certainly not one of them.




<p/>CHAPTER VIII.

<p/>Mr. Cheesacre.


<p/>Yarmouth is not a happy place for a picnic. A picnic should be held
among green things. Green turf is absolutely an essential. There
should be trees, broken ground, small paths, thickets, and hidden
recesses. There should, if possible, be rocks, old timber, moss, and
brambles. There should certainly be hills and dales,--on a small
scale; and above all, there should be running water. There should be
no expanse. Jones should not be able to see all Greene's movements,
nor should Augusta always have her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) eye upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) sister Jane. But the
spot chosen for Mr. Cheesacre's picnic at Yarmouth had none of the
virtues above described. It was on the seashore. Nothing was visible
from the site but sand and sea. There were no trees there and nothing
green;--neither was there any running water. But there was a long,
dry, flat strand; there was an old boat half turned over, under which
it was proposed to dine; and in addition to this, benches, boards,
and some amount of canvas for shelter were provided by the liberality
of Mr. Cheesacre. Therefore it was called Mr. Cheesacre's picnic.

<p/>But it was to be a marine picnic, and therefore the essential
attributes of other picnics were not required. The idea had come from
some boating expeditions, in which mackerel had been caught, and
during which food had been eaten, not altogether comfortably, in the
boats. Then a thought had suggested itself to Captain Bellfield that
they might land and eat their food, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) friend Mr. Cheesacre had
promised his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) substantial aid. A lady had surmised that Ormesby sands
would be the very place for dancing in the cool of the evening. They
might <div class="bookquote">``Dance on the sand,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and yet no footing seen.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And
so the thing had progressed, and the picnic been inaugurated.

<p/>It was Mr. Cheesacre's picnic undoubtedly. Mr. Cheesacre was to supply
the boats, the wine, the cigars, the music, and the carpenter's work
necessary for the turning of the old boat into a banqueting saloon.
But Mrs. Greenow had promised to provide the eatables, and enjoyed as
much of the _éclat_ as the master of the festival. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had known Mr.
Cheesacre now for ten days and was quite intimate with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was a
stout, florid man, of about forty-five, a bachelor, apparently much
attached to ladies' society, bearing no sign of age except that he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>)
was rather bald, and that grey hairs had mixed themselves with his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>)
whiskers, very fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) farming, and yet somewhat ashamed of it
when he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) found himself in what he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) considered to be polite circles. And
he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) was, moreover, a little inclined to seek the honour which comes
from a well-filled and liberally-opened purse. He (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) liked to give a man
a dinner and then to boast of the dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) had given. He (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) was very
proud when he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) could talk of having mounted, for a day's hunting, any
man who might be supposed to be of higher rank than himself. <div class="bookquote">``I had
Grimsby with me the other day,--the son of old Grimsby of Hatherwick,
you know. Blessed if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) didn't stake my bay mare. But what matters? I
mounted him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) again the next day just the same.''  (<font color='red'><b>Some people</b></font>)</div>Some people thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was soft, for it was very well known throughout Norfolk that young
Grimsby would take a mount wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could get it. In these days
Mrs. Greenow had become intimate with Mr. Cheesacre, and had already
learned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was the undoubted owner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) own acres.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It wouldn't do for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``to be putting myself
forward, as if I were giving a party myself, or anything of that
sort;--would it now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, perhaps not. But you might come with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I will, Mr. Cheesacre, for that dear girl's sake. I should never
forgive myself if I debarred her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) from all the pleasures of youth,
because of my sorrows. I need hardly say that at such a time as this
nothing of that sort can give me any pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cheesacre, with solemn look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite out of the question.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>And Mrs. Greenow wiped away her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) tears.
<div class="bookquote">``For though as regards age I might dance on the sands as merrily as
the best of them--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I'm sure you could, Mrs. Greenow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How's a woman to enjoy herself if her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) heart lies buried?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it won't be so always, Mrs. Greenow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Greenow shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) head to show that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) hardly knew how to answer
such a question. Probably it would be so always;--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) did not
wish to put a damper on the present occasion by making so sad a
declaration. <div class="bookquote">``But as I was saying,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``if you and I do
it between us won't that be the surest way of having it come off
nicely?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Cheesacre thought that it would be the best way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly so;--I'll do the meat and pastry and fruit, and you shall do
the boats and the wine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the music,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre, <div class="bookquote">``and the expenses at the place.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
did not choose that any part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) outlay should go unnoticed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go halves in all that if you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow. But Mr.
Cheesacre had declined this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) did not begrudge the expense, but
only wished that it should be recognised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And, Mr. Cheesacre,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Greenow. <div class="bookquote">``I did mean to send the
music; I did, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't hear of it, Mrs. Greenow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I mention it now, because I was thinking of getting Blowehard
to come. That other man, Flutey, wouldn't do at all out in the open
air.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It shall be Blowehard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cheesacre; and it was Blowehard. Mrs.
Greenow liked to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) own way in these little things, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
heart did lie buried.

<p/>On the morning of the picnic Mr. Cheesacre came down to Montpelier
Parade with Captain Bellfield, whose linen on that occasion certainly
gave no outward sign of any quarrel between him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) washerwoman.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was got up wonderfully, and was prepared at all points for the
day's work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had on a pseudo-sailor's jacket, very liberally
ornamented with brass buttons, which displayed with great judgement
the exquisite shapes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) pseudo-sailor's duck trousers. Beneath
them there was a pair of very shiny patent-leather shoes, well
adapted for dancing on the sand, presuming him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) to be anxious of
doing so, as Venus offered to do, without leaving any footmarks. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
waistcoat was of a delicate white fabric, ornamented with very many
gilt buttons. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had bejewelled studs in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) shirt, and yellow kid
gloves on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) hands; having, of course, another pair in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) pocket
for the necessities of the evening. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) array was quite perfect, and
had stricken dismay into the heart of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) friend Cheesacre, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
joined that gentleman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was a well-made man, nearly six feet high,
with dark hair, dark whiskers, and dark moustache, nearly black, but
of that suspicious hue which to the observant beholder seems always
to tell a tale of the hairdresser's shop. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was handsome, too, with
well-arranged features,--but carrying, perhaps, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) nose some
first symptoms of the effects of midnight amusements. Upon the whole,
however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was a nice man to look at--for those who like to look on
nice men of that kind.

<p/>Cheesacre, too, had adopted something of a sailor's garb. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had on
a jacket of a rougher sort, coming down much lower than that of the
captain, being much looser, and perhaps somewhat more like a garment
which a possible seaman might possibly wear. But he (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) was disgusted
with himself the moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) saw Bellfield. His (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) heart had been
faint, and he (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) had not dared to ornament himself boldly as his (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) friend
had done. <div class="bookquote">``I say, Guss, you are a swell,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) exclaimed. It may be
explained that Captain Bellfield had been christened Gustavus.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know much about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>said the captain; <div class="bookquote">``my fellow sent me
this toggery, and said that it was the sort of thing. I'll change
with you if you like it.''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>But Cheesacre could not have worn that
jacket, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) walked on, hating himself.

<p/>It will be remembered that Mrs. Greenow had spoken with considerable
severity of Captain Bellfield's pretensions when discussing his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
character with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) niece; but, nevertheless, on the present occasion
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) received him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) with most gracious smiles. It may be that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>)
estimate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) character had been altered, or that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) was making
sacrifice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) own feelings in consideration of Mr. Cheesacre, who
was known to be the captain's intimate friend. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) had smiles for
both of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) had a wondrous power of smiling; and could, upon
occasion, give signs of peculiar favour to half a dozen different
gentlemen in as many minutes. They found her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) in the midst of hampers
which were not yet wholly packed, while Mrs. Jones, Jeannette, and the
cook of the household moved around her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>), on the outside of the circle,
ministering to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) wants. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) had in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) hand an outspread clean
napkin, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) wore fastened round her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) dress a huge coarse apron,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) might thus be protected from some possible ebullition of
gravy, or escape of salad mixture, or cream; but in other respects
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) was clothed in the fullest honours of widowhood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) had not
mitigated her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) weeds by half an inch. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) had scorned to make any
compromise between the world of pleasure and the world of woe. There
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) was, a widow, declared by herself to be of four months' standing,
with a buried heart, making ready a dainty banquet with skill and
liberality. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) was ready on the instant to sit down upon the baskets
in which the grouse pie had been just carefully inhumed, and talked
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) sainted lamb with a deluge of tears. If anybody didn't like
it, that person--might do the other thing. Mr. Cheesacre and Captain
Bellfield thought that they did like it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Cheesacre, if you haven't caught me before I've half done!
Captain Bellfield, I hope you think my apron becoming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything that you wear, Mrs. Greenow, is always becoming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk in that way when you know--; but never mind--we will
think of nothing sad to-day if we can help it. Will we, Mr.
Cheesacre?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear no; I should think not;--unless it should come on to rain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It won't rain--we won't think of such a thing. But, by the by,
Captain Bellfield, I and my niece do mean to send out a few things,
just in a bag you know, so that we may tidy ourselves up a little
after the sea. I don't want it mentioned, because if it gets about
among the other ladies, they'd think we wanted to make a dressing of
it;--and there wouldn't be room for them all; would there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; there wouldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cheesacre, who had been out on the
previous evening, inspecting, and perhaps limiting, the carpenters
in their work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow. <div class="bookquote">``But there won't be any harm,
will there, Mr. Cheesacre, in Jeanette's going out with our things?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>)'ll ride in the cart, you know, with the eatables. I know
Jeannette's a friend of yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall be delighted to have Jeanette,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cheesacre.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank ye, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>said Jeannette, with a curtsey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jeannette, don't you let Mr. Cheesacre turn your head; and mind you
behave yourself and be useful. Well; let me see;--what else is there?
Mrs. Jones, you might as well give me that ham now. Captain Bellfield,
hand it over. Don't you put it into the basket, because you'd turn it
the wrong side down. There now, if you haven't nearly made me upset
the apricot pie.''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain widow</b></font>)</div>Then, in the transfer of the dishes between the
captain and the widow, there occurred some little innocent by-play,
which seemed to give offence to Mr. Cheesacre; so that that gentleman
turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) back upon the hampers and took a step away towards the
door.

<p/>Mrs. Greenow saw the thing at a glance, and immediately applied
herself to cure the wound. <div class="bookquote">``What do you think, Mr. Cheesacre,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said
she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Kate wouldn't come down because she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) didn't choose that you
should see her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) with an apron on over her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) frock!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I don't know why Miss Vavasor should care about my seeing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I either. That's just what I said. Do step up into the
drawing-room; you'll find her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) there, and you can make her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) answer for
herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) wouldn't come down for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cheesacre. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) didn't
stir. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) wasn't willing to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) friend with the widow.

<p/>At length the last of the dishes was packed and Mrs. Greenow went
up-stairs with the two gentlemen. There they found Kate and two or
three other ladies who had promised to embark under the protection of
Mrs. Greenow's wings. There were the two Miss Fairstairs, whom Mrs.
Greenow had especially patronized, and who repaid that lady for her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
kindness by an amount of outspoken eulogy which startled Kate by its
audacity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your dear aunt!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny Fairstairs/Fanny</b></font>)</div>Fanny Fairstairs had said on coming into the room.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't think I ever came across a woman with such genuine milk of
human kindness!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor with so much true wit,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairstairs</b></font>) sister Charlotte,--who had been
called Charlie on the sands of Yarmouth for the last twelve years.

<p/>When the widow came into the room, they flew at her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) and devoured her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
with kisses, and swore that they had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) looking so well.
But as the bright new gloves which both the girls wore had been
presents from Mrs. Greenow, they certainly did owe her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) some affection.
There are not many ladies who would venture to bestow such gifts upon
their friends after so very short an acquaintance; but Mrs. Greenow
had a power that was quite her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) own in such matters. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was already
on a very confidential footing with the Miss Fairstairs, and had
given them much useful advice as to their future prospects.

<p/>And then was there a Mrs. Green, whose husband was first-lieutenant on
board a man-of-war on the West Indian Station. Mrs. Green was a quiet,
ladylike little woman, rather pretty, very silent, and, as one would
have thought, hardly adapted for the special intimacy of Mrs. Greenow.
But Mrs. Greenow had found out that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was alone, not very rich,
and in want of the solace of society. Therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had, from sheer
good-nature, forced herself upon Mrs. Green, and Mrs. Green, with much
trepidation, had consented to be taken to the picnic. <div class="bookquote">``I know your
husband would like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Greenow had said, <div class="bookquote">``and I hope I may live
to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that I made you go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div><p/>There came in also a brother of the Fairstairs girls, Joe Fairstairs,
a lanky, useless, idle young man, younger than them, who was supposed
to earn his (<font color='blue'><b>Fairstairs</b></font>) bread in an attorney's office at Norwich, or rather to be
preparing to earn it at some future time, and who was a heavy burden
upon all his (<font color='blue'><b>Fairstairs</b></font>) friends. <div class="bookquote">``We told Joe to come to the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny Fairstairs/Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny
to the widow, apologetically, <div class="bookquote">``because we thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) might be useful
in carrying down the cloaks.''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Greenow smiled graciously upon
Joe, and assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was charmed to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), without any
reference to such services as those mentioned.

<p/>And then they started. When they got to the door both Cheesacre and
the captain made an attempt to get possession of the widow's arm. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had it all arranged. Captain Bellfield found himself constrained
to attend to Mrs. Green, while Mr. Cheesacre walked down to the beach
beside Kate Vavasor. <div class="bookquote">``I'll take your arm, Mr. Joe,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow,
<div class="bookquote">``and the girls shall come with us.''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>But when they got to the boats,
round which the other comers to the picnic were already assembled,
Mr. Cheesacre,--although both the boats were for the day his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
own,--found himself separated from the widow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) got into that which
contained Kate Vavasor, and was shoved off from the beach while he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
saw Captain Bellfield arranging Mrs. Greenow's drapery. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had
declared to himself that it should be otherwise; and that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had
to pay the piper, the piper should play as he (<font color='blue'><b>piper</b></font>) liked it. But Mrs.
Greenow with a word or two had settled it all, and Mr. Cheesacre had
found himself to be powerless. <div class="bookquote">``How absurd Bellfield looks in that
jacket, doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) said to Kate, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) seat in the boat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think so? I thought it was so very pretty and becoming for
the occasion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Cheesacre hated Captain Bellfield, and regretted more than ever
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had not done something for his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) own personal adornment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
could not endure to think that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) friend, who paid for nothing,
should carry away the honours of the morning and defraud him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) of the
delights which should justly belong to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``It may be becoming,''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre; <div class="bookquote">``but don't you think it's awfully extravagant?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As to that I can't tell. You see I don't at all know what is the
price of a jacket covered all over with little brass buttons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the waistcoat, Miss Vavasor!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre, almost solemnly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The waistcoat I should think must have been expensive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dreadful! and he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)'s got nothing, Miss Vavasor; literally nothing.
Do you know,'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) reduced his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) voice to a whisper as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) made this
communication,--<div class="bookquote">``I lent him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) twenty pounds the day before yesterday;
I did indeed. You won't mention it again, of course. I tell you,
because, as you are seeing a good deal of him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) just now, I think it
right that you should know on what sort of a footing he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) stands.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It's all fair, they say, in love and war, and this small breach of
confidence was, we must presume, a love stratagem on the part of Mr.
Cheesacre. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was at this time smitten with the charms both of the
widow and of the niece, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) constantly found that the captain was
interfering with him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) on whichever side he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) turned himself. On the
present occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had desired to take the widow for his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) share, and
was, upon the whole, inclined to think that the widow was the more
worthy of his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) attentions. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had made certain little inquiries within
the last day or two, the answers to which had been satisfactory.
These he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had by no means communicated to his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) friend, to whom, indeed,
he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had expressed an opinion that Mrs. Greenow was after all only a
flash in the pan. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) does very well pour passer le temps,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>the
captain had answered. Mr. Cheesacre had not quite understood the exact
gist of the captain's meaning, but had felt certain that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) friend
was playing him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) false.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want it to be mentioned again, Miss Vavasor,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) continued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such things should not be mentioned at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>Kate replied,
having been angered at the insinuation that the nature of Captain
Bellfield's footing could be a matter of any moment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, they shouldn't; and therefore I know that I'm quite safe with
you, Miss Vavasor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)'s a very pleasant fellow, very; and has seen
the world,--uncommon; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)'s better for eating and drinking with
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) is for buying and selling with, as we say in Norfolk. Do you
like Norfolk, Miss Vavasor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never was in it before, and now I've only seen Yarmouth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A nice place, Yarmouth, very; but you should come up and see our
lands. I suppose you don't know that we feed one-third of England
during the winter months.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We do, though; nobody knows what a county Norfolk is. Taking it
altogether, including the game you know, and Lord Nelson, and its
watering-places and the rest of it, I don't think there's a county
in England to beat it. Fancy feeding one-third of all England and
Wales!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With bread and cheese, do you mean, and those sort of things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Beef!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cheesacre, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) patriotic energy he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) repeated
the word aloud. <div class="bookquote">``Beef! Yes indeed; but if you were to tell them that
in London they wouldn't believe you. Ah! you should certainly come
down and see our lands. The 7.45 A.M. train would take you through
Norwich to my door, as one may say, and you would be back by the 6.22
P.M.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>In this way he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) brought himself back again into good-humour,
feeling, that in the absence of the widow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) could not do better
than make progress with the niece.

<p/>In the mean time Mrs. Greenow and the captain were getting on very
comfortably in the other boat. <div class="bookquote">``Take an oar, Captain,''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>one of the
men had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had placed the ladies. <div class="bookquote">``Not to-day,
Jack,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had answered. <div class="bookquote">``I'll content myself with being bo`san this
morning.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The best thing as the bo`san does is to pipe all hands to
grog,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man. <div class="bookquote">``I won't be behind in that either,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>said the
captain; and so they all went on swimmingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a fine generous fellow your friend, Mr. Cheesacre, is!''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the
widow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) is; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)'s a capital fellow in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) way. Some of these Norfolk
farmers are no end of good fellows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)'s something more than a common farmer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)'s visited
by the people about where he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) lives, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, in a sort of a way. The county people, you know, keep
themselves very much to themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's of course. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) house;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) has a good sort of place,
hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes;--a very good house;--a little too near to the horse-pond
for my taste. But when a man gets his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money out of the till, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
mustn't be ashamed of the counter;--must he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Mrs. Greenow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could live like a gentleman if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) let his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own land, couldn't
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends upon how a gentleman wishes to live.''  (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div>Here the privacy
of their conversation was interrupted by an exclamation from a young
lady to the effect that Charlie Fairstairs was becoming sick. This
Charlie stoutly denied, and proved the truth of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) assertion by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
behaviour. Soon after this they completed their marine adventures,
and prepared to land close to the spot at which the banquet was
prepared.




<p/>CHAPTER IX.

<p/>The Rivals.


<p/>There had been a pretence of fishing, but no fish had been caught.
It was soon found that such an amusement would interfere with the
ladies' dresses, and the affairs had become too serious to allow of
any trivial interruption. <div class="bookquote">``I really think, Mr. Cheesacre,''  (<font color='red'><b>an mother</b></font>)</div>an anxious
mother had said, <div class="bookquote">``that you'd better give it up. The water off the
nasty cord has got all over Maria's dress, already.''  (<font color='red'><b>an mother</b></font>)</div>Maria made a
faint protest that it did not signify in the least; but the fishing
was given up,--not without an inward feeling on the part of Mr.
Cheesacre that if Maria chose to come out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) boat,
having been invited especially to fish, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ought to have put up with
the natural results. <div class="bookquote">``There are people who like to take everything
and never like to give anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) said to Kate afterwards, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
was walking up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) to the picnic dinner. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was unreasonable
and unjust. The girls had graced his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) party with their best hats and
freshest muslins, not that they might see him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) catch a mackerel, but
that they might flirt and dance to the best advantage. <div class="bookquote">``You can't
suppose that any girl will like to be drenched with sea-water when
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has taken so much trouble with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) starch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate. <div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
shouldn't come fishing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cheesacre. <div class="bookquote">``I hate such airs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div><p/>But when they arrived at the old boat, Mrs. Greenow shone forth
pre-eminently as the mistress of the occasion, altogether
overshadowing Mr. Cheesacre by the extent of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) authority. There was
a little contest for supremacy between them, invisible to the eyes
of the multitude; but Mr. Cheesacre in such a matter had not a chance
against Mrs. Greenow. I am disposed to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) would have
reigned even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had not contributed to the eatables; but
with that point in her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) favour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was able to make herself supreme.
Jeannette, too, was her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) servant, which was a great thing. Mr.
Cheesacre soon gave way; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) bustled about and was
conspicuous, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) bustled about in obedience to orders received, and
became a head servant. Captain Bellfield also made himself useful,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) drove Mr. Cheesacre into paroxysms of suppressed anger by
giving directions, and by having those directions obeyed. A man to
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had lent twenty pounds the day before yesterday, and who had
not contributed so much as a bottle of champagne!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're to dine at four, and now it's half-past three,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Greenow, addressing herself to the multitude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And to begin to dance at six,''  (<font color='red'><b>an lady</b></font>)</div>said an eager young lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maria, hold your tongue,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the young lady's mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, we'll dine at four,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cheesacre. <div class="bookquote">``And as for the music,
I've ordered it to be here punctual at half-past five. We're to have
three horns, cymbals, triangle, and a drum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How very nice; isn't it, Mrs. Greenow?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie/Charlie Fairstairs</b></font>)</div>said Charlie Fairstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now suppose we begin to unpack,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain Bellfield. <div class="bookquote">``Half
the fun is in arranging the things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, yes; more than half,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny Fairstairs/Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny Fairstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bellfield, don't mind about the hampers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre. <div class="bookquote">``Wine is a
ticklish thing to handle, and there's my man there to manage it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's odd if I don't know more about wine than the boots from the
hotel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div>said Bellfield. This allusion to the boots almost cowed Mr.
Cheesacre, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) turn away, leaving Bellfield with the widow.

<p/>There was a great unpacking, during which Captain Bellfield and Mrs.
Greenow constantly had their heads in the same hamper. I by no means
intend to insinuate that there was anything wrong in this. People
engaged together in unpacking pies and cold chickens must have their
heads in the same hamper. But a great intimacy was thereby produced,
and the widow seemed to have laid aside altogether that prejudice
of hers with reference to the washerwoman. There was a long table
placed on the sand, sheltered by the upturned boat from the land
side, but open towards the sea, and over this, supported on poles,
there was an awning. Upon the whole the arrangement was not an
uncomfortable one for people who had selected so very uncomfortable
a dining-room as the sand of the sea-shore. Much was certainly due
to Mr. Cheesacre for the expenditure he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had incurred,--and something
perhaps to Captain Bellfield for his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) ingenuity in having suggested
it.

<p/>Now came the placing of the guests for dinner, and Mr. Cheesacre
made another great effort. <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) said, aloud,
<div class="bookquote">``Bellfield and I will take the two ends of the table, and Mrs. Greenow
shall sit at my right hand.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This was not only boldly done, but there
was a propriety in it which at first sight seemed to be irresistible.
Much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had hated and did hate the captain, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had skilfully made
the proposition in such a way as to flatter him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), and it seemed for a
few moments as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) were going to have it all his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) own way. But
Captain Bellfield was not a man to submit to defeat in such a matter
as this without an effort. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think that will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Greenow gives the dinner, and Cheesacre gives the wine. We must
have them at the two ends of the table. I am sure Mrs. Greenow won't
refuse to allow me to hand her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) to the place which belongs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>). I
will sit at her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) right hand and be her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) minister.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Greenow did not
refuse,--and so the matter was adjusted.

<p/>Mr. Cheesacre took his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) seat in despair. It was nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had Kate Vavasor at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) left hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) liked talking to Kate very
well, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) could not enjoy that pleasure while Captain Bellfield
was in the very act of making progress with the widow. <div class="bookquote">``One would
think that he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) had given it himself; wouldn't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said to Maria's
mother, who sat at his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) right hand.

<p/>The lady did not in the least understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Given what?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, the music and the wine and all the rest of it. There are some
people full of that kind of impudence. How they manage to carry it on
without ever paying a shilling, I never could tell. I know I have to
pay my way, and something over and beyond generally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria</b></font>)</div><p/>Maria's mother said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria mother</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had other daughters there
besides Maria, and was looking down the table to see whether they
were judiciously placed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) beauty, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) youngest one, Ophelia, was
sitting next to that ne'er-do-well Joe Fairstairs, and this made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) unhappy. <div class="bookquote">``Ophelia, my dear, you are dreadfully in the draught;
there's a seat up here, just opposite, where you'll be more
comfortable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no draught here, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Ophelia, without the slightest
sign of moving. Perhaps Ophelia liked the society of that lanky,
idle, useless young man.

<p/>The mirth of the table certainly came from Mrs. Greenow's end. The
widow had hardly taken her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) place before she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) got up again and changed
with the captain. It was found that the captain could better carve
the great grouse pie from the end than from the side. Cheesacre, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) saw this, absolutely threw down his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) knife and fork violently upon
the table. <div class="bookquote">``Is anything the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria</b></font>)</div>said Maria's mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Matter!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) head in grief of heart and
vexation of spirit, and resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) knife and fork. Kate watched
it all, and was greatly amused. <div class="bookquote">``I never saw a man so nearly
broken-hearted,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) letter to Alice the next day.
<div class="bookquote">``Eleven, thirteen, eighteen, twenty-one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre to himself,
reckoning up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) misery the number of pounds sterling which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
would have to pay for being ill-treated in this way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ladies and gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain Bellfield, as soon as the eating
was over, <div class="bookquote">``if I may be permitted to get upon my legs for two minutes,
I am going to propose a toast to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div>The real patron of the feast
had actually not yet swallowed his (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) last bit of cheese. The thing was
indecent in the violence of its injustice.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: Captain Bellfield proposes a toast.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, Captain Bellfield,''  (<font color='red'><b>the patron</b></font>)</div>said the patron, indifferent to
the cheese in his (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) throat, <div class="bookquote">``I'll propose the toast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the patron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing on earth could be better, my dear fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>said the captain,
<div class="bookquote">``and I'm sure I should be the last man in the world to take the job
out of the hands of one who would do it so much better than I can;
but as it's your health that we're going to drink, I really don't see
how you are to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div><p/>Cheesacre grunted and sat down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) certainly could not propose his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
own health, nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) complain of the honour that was to be done
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>). It was very proper that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) health should be drunk, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had
now to think of the words in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) would return thanks. But the
extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) horror may be imagined when Bellfield got up and made a
most brilliant speech in praise of Mrs. Greenow. For full five minutes
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) went on without mentioning the name of Cheesacre. Yarmouth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
said, had never in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) days been so blessed as it had been this year
by the presence of the lady who was now with them. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had come among
them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) declared, forgetful of herself and of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) great sorrows,
with the sole desire of adding something to the happiness of others.
Then Mrs. Greenow had taken out her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief, sweeping back
the broad ribbons of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) cap over her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) shoulders. Altogether the scene
was very affecting, and Cheesacre was driven to madness. They were
the very words that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had intended to speak himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate all this kind of thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) said to Kate. <div class="bookquote">``It's so fulsome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``After-dinner speeches never mean anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate.

<p/>At last, when Bellfield had come to an end of praising Mrs. Greenow,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) told the guests that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) wished to join his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) friend Mr. Cheesacre in
the toast, the more so as it could hardly be hoped that Mrs. Greenow
would herself rise to return thanks. There was no better fellow than
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) friend Cheesacre, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had known for he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) would not say how
many years. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was quite sure they would all have the most sincere
pleasure in joining the health of Mr. Cheesacre with that of Mrs.
Greenow. Then there was a clattering of glasses and a murmuring of
healths, and Mr. Cheesacre slowly got upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) legs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very much obliged to this company,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and to my friend
Bellfield, who really is,--but perhaps that doesn't signify now. I've
had the greatest pleasure in getting up this little thing, and I'd
made up my mind to propose Mrs. Greenow's health; but, h'm, ha, no
doubt it has been in better hands. Perhaps, considering all things,
Bellfield might have waited.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With such a subject on my hands, I couldn't wait a moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't interrupt you, Captain Bellfield, and perhaps you'll let me
go on without interrupting me. We've all drunk Mrs. Greenow's health,
and I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)'s very much obliged. So am I for the honour you've
done me. I have taken some trouble in getting up this little thing,
and I hope you like it. I think somebody said something about
liberality. I beg to assure you that I don't think of that for a
moment. Somebody must pay for these sort of things, and I'm always
very glad to take my turn. I dare say Bellfield will give us the
next picnic, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'ll appoint a day before the end of the month,
I shall be happy to be one of the party.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) sat down with some
inward satisfaction, fully convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had given his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) enemy a
fatal blow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing on earth would give me so much pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div>said Bellfield.
After that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) turned again to Mrs. Greenow and went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
private conversation.

<p/>There was no more speaking, nor was there much time for other
after-dinner ceremonies. The three horns, the cymbals, the triangle,
and the drum were soon heard tuning-up behind the banqueting-hall,
and the ladies went to the further end of the old boat to make their
preparations for the dance. Then it was that the thoughtful care of
Mrs. Greenow, in having sent Jeannette with brushes, combs, clean
handkerchiefs, and other little knick-knackeries, became so apparent.
It was said that the widow herself actually changed her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) cap,--which
was considered by some to be very unfair, as there had been an
understanding that there should be no dressing. On such occasions
ladies are generally willing to forego the advantage of dressing
on the condition that other ladies shall forego the same advantage;
but when this compact is broken by any special lady, the treason
is thought to be very treacherous. It is as though a fencer should
remove the button from the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>fencer</b></font>) foil. But Mrs. Greenow was so
good-natured in tendering the services of Jeannette to all the young
ladies, and was so willing to share with others those good things of
the toilet which her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) care had provided, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) cap was forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
by the most of those present.

<p/>When ladies have made up their minds to dance they will dance let the
circumstances of the moment be ever so antagonistic to that exercise.
A ploughed field in February would not be too wet, nor the side of a
house too uneven. In honest truth the sands of the seashore are not
adapted for the exercise. It was all very well for Venus to make the
promise, but when making it she (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) knew that Adonis would not keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>)
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) word. Let any lightest-limbed nymph try it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) will find
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) leaves most palpable footing. The sands in question were
doubtless compact, firm, and sufficiently moist to make walking on
them comfortable; but they ruffled themselves most uncomfortably
under the unwonted pressure to which they were subjected.
Nevertheless our friends did dance on the sands; finding, however,
that quadrilles and Sir Roger de Coverley suited them better than
polkas and waltzes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my friend, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Greenow said to Mr. Cheesacre when that
gentleman endeavoured to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) to stand up; <div class="bookquote">``Kate will be
delighted I am sure to join you,--but as for me, you must excuse me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mr. Cheesacre was not inclined at that moment to ask Kate Vavasor
to dance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was possessed by an undefined idea that Kate
had snubbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), and as Kate's fortune was, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) said, literally
nothing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was not at all disposed to court her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) favour at the
expense of such suffering to himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not quite sure that I'll dance myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), seating himself
in a corner of the tent by Mrs. Greenow's side. Captain Bellfield at
that moment was seen leading Miss Vavasor away to a new place on
the sands, whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was followed by a score of dancers; and Mr.
Cheesacre saw that now at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) might reap the reward for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
had laboured. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was alone with the widow, and having been made bold
by wine, had an opportunity of fighting his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) battle, than which none
better could ever be found. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was himself by no means a poor man,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) despised poverty in others. It was well that there should be
poor gentry, in order that they might act as satellites to those who,
like himself, had money. As to Mrs. Greenow's money, there was no
doubt. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) knew it all to a fraction. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had spread for herself, or
some one else had spread for her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), a report that her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) wealth was almost
unlimited; but the forty thousand pounds was a fact, and any such
innocent fault as that little fiction might well be forgiven to a
woman endorsed with such substantial virtues. And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was handsome
too. Mr. Cheesacre, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) matured charms, sometimes felt
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) should have been smitten even without the forty thousand
pounds. <div class="bookquote">``By George! there's flesh and blood,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had once said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
friend Bellfield before he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had begun to suspect that man's treachery.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) admiration must then have been sincere, for at that time the
forty thousand pounds was not an ascertained fact. Looking at the
matter in all its bearings Mr. Cheesacre thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) couldn't do
better. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) wooing should be fair, honest, and above board. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was a
thriving man, and what might not they two do in Norfolk if they put
their wealth together?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Cheesacre, you should join them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow; <div class="bookquote">``they'll
not half enjoy themselves without you. Kate will think that you mean
to neglect her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shan't dance, Mrs. Greenow, unless you like to stand up for a set.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my friend, no; I shall not do that. I fear you forget how recent
has been my bereavement. Your asking me is the bitterest reproach to
me for having ventured to join your festive board.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my honour I didn't mean it, Mrs. Greenow. I didn't mean it,
indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not suspect you. It would have been unmanly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And nobody can say that of me. There isn't a man or woman in Norfolk
that wouldn't say I was manly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm quite sure of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have my faults, I'm aware.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what are your faults, Mr. Cheesacre?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; perhaps I'm extravagant. But it's only in these kind of
things you know, when I spend a little money for the sake of making
my friends happy. When I'm about, on the lands at home, I ain't
extravagant, I can tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Extravagance is a great vice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I ain't extravagant in that sense;--not a bit in the world. But
when a man's enamoured, and perhaps looking out for a wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does
like to be a little free, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And are you looking out for a wife, Mr. Cheesacre?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I told you I suppose you'd only laugh at me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; indeed I would not. I am not given to joking when any one that I
regard speaks to me seriously.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ain't you though? I'm so glad of that. When one has really got a
serious thing to say, one doesn't like to have fun poked at one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And, besides, how could I laugh at marriages, seeing how happy I
have been in that condition?--so--very--happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>and Mrs. Greenow put
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) handkerchief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So happy that you'll try it again some day; won't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, Mr. Cheesacre; never. Is that the way you talk of serious
things without joking? Anything like love--love of that sort--is
over for me. It lies buried under the sod with my poor dear departed
saint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Mrs. Greenow,'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>--and Cheesacre, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) prepared to argue the
question with her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), got nearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) in the corner behind the
table,--<div class="bookquote">``But, Mrs. Greenow, care killed a cat, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And sometimes I think that care will kill me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, by George; not if I can prevent it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're very kind, Mr. Cheesacre; but there's no preventing such care
as mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't there though? I'll tell you what, Mrs. Greenow; I'm in earnest,
I am indeed. If you'll inquire, you'll find there isn't a fellow in
Norfolk pays his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) way better than I do, or is better able to do it. I
don't pay a sixpence of rent, and I sit upon seven hundred acres of
as good land as there is in the county. There's not an acre that
won't do me a bullock and a half. Just put that and that together,
and see what it comes to. And, mind you, some of these fellows that
farm their own land are worse off than if they'd rent to pay. They've
borrowed so much to carry on with, that the interest is more than
rent. I don't owe a sixpence to ere a man or ere a company in the
world. I can walk into every bank in Norwich without seeing my
master. There ain't any of my paper flying about, Mrs. Greenow. I'm
Samuel Cheesacre of Oileymead, and it's all my own.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>Mr. Cheesacre, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) thus spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) good fortunes and firm standing in the world,
became impetuous in the energy of the moment, and brought down his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
fist powerfully on the slight table before them. The whole fabric
rattled, and the boat resounded, but the noise he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had made seemed to
assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It's all my own, Mrs. Greenow, and the half of it shall
be yours if you'll please to take it;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) hand
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), not as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) intended to grasp hers in a grasp of love,
but as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) expected some hand-pledge from her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) as a token that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
accepted the bargain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you'd known Greenow, Mr. Cheesacre--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was a very good sort of man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you'd known him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), you would not have addressed me in this way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What difference would that make? My idea is that care killed a cat,
as I said before. I never knew what was the good of being unhappy.
If I find early mangels don't do on a bit of land, then I sow late
turnips; and never cry after spilt milk. Greenow was the early
mangels; I'll be the late turnips. Come then, say the word. There
ain't a bedroom in my house,--not one of the front ones,--that isn't
mahogany furnished!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's furniture to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) handkerchief to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>Just at this moment Maria's mother stepped in under the canvas. It
was most inopportune. Mr. Cheesacre felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was progressing well,
and was conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had got safely over those fences in the
race which his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) bashfulness would naturally make difficult to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had done this under the influence of the champagne, and
was aware that it might not be easy to procure again a combination
of circumstances that would be so beneficial to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>). But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was
interrupted just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was expecting success. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was interrupted,
and felt himself to be looking like a guilty creature under the eye
of the strange lady. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had not a word to say; but drawing himself
suddenly a foot and half away from the widow's side, sat there
confessing his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) guilt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) face.

<p/>Mrs. Greenow felt no guilt, and was afraid of no strange eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Cheesacre and I are talking about farming,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh; farming!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria</b></font>)</div>answered Maria's mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Cheesacre thinks that turnips are better than early mangels,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I prefer the early mangels,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think nature
ever intended those late crops. What do you say, Mrs. Walker?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I daresay Mr. Cheesacre understands what he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)'s about when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)'s at
home,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what a bit of land can do as well as any man in Norfolk,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It may be very well in Norfolk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow, rising from her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
seat; <div class="bookquote">``but the practice isn't thought much of in the other counties
with which I am better acquainted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd just come in to say that I thought we might be getting to the
boats,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Walker/Walker</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Walker. <div class="bookquote">``My Ophelia is so delicate.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ophelia</b></font>)</div>At this moment
the delicate Ophelia was to be seen, under the influence of the
music, taking a distant range upon the sands with Joe Fairstairs' arm
round her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) waist. The attitude was justified by the tune that was in
progress, and there is no reason why a galop on the sands should have
any special termination in distance, as it must have in a room. But,
under such circumstances, Mrs. Walker's solicitude was not
unreasonable.

<p/>The erratic steps of the distant dancers were recalled and
preparations were made for the return journey. Others had strayed
besides the delicate Ophelia and the idle Joe, and some little time
was taken up in collecting the party. The boats had to be drawn down,
and the boatmen fetched from their cans and tobacco-pipes. <div class="bookquote">``I hope
they're sober,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Walker/Walker</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Walker, with a look of great dismay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sober as judges,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div>said Bellfield, who had himself been looking after
the remains of Mr. Cheesacre's hampers, while that gentleman had been
so much better engaged in the tent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Walker/Walker</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Walker, <div class="bookquote">``I know that they play all manner of
tricks when they're--in liquor. They'd think nothing of taking us out
to sea, Mrs. Greenow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Walker/Walker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I do wish they would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Ophelia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ophelia, mind you come in the boat with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) mother, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) looked very savage when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) gave the order. It was Mrs. Walker's
intention that that boat should not carry Joe Fairstairs. But Joe and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) daughter together were too clever for her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>). When the boats went
off she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) found herself to be in that one over which Mr. Cheesacre
presided, while the sinning Ophelia with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) good-for-nothing admirer
were under the more mirthful protection of Captain Bellfield.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma will be so angry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Ophelia, <div class="bookquote">``and it was all your fault. I
did mean to go into the other boat. Don't, Mr. Fairstairs.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ophelia</b></font>)</div>Then they
got settled down in their seats, to the satisfaction, let us hope, of
them both.

<p/>Mr. Cheesacre had vainly endeavoured to arrange that Mrs. Greenow
should return with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>). But not only was Captain Bellfield opposed
to such a change in their positions, but so also was Mrs. Greenow. <div class="bookquote">``I
think we'd better go back as we came,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) said, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) hand to
the Captain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain Bellfield. <div class="bookquote">``Why should there be any
change? Cheesacre, old fellow, mind you look after Mrs. Walker. Come
along, my hearty.''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>It really almost appeared that Captain Bellfield
was addressing Mrs. Greenow as <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) hearty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>but it must be presumed
that the term of genial endearment was intended for the whole boat's
load. Mrs. Greenow took her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) place on the comfortable broad bench in
the stern, and Bellfield seated himself beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>), with the tiller
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you're going to steer, Captain Bellfield, I beg that you'll be
careful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Careful,--and with you on board!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you know
that I would sooner perish beneath the waves than that a drop of
water should touch you roughly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you see, we might perish beneath the waves together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Together! What a sweet word that is;--perish together! If it were
not that there might be something better even than that, I would wish
to perish in such company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I should not wish anything of the kind, Captain Bellfield, and
therefore pray be careful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no perishing by water on that occasion. Mr. Cheesacre's boat
reached the pier at Yarmouth first, and gave up its load without
accident. Very shortly afterwards Captain Bellfield's crew reached
the same place in the same state of preservation. <div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>),
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) handed out Mrs. Greenow. <div class="bookquote">``I have brought you to no harm, at any
rate as yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And, as I hope, will not do so hereafter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May the heavens forbid it, Mrs. Greenow! Whatever may be our lots
hereafter,--yours I mean and mine,--I trust that yours may be free
from all disaster. Oh, that I might venture to hope that, at some
future day, the privilege might be mine of protecting you from all
danger!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can protect myself very well, I can assure you. Good night,
Captain Bellfield. We won't take you and Mr. Cheesacre out of your
way;--will we, Kate? We have had a most pleasant day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div><p/>They were now upon the esplanade, and Mrs. Greenow's house was to the
right, whereas the lodgings of both the gentlemen were to the left.
Each of them fought hard for the privilege of accompanying the widow
to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) door; but Mrs. Greenow was self-willed, and upon this occasion
would have neither of them. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Joe Fairstairs must pass the house,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) will see us home. Mr. Cheesacre, good night. Indeed
you shall not;--not a step.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>There was that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) voice which
induced Mr. Cheesacre to obey her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), and which made Captain Bellfield
aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) would only injure his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) cause if he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) endeavoured to make
further progress in it on the present occasion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Kate, what do you think of the day?''  (<font color='red'><b>the aunt</b></font>)</div>the aunt said when she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
was alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) niece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never think much about such days, aunt. It was all very well, but
I fear I have not the temperament fitted for enjoying the fun. I
envied Ophelia Walker because she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) made herself thoroughly happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do like to see girls enjoy themselves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow, <div class="bookquote">``I do,
indeed;--and young men too. It seems so natural; why shouldn't young
people flirt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or old people either for the matter of that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or old people either,--if they don't do any harm to anybody. I'll
tell you what it is, Kate; people have become so very virtuous, that
they're driven into all manner of abominable resources for amusement
and occupation. If I had sons and daughters I should think a little
flirting the very best thing for them as a safety valve. When people
get to be old, there's a difficulty. They want to flirt with the
young people and the young people don't want them. If the old people
would be content to flirt together, I don't see why they should ever
give it up;--till they're obliged to give up every thing, and go
away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div><p/>That was Mrs. Greenow's doctrine on the subject of flirtation.




<p/>CHAPTER X.

<p/>Nethercoats.


<p/>We will leave Mrs. Greenow with her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) niece and two sisters at Yarmouth,
and returning by stages to London, will call upon Mr. Grey at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
place in Cambridgeshire as we pass by. I believe it is conceded by
all the other counties, that Cambridgeshire possesses fewer rural
beauties than any other county in England. It is very flat; it is
not well timbered; the rivers are merely dikes; and in a very large
portion of the county the farms and fields are divided simply by
ditches--not by hedgerows. Such arrangements are, no doubt, well
adapted for agricultural purposes, but are not conducive to rural
beauty. Mr. Grey's residence was situated in a part of Cambridgeshire
in which the above-named characteristics are very much marked. It was
in the Isle of Ely, some few miles distant from the Cathedral town,
on the side of a long straight road, which ran through the fields
for miles without even a bush to cheer it. The name of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) place was
Nethercoats, and here he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) lived generally throughout the year, and
here he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) intended to live throughout his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) life.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) father had held a prebendal stall at Ely in times when prebendal
stalls were worth more than they are at present, and having also
been possessed of a living in the neighbourhood, had amassed a
considerable sum of money. With this he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had during his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) life purchased
the property of Nethercoats, and had built on it the house in which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) son now lived. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had married late in life, and had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) wife
soon after the birth of an only child. The house had been built in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) own parish, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) wife had lived there for a few months and had
died there. But after that event the old clergyman had gone back to
his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) residence in the Close at Ely, and there John Grey had had the
home of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) youth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had been brought up under his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) father's eye,
having been sent to no public school. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had gone to Cambridge,
had taken college honours, and had then, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) father dying exactly at
this time, declined to accept a fellowship. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) father had left to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) an income of some fifteen hundred a year, and with this he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) sat
himself down, near to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) college friends, near also to the old
cathedral which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) loved, in the house which his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) father had built.

<p/>But though Nethercoats possessed no beauty of scenery, though the
country around it was in truth as uninteresting as any country
could be, it had many delights of its own. The house itself was as
excellent a residence for a country gentleman of small means as
taste and skill together could construct. I doubt whether prettier
rooms were ever seen than the drawing-room, the library, and the
dining-room at Nethercoats. They were all on the ground-floor, and
all opened out on to the garden and lawn. The library, which was
the largest of the three, was a handsome chamber, and so filled as
to make it well known in the University as one of the best private
collections in that part of England. But perhaps the gardens of
Nethercoats constituted its greatest glory. They were spacious
and excellently kept up, and had been originally laid out with
that knowledge of gardening without which no garden, merely as a
garden, can be effective. And such, of necessity, was the garden of
Nethercoats. Fine single forest trees there were none there, nor was
it possible that there should have been any such. Nor could there
be a clear rippling stream with steep green banks, and broken rocks
lying about its bed. Such beauties are beauties of landscape, and do
not of their nature belong to a garden. But the shrubs of Nethercoats
were of the rarest kind, and had been long enough in their present
places to have reached the period of their beauty. Nothing had been
spared that a garden could want. The fruit-trees were perfect in
their kind, and the glass-houses were so good and so extensive that
John Grey in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) prudence was some times tempted to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had
too much of them.

<p/>It must be understood that there were no grounds, according to
the meaning usually given to that word, belonging to the house at
Nethercoats. Between the garden and the public road there was a
paddock belonging to the house, along the side of which, but divided
from it by a hedge and shrubbery, ran the private carriageway up to
the house. This swept through the small front flower-garden, dividing
it equally; but the lawns and indeed the whole of that which made
the beauty of the place lay on the back of the house, on which side
opened the windows from the three sitting-rooms. Down on the public
road there stood a lodge at which lived one of the gardeners. There
was another field of some six or seven acres, to which there was
a gate from the corner of the front paddock, and which went round
two sides of the garden. This was Nethercoats, and the whole estate
covered about twelve acres.

<p/>It was not a place for much bachelor enjoyment of that sort generally
popular with bachelors; nevertheless Mr. Grey had been constant in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
residence there for the seven years which had now elapsed since he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) college. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) easy access to Cambridge had probably done
much to mitigate what might otherwise have been the too great tedium
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) life; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had, prompted thereto by early associations,
found most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) society in the Close of Ely Cathedral. But, with
all the delight he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) could derive from these two sources, there had
still been many solitary hours in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) life, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had gradually
learned to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) of all men wanted a companion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) home.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) visits to London had generally been short and far between,
occasioned probably by some need in the library, or by the necessity
of some slight literary transaction with the editor or publisher of a
periodical. In one of these visits he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) had met Alice Vavasor, and had
remained in Town,--I will not say till Alice had promised to share
his (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) home in Cambridgeshire, but so long that he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) had resolved before
he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) went that he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) would ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to do so. He (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and we
know that he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) had been successful. He (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) had obtained her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) promise, and
from that moment all his (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) life had been changed for him (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>). Hitherto at
Nethercoats his (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) little smoking-room, his (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) books, and his (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) plants had
been everything to him (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>). Now he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) began to surround himself with an
infinity of feminine belongings, and to promise himself an infinity
of feminine blessings, wondering much that he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) should have been
content to pass so long a portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) life in the dull seclusion
which he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) had endured. He (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) was not by nature an impatient man; but now
he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) became impatient, longing for the fruition of his (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) new idea of
happiness,--longing to have that as his (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) own which he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) certainly loved
beyond all else in the world, and which, perhaps, was all he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) had ever
loved with the perfect love of equality. But though impatient, and
fully aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) own impatience, he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) acknowledged to himself that
Alice could not be expected to share it. He (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) could plan nothing
now,--could have no pleasure in life that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was not expected to
share. But as yet it could not be so with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) house
in London, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) town society, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father. And, inasmuch as the
change for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would be much greater than it would be for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), it was
natural that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should require some small delay. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had not pressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). At least he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had not pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) with that eager pressure which
a girl must resist with something of the opposition of a contest,
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) resist it at all. But in truth his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) impatience was now waxing
strong, and during the absence in Switzerland of which we have
spoken, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) resolved that a marriage very late in the autumn,--that a
marriage even in winter, would be better than a marriage postponed
till the following year. It was not yet late in August when the party
returned from their tour. Would not a further delay of two months
suffice for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bride?

<p/>Alice had written to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) occasionally from Switzerland, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
first two letters had been very charming. They had referred almost
exclusively to the tour, and had been made pleasant with some
slightly coloured account of George Vavasor's idleness, and of Kate's
obedience to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother's behests. Alice had never written much of
love in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) love-letters, and Grey was well enough contented with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
style, though it was not impassioned. As for doubting her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) love, it
was not in the heart of the man to do so after it had been once
assured to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) word. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not so slightly respect himself
or her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) as to leave room for such a doubt in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bosom. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a man
who could never have suggested to himself that a woman loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) till
the fact was there before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but who having ascertained, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
might think, the fact, could never suggest to himself that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) love
would fail him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) first two letters from Switzerland had been very
pleasant; but after that there had seemed to have crept over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a
melancholy which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) unconsciously transferred to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) words, and
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not but taste in them,--at first unconsciously, also,
but soon with so plain a flavour that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recognised it, and made it a
matter of mental inquiry. During the three or four last days of the
journey, while they were at Basle and on their way home, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not
written. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did write on the day after her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arrival, having then
received from Mr. Grey a letter, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) how very much
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would add to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) happiness if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would now agree that their
marriage should not be postponed beyond the end of October. This
letter she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) found in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) room on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) return, and this she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered at
once. And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered it in such words that Mr. Grey resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
would at once go to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in London. I will give her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) letter at length,
as I shall then be best able to proceed with my story quickly.


<p/>Queen Anne Street,
-- August, 186--.

<p/>DEAREST JOHN,--

<p/>We reached home yesterday tired enough, as we came through
from Paris without stopping. I may indeed say that we
came through from Strasbourg, as we only slept in Paris.
I don't like Strasbourg. A steeple, after all, is not
everything, and putting the steeple aside, I don't think
the style is good. But the hotel was uncomfortable, which
goes for so much;--and then we were saturated with beauty
of a better kind.

<p/>I got your letter directly I came in last night, and
I suppose I had better dash at it at once. I would so
willingly delay doing so, saying nice little things the
while, did I not know that this would be mere cowardice.
Whatever happens I won't be a coward, and therefore I will
tell you at once that I cannot let you hope that we should
be married this year. Of course you will ask me why,
as you have a right to do, and of course I am bound to
answer. I do not know that I can give any answer with
which you will not have a right to complain. If it be so,
I can only ask your pardon for the injury I am doing you.

<p/>Marriage is a great change in life,--much greater to me
than to you, who will remain in your old house, will keep
your old pursuits, will still be your own master, and will
change in nothing,--except in this, that you will have a
companion who probably may not be all that you expect.
But I must change everything. It will be to me as though
I were passing through a grave to a new world. I shall
see nothing that I have been accustomed to see, and must
abandon all the ways of life that I have hitherto adopted.
Of course I should have thought of this before I accepted
you; and I did think of it. I made up my mind that, as I
truly loved you, I would risk the change;--that I would
risk it for your sake and for mine, hoping that I might
add something to your happiness, and that I might secure
my own. Dear John, do not suppose that I despair that it
may be so; but, indeed, you must not hurry me. I must tune
myself to the change that I have to make. What if I should
wake some morning after six months living with you, and
tell you that the quiet of your home was making me mad?

<p/>You must not ask me again till the winter shall have
passed away. If in the meantime I shall find that I have
been wrong, I will humbly confess that I have wronged
you, and ask you to forgive me. And I will freely admit
this. If the delay which I now purpose is so contrary
to your own plans as to make your marriage, under such
circumstances, not that which you had expected, I know
that you are free to tell me so, and to say that our
engagement shall be over. I am well aware that I can have
no right to bind you to a marriage at one period which you
had only contemplated as to take place at another period.
I think I may promise that I will obey any wish you may
express in anything,--except in that one thing which you
urged in your last letter.

<p/>Kate is going down to Yarmouth with Mrs. Greenow, and I
shall see no more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) probably till next year, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
will be due in Westmoreland after that. George left me at
the door when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brought me home, and declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
intended to vanish out of London. Whether in town or out,
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is never to be seen at this period of the year. Papa
offers to go to Ramsgate for a fortnight, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) looks so
wretched when he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) makes the offer, that I shall not have
the heart to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) to it. Lady Macleod very much wants
me to go to Cheltenham. I very much want not to go, simply
because I can never agree with her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) about anything; but
it will probably end in my going there for a week or two.
Over and beyond that, I have no prospects before Christmas
which are not purely domestic. There is a project that we
shall all eat our Christmas dinner at Vavasor Hall,--of
course not including George,--but this project is quite
in the clouds, and, as far as I am concerned, will remain
there.

<p/>Dear John, let me hear that this letter does not make you
unhappy.

<p/>Most affectionately yours,

<p/>ALICE VAVASOR.


<p/>At Nethercoats, the post was brought in at breakfast-time, and Mr.
Grey was sitting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) tea and eggs before him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) read
Alice's letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) read it twice before he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) began to think what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
would do in regard to it, and then referred to one or two others
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had received from Switzerland,--reading them also very
carefully. After that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) took up the slouch hat which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had been
wearing in the garden before he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was called to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) breakfast, and,
with the letters in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) hand, sauntered down among the shrubs and
lawns.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) knew, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) knew, that there was more in Alice's mind than
a mere wish for delay. There was more in it than that hesitation to
take at once a step which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) really desired to take, if not now,
then after some short interval. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was unhappy, and
unhappy because she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) distrusted the results of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) marriage; but it
never for a moment occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) that, therefore, the engagement
between them should be broken. In the first place he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) too
well to allow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) admitting such an idea without terrible sorrow
to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was a constant, firm man, somewhat reserved, and
unwilling to make new acquaintances, and, therefore, specially
unwilling to break away from those which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had made. Undoubtedly,
had he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) satisfied himself that Alice's happiness demanded such a
sacrifice of himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would have made it, and made it without a
word of complaint. The blow would not have prostrated him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), but the
bruise would have remained on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) heart, indelible, not to be healed
but by death. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would have submitted, and no man would have seen
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had been injured. But it did not once occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) that such
a proceeding on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) part would be beneficial to Alice. Without being
aware of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) reckoned himself to be the nobler creature of the
two, and now thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) as of one wounded, and wanting a cure.
Some weakness had fallen on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and strength must be given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
from another. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) did not in the least doubt her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) love, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) knew
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been associated, for a few weeks past, with two persons
whose daily conversation would be prone to weaken the tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) no more thought of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) up than a man thinks of having
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg cut off because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has sprained his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sinews. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would go up to
town and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and would not even yet abandon all hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
might be found sitting at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) board when Christmas should come. By
that day's post he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrote a short note to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dearest Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, ``I have resolved to go to London at once. I
will be with you in the evening at eight, the day after to-morrow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yours, J. G.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no more in the letter than that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) received it, <div class="bookquote">``I must dare to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>J.</b></font>)
the whole truth.''




 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XI.

<p/>John Grey Goes to London.


<p/>And what was the whole truth? Alice Vavasor, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) declared to
herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) must tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) lover the whole truth, was expressing
to herself her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) intention of putting an end to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) engagement with Mr.
Grey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was acknowledging that that which had to be told was not
compatible with the love and perfect faith which she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) owed to the man
who was her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) affianced husband. And yet, why should it be so? She (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) did
not intend to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had been false in her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) love to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
It was not that her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) heart had again veered itself round and given
itself to that wild cousin of hers. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) might feel herself
constrained to part from John Grey, George Vavasor could never be her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
husband. Of that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) assured herself fifty times during the two days'
grace which had been allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>). Nay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) went farther than that
with herself, and pronounced a verdict against any marriage as
possible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) now decided against this marriage which had
for some months past been regarded as fixed by herself and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
friends.

<p/>People often say that marriage is an important thing, and should be
much thought of in advance, and marrying people are cautioned that
there are many who marry in haste and repent at leisure. I am not
sure, however, that marriage may not be pondered over too much; nor
do I feel certain that the leisurely repentance does not as often
follow the leisurely marriages as it does the rapid ones. That some
repent no one can doubt; but I am inclined to believe that most men
and women take their lots as they find them, marrying as the birds
do by force of nature, and going on with their mates with a general,
though not perhaps an undisturbed satisfaction, feeling inwardly
assured that Providence, if it have not done the very best for them,
has done for them as well as they could do for themselves with all
the thought in the world. I do not know that a woman can assure to
herself, by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own prudence and taste, a good husband any more than
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can add two cubits to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stature; but husbands have been made
to be decently good,--and wives too, for the most part, in our
country,--so that the thing does not require quite so much thinking
as some people say.

<p/>That Alice Vavasor had thought too much about it, I feel quite sure.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had gone on thinking of it till she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had filled herself with a
cloud of doubts which even the sunshine of love was unable to drive
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) heavens. That a girl should really love the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) intends
to marry,--that, at any rate, may be admitted. But love generally
comes easily enough. With all her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) doubts Alice never doubted her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) love
for Mr. Grey. Nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) character, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) temper, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
means. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had gone on thinking of the matter till her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mind had
become filled with some undefined idea of the importance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own life. What should a woman do with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life? There had arisen
round her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a flock of learned ladies asking that question, to whom it
seems that the proper answer has never yet occurred. Fall in love,
marry the man, have two children, and live happy ever afterwards.
I maintain that answer has as much wisdom in it as any other that
can be given;--or perhaps more. The advice contained in it cannot,
perhaps, always be followed to the letter; but neither can the advice
of the other kind, which is given by the flock of learned ladies who
ask the question.

<p/>A woman's life is important to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),--as is that of a man to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--not
chiefly in regard to that which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shall do with it. The chief thing
for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to look to is the manner in which that something shall be
done. It is of moment to a young man when entering life to decide
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall make hats or shoes; but not of half the moment that
will be that other decision, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall make good shoes or bad.
And so with a woman;--if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shall have recognised the necessity of
truth and honesty for the purposes of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life, I do not know that
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) need ask herself many questions as to what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will do with it.

<p/>Alice Vavasor was ever asking herself that question, and had by
degrees filled herself with a vague idea that there was a something
to be done; a something over and beyond, or perhaps altogether beside
that marrying and having two children;--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) only knew what it was.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had filled herself, or had been filled by her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) cousins, with an
undefined ambition that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) restless without giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) any real
food for her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) mind. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) told herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would have no scope
for action in that life in Cambridgeshire which Mr. Grey was preparing
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) did not herself know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) meant by action. Had any
one accused her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) of being afraid to separate herself from London
society, she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would have declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) went very little into
society and disliked that little. Had it been whispered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) loved the neighbourhood of the shops, she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would have scorned the
whisperer. Had it been suggested that the continued rattle of the big
city was necessary to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) happiness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would have declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) father had picked out for their residence the quietest street
in London because she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) could not bear noise;--and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) told herself
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) feared to be taken into the desolate calmness of
Cambridgeshire.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) did contrive to find any answer to that question as to what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) should do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) life,--or rather what she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would wish to do
with it if she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) were a free agent, it was generally of a political
nature. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was not so far advanced as to think that women should be
lawyers and doctors, or to wish that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) might have the privilege of
the franchise for herself; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had undoubtedly a hankering after
some second-hand political manoeuvering. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would have liked, I
think, to have been the wife of the leader of a Radical opposition,
in the time when such men were put into prison, and to have kept up
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Radical</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Radical</b></font>) seditious correspondence while he (<font color='blue'><b>Radical</b></font>) lay in the Tower. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
would have carried the answers to him (<font color='blue'><b>Radical</b></font>) inside her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) stays,--and have
made long journeys down into northern parts without any money, if the
cause required it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would have liked to have around her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) ardent
spirits, male or female, who would have talked of <div class="bookquote">``the cause,''  (<font color='red'><b>spirits</b></font>)</div>and
have kept alive in her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) some flame of political fire. As it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
had no cause. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) father's political views were very mild. Lady
Macleod's were deadly conservative. Kate Vavasor was an aspiring
Radical just now, because her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) brother was in the same line; but
during the year of the love-passages between George and Alice, George
Vavasor's politics had been as conservative as you please. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) did not
become a Radical till he (<font color='blue'><b>Radical</b></font>) had quarrelled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Radical</b></font>) grandfather. Now,
indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Radical</b></font>) was possessed of very advanced views,--views with which
Alice felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could sympathize. But what would be the use of
sympathizing down in Cambridgeshire? John Grey had, so to speak, no
politics. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had decided views as to the treatment which the Roman
Senate received from Augustus, and had even discussed with Alice the
conduct of the Girondists at the time of Robespierre's triumph; but
for Manchester and its cares he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) had no apparent solicitude, and had
declared to Alice that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) would not accept a seat in the British
House of Commons if it were offered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) free of expense. What
political enthusiasm could she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) indulge with such a companion down in
Cambridgeshire?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought too much of all this,--and was, if I may say,
over-prudent in calculating the chances of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) happiness and of
his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>). For, to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) credit for what was her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) due, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was quite as
anxious on the latter head as on the former. <div class="bookquote">``I don't care for the
Roman Senate,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would say to herself. <div class="bookquote">``I don't care much for the
Girondists. How am I to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) day after day, night after night,
when we shall be alone together?''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div><p/>No doubt her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tour in Switzerland with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin had had some effect
in making such thoughts stronger now than they had ever been. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
not again learned to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was as firmly sure as ever
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could never love him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) more. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had insulted her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) love; and
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) and again enrolled him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) among her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) dearest
friends, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could never again feel for him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) that passion which a
woman means when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) acknowledges that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is in love. That, as
regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and George Vavasor, was over. But, nevertheless, there
had been a something of romance during those days in Switzerland
which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feared she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would regret when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) found herself settled
at Nethercoats. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) envied Kate. Kate could, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) sister, attach
herself on to George's political career, and obtain from it all that
excitement of life which Alice desired for herself. Alice could not
love her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin and marry him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could do so
without impropriety she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would like to stick close to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) like another
sister, to spend her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) money in aiding his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) career in Parliament as Kate
would do, and trust herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) career into the boat which he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was
to command. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) did not love her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cousin; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) still believed in
him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>),--with a faith which he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) certainly did not deserve.

<p/>As the two days passed over her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mind grew more and more fixed as
to its purpose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would tell Mr. Grey that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was not fit to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
wife--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would beg him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) to pardon her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) and to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). It never
occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) that perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) might refuse to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) go. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) felt
quite sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would be free as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had spoken the word
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) intended to speak. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) could speak it with decision she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
would be free, and to attain that decision she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would school herself
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) utmost strength. At one moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) thought of telling all to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) father and of begging him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to break the matter to Mr. Grey; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) father would not understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would be
very hostile to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>),--saying hard, uncomfortable words, which would
probably be spared if the thing were done before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was informed. Nor
would she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) write to Kate, whose letters to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) at this time were full
of wit at the expense of Mrs. Greenow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) would tell Kate as soon as
the thing was done, but not before. That Kate would sympathize with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was quite certain.

<p/>So the two days passed by and the time came at which John Grey was to
be there. As the minute hand on the drawing-room clock came round to
the full hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) heart was beating with a violence
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) could not repress. The thing seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) to assume bigger
dimensions than it had hitherto done. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) began to be aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
was about to be guilty of a great iniquity, when it was too late for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) to change her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) could not bring herself to resolve that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would, on the moment, change her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
could never pardon herself such weakness. But yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) felt herself to
be aware that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) purpose was wicked. When the knock at the door was
at last heard she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) trembled and feared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would almost be unable
to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). Might it be possible that there should yet be a
reprieve for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)? No; it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) step on the stairs, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was
in the room with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said, coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) smile was sweet and loving
as it ever was, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) voice had its usual manly, genial, loving
tone. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) walked across the room Alice felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was a man of
whom a wife might be very proud. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was tall and very handsome, with
brown hair, with bright blue eyes, and a mouth like a god. It was the
beauty of his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) mouth,--beauty which comprised firmness within itself,
that made Alice afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) was still dressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) morning
clothes; but he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) was a man who always seemed to be well dressed. <div class="bookquote">``My
dearest,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) said, advancing across the room, and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew how
to stop herself or him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) arms and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) did not immediately begin about the letter, but placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) upon
the sofa, seating himself by her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) side, and looked into her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face with
loving eyes,--not as though to scrutinize what might be amiss there,
but as though determined to enjoy to the full his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) privilege as a
lover. There was no reproach at any rate in his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) countenance;--none as
yet; nor did it seem that he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) had any cause for fear.
They sat in this way for a moment or two in silence, and during those
moments Alice was summoning up her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) courage to speak. The palpitation
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heart was already gone, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would
speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Though I am very glad to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, at last, <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry
that my letter should have given you the trouble of this journey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Trouble!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Nay, you ought to know that it is no trouble. I
have not enough to do down at Nethercoats to make the running up to
you at any time an unpleasant excitement. So your Swiss journey went
off pleasantly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; it went off very pleasantly.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>This she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said in that tone of
voice which clearly implies that the speaker is not thinking of the
words spoken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Kate has now left you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) is with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt, at the seaside.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I understand;--and your cousin George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never know much of George's movements. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) may be in Town, but I
have not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) since I came back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! that is the way with friends living in London. Unless
circumstances bring them together, they are in fact further apart
than if they lived fifty miles asunder in the country. And he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) managed
to get through all the trouble without losing your luggage for you
very often?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you were to say that we did not lose his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), that would be nearer
the mark. But, John, you have come up to London in this sudden way to
speak to me about my letter to you. Is it not so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly it is so. Certainly I have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have thought much, since, of what I then wrote, very much,--very
much, indeed; and I have learned to feel sure that we had better--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop, Alice; stop a moment, love. Do not speak hurriedly. Shall I
tell you what I learned from your letter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; tell me, if you think it better that you should do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it may be better. I learned, love, that something had been
said or done during your journey,--or perhaps only something thought,
that had made you melancholy, and filled your mind for a while with
those unsubstantial and indefinable regrets for the past which we are
all apt to feel at certain moments of our life. There are few of us
who do not encounter, now and again, some of that irrational spirit
of sadness which, when over-indulged, drives men to madness and
self-destruction. I used to know well what it was before I knew you;
but since I have had the hope of having you in my house, I have
banished it utterly. In that I think I have been stronger than you.
Do not speak under the influence of that spirit till you have thought
whether you, too, cannot banish it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have tried, and it will not be banished.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Try again, Alice. It is a damned spirit, and belongs neither to
heaven nor to earth. Do not say to me the words that you were about
to say till you have wrestled with it manfully. I think I know what
those words were to be. If you love me, those words should not be
spoken. If you do not--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I do not love you, I love no one upon earth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe it. I believe it as I believe in my own love for you. I
trust your love implicitly, Alice. I know that you love me. I think I
can read your mind. Tell me that I may return to Cambridgeshire, and
again plead my cause for an early marriage from thence. I will not
take such speech from you to mean more than it says!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat quiet, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>)--looking full into his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had in
nowise changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mind, but after such words from him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not
know how to declare to him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) resolution. There was something in his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>)
manner that awed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),--and something also that softened her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that I may see you again to-morrow morning in
our usual quiet, loving way, and that I may return home to-morrow
evening. Pronounce a yea to that speech from me, and I will ask for
nothing further.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I cannot do so,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said. And the tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) voice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
spoke, was different to any tone that he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) had heard before from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that melancholy fiend too strong for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) smiled as he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) said
this, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) smiled, he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not attempt to
withdraw it, but sat by him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) in a strange calmness, looking straight
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) into the middle of the room. <div class="bookquote">``You have not struggled with
it. You know, as I do, that it is a bad fiend and a wicked one,--a
fiend that is prompting you to the worst cruelty in the world. Alice!
Alice! Alice! Try to think of all this as though some other person
were concerned. If it were your friend, what advice would you give
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)?''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``If it were your friend, what advice would you give
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would bid her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tell the man who had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),--that is, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were
noble, good, and great,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found herself to be unfit to be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wife; and then I would bid her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ask his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pardon humbly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knees.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sank before him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) on to the floor, and looked up
into his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) face with an expression of sad contrition which almost drew
him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) purposed firmness.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) had purposed to be firm,--to yield to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in nothing, resolving
to treat all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might say as the hallucination of a sickened
imagination,--as the effect of absolute want of health, for which
some change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mode of life would be the best cure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might
bid him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) begone in what language she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would. He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) knew well that such
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) intention. But he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) would not allow a word coming from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in
such a way to disturb arrangements made for the happiness of their
joint lives. As a loving husband would treat a wife, who, in some
exceptionable moment of a melancholy malady, should declare herself
unable to remain longer in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) home, so would he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) treat her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). As for
accepting what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might say as his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dismissal, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would as soon think
of taking the fruit-trees from the southern wall because the sun
sometimes shines from the north. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could not treat either his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
interests or hers so lightly as that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) granted no such pardon, Alice? I will grant none
such. You are my wife, my own, my dearest, my chosen one. You are all
that I value in the world, my treasure and my comfort, my earthly
happiness and my gleam of something better that is to come hereafter.
Do you think that I shall let you go from me in that way? No, love.
If you are ill I will wait till your illness is gone by; and, if you
will let me, I will be your nurse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not ill with any defined sickness. You do not shake with ague, nor
does your head rack you with aching; but yet you may be ill. Think of
what has passed between us. Must you not be ill when you seek to put
an end to all that without any cause assigned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not hear my reasons,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was still kneeling before him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
and looking up into his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will hear them if you will tell me that they refer to any supposed
faults of my own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I will not hear them. It is for me to find out your faults, and
when I have found out any that require complaint, I will come and
make it. Dear Alice, I wish you knew how I long for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) put
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hair, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would caress her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).

<p/>But this she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would not suffer, so she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) rose slowly, and stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
hand upon the table in the middle of the room. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Grey--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will call me so, I shall think it only a part of your
malady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Grey,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``I can only hope that you will take me at
my word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but I will not; certainly I will not, if that would be adverse
to my own interests.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am thinking of your interests; I am, indeed;--at any rate as much
as of my own. I feel quite sure that I should not make you happy as
your wife,--quite sure; and feeling that, I think that I am right,
even after all that has passed, to ask your forgiveness, and to beg
that our engagement may be over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Alice, no; never with my consent. I cannot tell you with what
contentment I would marry you to-morrow,--to-morrow, or next month,
or the month after. But if it cannot be so, then I will wait. Nothing
but your marriage with some one else would convince me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot convince you in that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will convince me in no other. You have not spoken to your father
of this as yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not as yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not do so, at any rate for the present. You will own that it
might be possible that you would have to unsay what you had said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; it is not possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give yourself and me the chance. It can do no harm. And, Alice, I
ask you now for no reasons. I will not ask your reasons, or even
listen to them, because I do not believe that they will long have
effect even on yourself. Do you still think of going to Cheltenham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have decided nothing as yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were you, I would go. I think a change of air would be good for
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; you treat me as though I were partly silly, and partly insane;
but it is not so. The change you speak of should be in my nature, and
in yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) head and still smiled. There was something in the
imperturbed security of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) manner which almost made her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) angry with
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). It seemed as though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) assumed so great a superiority that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
felt himself able to treat any resolve of hers as the petulance of
a child. And though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) spoke in strong language of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) love, and of
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) longing that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should come to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), yet he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was so well able
to command his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) feelings, that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) showed no sign of grief at the
communication she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had made to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did not doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) love, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) believed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to be so much the master of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) love,--as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was the
master of everything else, that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) separation from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would cause
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) no uncontrollable grief. In that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) utterly failed to understand
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) character. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) known him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) better, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might have been sure
that such a separation now would with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) have carried its mark to
the grave. Should he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) submit to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) decision, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would go home and
settle himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) books the next day; but on no following day
would he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) be again capable of walking forth among his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) flowers with an
easy heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was a strong, constant man, perhaps over-conscious of
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own strength; but then his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) strength was great. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is perfect!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice had said to herself often. <div class="bookquote">``Oh that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) were less perfect!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) long after the last word that has been
recorded. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, as for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand at
parting, <div class="bookquote">``I had better not come to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; it is better not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I advise you not to tell your father of this, and doubtless you will
think of it before you do so. But if you do tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), let me know
that you have done so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because in such case I also must see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). God bless you, Alice! God
bless you, dearest, dearest Alice!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat there
on the sofa without moving, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father's feet as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
came up the stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, Alice, are you not in bed yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so John Grey has been here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) has left his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) stick in the hall. I
should know it among a thousand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) has been here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is anything the matter, Alice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, papa, nothing is the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) has not made himself disagreeable, has he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) never does anything wrong. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) may defy man or
woman to find fault with him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So that is it, is it? He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is just a shade too good. Well, I have
always thought that myself. But it's a fault on the right side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no fault, Papa. If there be any fault, it is not with him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>). But

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) returns to Nethercoats early. Good night, papa.''

<p/>CHAPTER XII.

<p/>Mr. George Vavasor at Home.


<p/>It cannot perhaps fairly be said that George Vavasor was an
unhospitable man, seeing that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) custom to entertain his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
friends occasionally at Greenwich, Richmond, or such places; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would now and again have a friend to dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) club.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) never gave breakfasts, dinners, or suppers under his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) own
roof. During a short period of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) wine-selling career, at which
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had occupied handsome rooms over his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) place of business in
New Burlington Street, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had presided at certain feasts given to
customers or expectant customers by the firm; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had not found
this employment to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) taste, and had soon relinquished it to one
of the other partners. Since that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had lived in lodgings in Cecil
Street,--down at the bottom of that retired nook, near to the river
and away from the Strand. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had simply two rooms on the first
floor, and hither his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) friends came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) very rarely. They came very
rarely on any account. A stray man might now and then pass an hour
with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) here; but on such occasions the chances were that the visit
had some reference, near or distant, to affairs of business. Eating
or drinking there was never any to be found here by the most intimate
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) allies. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lodgings were his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) private retreat, and they were
so private that but few of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends knew where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lived.

<p/>And had it been possible he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have wished that no one should have
known his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whereabouts. I am not aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had any special reason
for this peculiarity, or that there was anything about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mode of
life that required hiding; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a man who had always lived as
though secrecy in certain matters might at any time become useful
to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a mode of dressing himself when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went out at night
that made it almost impossible that any one should recognise him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The
people at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lodgings did not even know that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had relatives, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nearest relatives hardly knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had lodgings. Even Kate
had never been at the rooms in Cecil Street, and addressed all her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
letters to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) place of business or his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) club. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was a man who would
bear no inquiry into himself. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) had been out of view for a month,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) friends asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) had been, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) always answered the
question falsely, or left it unanswered. There are many men of whom
everybody knows all about all their belongings;--as to whom everybody
knows where they live, whither they go, what is their means, and how
they spend it. But there are others of whom no man knows anything,
and George Vavasor was such a one. For myself I like the open babbler
the best. Babbling may be a weakness, but to my thinking mystery is a
vice.

<p/>Vavasor also maintained another little establishment, down in
Oxfordshire; but the two establishments did not even know of each
other's existence. There was a third, too, very closely hidden from
the world's eye, which shall be nameless; but of the establishment in
Oxfordshire he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) did sometimes speak, in very humble words, among his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
friends. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) found himself among hunting men, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would speak of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) two nags at Roebury, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had never yet been able to
mount a regular hunting stable, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) never would;
but that there were at Roebury two indifferent beasts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) if any
one chose to buy them. And men very often did buy Vavasor's horses.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was on them they always went well and sold themselves
readily. And though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) thus spoke of two, and perhaps did not keep
more during the summer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) always seemed to have horses enough when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was down in the country. No one even knew George Vavasor not to
hunt because he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was short of stuff. And here, at Roebury, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) kept
a trusty servant, an ancient groom with two little bushy grey eyes
which looked as though they could see through a stable door. Many
were the long whisperings which George and Bat Smithers carried on
at the stable door, in the very back depth of the yard attached to
the hunting inn at Roebury. Bat regarded his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) master as a man wholly
devoted to horses, but often wondered why he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was not more regular in
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sojournings in Oxfordshire. Of any other portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) master's
life Bat knew nothing. Bat could give the address of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) master's
club in London, but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could give no other address.

<p/>But though Vavasor's private lodgings were so very private, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had,
nevertheless, taken some trouble in adorning them. The furniture in
the sitting-room was very neat, and the book-shelves were filled
with volumes that shone with gilding on their backs. The inkstand,
the paper-weight, the envelope case on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) writing-table were all
handsome. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had a single good portrait of a woman's head hanging on
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) walls. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had a special place adapted for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pistols,
others for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) foils, and again another for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) whips. The room was
as pretty a bachelor's room as you would wish to enter, but you
might see, by the position of the single easy-chair that was brought
forward, that it was seldom appropriated to the comfort of more than
one person. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sat lounging over his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) breakfast, late on a Sunday
morning in September, when all the world was out of town. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was
reading a letter which had just been brought down to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
club. Though the writer of it was his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sister Kate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had not been
privileged to address it to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) private lodgings. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) read it very
quickly, running rapidly over its contents, and then threw it aside
from him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) as though it were of no moment, keeping, however, an
enclosure in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand. And yet the letter was of much moment, and
made him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) think deeply. <div class="bookquote">``If I did it at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it would be
more with the object of cutting him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) out than with any other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The reader will hardly require to be told that the him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) in question
was John Grey, and that Kate's letter was one instigating her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother
to renew his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) love affair with Alice. And Vavasor was in truth well
inclined to renew it, and would have begun the renewing it at once,
had he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) not doubted his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) power with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) cousin. Indeed it has been seen
that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had already attempted some commencement of such renewal at
Basle. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had told Kate more than once that Alice's fortune was not
much, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) beauty was past its prime; and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would no doubt
repeat the same objections to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister with some pretence of
disinclination. It was not his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) custom to show his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hand to the players
at any game that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) played. But he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was, in truth, very anxious to
obtain from Alice a second promise of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand. How soon after that
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), would be another question.

<p/>Perhaps it was not Alice's beauty that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) coveted, nor yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) money
exclusively. Nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) very beautiful, and was
fully aware that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) money would be of great service to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). But I
believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was true in that word that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) spoke to himself, and
that his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) chief attraction was the delight which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would have in
robbing Mr. Grey of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) wife. Alice had once been his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) love, had
clung to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) side, had whispered love to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had enough of
the weakness of humanity in him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) to feel the soreness arising from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) affection for another. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) broke away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had
acknowledged that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had been wrong, and when, since her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) engagement
with Mr. Grey, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had congratulated her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) quiet,
half-whispered, impressive words how right she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was; but not the less,
therefore, did he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) feel himself hurt that John Grey should be her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
lover. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had met this man he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had spoken well of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) sister, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was a gentleman, a scholar, and a man
of parts; but not the less had he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) from the first moment
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). Such hatred under such circumstances was almost
pardonable. But George Vavasor, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) hated, was apt to follow up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) hatred with injury. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) could not violently dislike a man and yet
not wish to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) any harm. At present, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) sat lounging in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
chair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would like to marry his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) cousin Alice; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was quite sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would like to be the means of putting a
stop to the proposed marriage between Alice and John Grey.

<p/>Kate had been very false to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) friend, and had sent up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
brother the very letter which Alice had written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) after that
meeting in Queen Anne Street which was described in the last
chapter,--or rather a portion of it, for with the reserve common to
women she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had kept back the other half. Alice had declared to herself
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would be sure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin's sympathy, and had written out
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heart on the matter, as was her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wont when writing to Kate.
<div class="bookquote">``But you must understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wrote, <div class="bookquote">``that all that I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
went with him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) for nothing. I had determined to make him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) know that
everything between us must be over, but I failed. I found that I had
no words at command, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) was able to talk to me as though I
were a child. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) told me that I was sick and full of phantasies, and
bade me change the air. As he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) spoke in this way, I could not help
feeling how right he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) was to use me so; but I felt also that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>),
in his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) mighty superiority, could never be a fitting husband for a
creature so inferior to him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) as I am. Though I altogether failed
to make him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) understand that it was so, every moment that we were
together made me more fixed in my resolution.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This letter from Alice to Kate, Vavasor read over and over again,
though Kate's letter to himself, which was the longer one, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had
thrown aside after the first glance. There was nothing that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) could
learn from that. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was as good a judge of the manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
would play his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) own game as Kate could be; but in this matter he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was
to learn how he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would play his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) game from a knowledge of the other
girl's mind. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'ll never marry him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said to
himself, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is right. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'d make an upper servant of her (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>); very
respectable, no doubt, but still only an upper servant. Now with
me;--well, I hardly know what I should make of her (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>). I cannot think of
myself as a man married.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) threw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) letter after Kate's, and
betook himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) newspaper and his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) cigar.

<p/>It was two hours after this, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) still wore his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) dressing-gown, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was still lounging in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) easy-chair, when the waiting-maid at
the lodgings brought him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) up word that a gentleman wished to see him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).
Vavasor kept no servant of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) own except that confidential groom
down at Bicester. It was a rule with him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) that people could be better
served and cheaper served by other people's servants than by their
own. Even in the stables at Bicester the innkeeper had to find what
assistance was wanted, and charge for it in the bill. And George
Vavasor was no Sybarite. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) did not deem it impracticable to put on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) own trousers without having a man standing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) foot to hold up
the leg of the garment. A valet about a man knows a great deal of a
man's ways, and therefore George had no valet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A gentleman!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to the girl. <div class="bookquote">``Does the gentleman look like a
public-house keeper?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) do,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then show him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) up,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/>And the gentleman was a public-house keeper. Vavasor was pretty sure
of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) visitor before he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) desired the servant to give him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) entrance.
It was Mr. Grimes from the <div class="bookquote">``Handsome Man''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimes/Grimes</b></font>)</div>public-house and tavern, in
the Brompton Road, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) had come by appointment to have a little
conversation with Mr. Vavasor on matters political. Mr. Grimes was
a man who knew that business was business, and as such had some
considerable weight in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) own neighbourhood. With him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) politics was
business, as well as beer, and omnibus-horses, and foreign wines;--in
the fabrication of which latter article Mr. Grimes was supposed
to have an extended experience. To such as him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>), when intent on
business, Mr. Vavasor was not averse to make known the secrets of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
lodging-house; and now, when the idle of London world was either at
morning church or still in bed, Mr. Grimes had come out by appointment
to do a little political business with the lately-rejected member for
the Chelsea Districts.

<p/>Vavasor had been, as I have said, lately rejected, and the new member
who had beaten him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) at the hustings had sat now for one session in
parliament. Under his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) present reign he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) was destined to the honour of
one other session, and then the period of his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) existing glory,--for
which he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) was said to have paid nearly six thousand pounds,--would be
over. But he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) might be elected again, perhaps for a full period of six
sessions; and it might be hoped that this second election would be
conducted on more economical principles. To this, the economical view
of the matter, Mr. Grimes was very much opposed, and was now waiting
upon George Vavasor in Cecil Street, chiefly with the object of
opposing the new member's wishes on this head. No doubt Mr. Grimes was
personally an advocate for the return of Mr. Vavasor, and would do all
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) power to prevent the re-election of the young Lord Kilfenora,
whose father, the Marquis of Bunratty, had scattered that six
thousand pounds among the electors and non-electors of Chelsea; but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) main object was that money should be spent. <div class="bookquote">''`Tain't altogether
for myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the electors non-electors</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) said to a confidential friend in the same way of
business; <div class="bookquote">``I don't get so much on it. Perhaps sometimes not none. May
be I've a bill agin some of those gents not paid this werry moment.
But it's the game I looks to. If the game dies away, it'll never be
got up again;--never. Who'll care about elections then? Anybody'd go
and get hisself elected if we was to let the game go by!''  (<font color='red'><b>a friend</b></font>)</div>And so,
that the game might not go by, Mr. Grimes was now present in Mr. George
Vavasor's rooms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well Mr. Grimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George, <div class="bookquote">``how are you this morning? Sit down,
Mr. Grimes. If every man were as punctual as you are, the world would
go like clock-work; wouldn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Business is business, Mr. Vavasor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the publican</b></font>)</div>said the publican, after having
made his (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) salute, and having taken his (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) chair with some little show of
mock modesty. <div class="bookquote">``That's my maxim. If I didn't stick to that, nothing
wouldn't ever stick to me; and nothing doesn't much as it is. Times
is very bad, Mr. Vavasor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course they are. They're always bad. What was the Devil made
for, except that they should be bad? But I should have thought you
publicans were the last men who ought to complain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord love you, Mr. Vavasor; why, I suppose of all the men as is put
upon, we're put upon the worst. What's the good of drawing of beer,
if the more you draw the more you don't make. Yesterday as ever was
was Saturday, and we drawed three pound ten and nine. What'll that
come to, Mr. Vavasor, when you reckons it up with the brewer? Why,
it's a next to nothing. You knows that well enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word I don't. But I know you don't sell a pint of beer
without getting a profit out of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord love you, Mr. Vavasor. If I hadn't nothink to look to but beer I
couldn't keep a house over my head; no I couldn't. That house of mine
belongs to Meux's people; and very good people they are too;--have
made a sight of money; haven't they, Mr. Vavasor? I has to get my beer
from them in course. Why not, when it's their house? But if I sells
their stuff as I gets it, there ain't a halfpenny coming to me out of
a gallon. Look at that, now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But then you don't sell it as you get it. You stretch it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``That's in course. I'm not going to tell you a lie, Mr. Vavasor. You
know what's what as well as I do, and a sight better, I expect.
There's a dozen different ways of handling beer, Mr. Vavasor. But
what's the use of that, when they can take four or five pounds a day
over the counter for their rot-gut stuff at the ``Cadogan Arms,<div class="bookquote">'' and I
can't do no better nor yet perhaps so well, for a real honest glass
of beer. Stretch it! It's my belief the more you poison their liquor,
the more the people likes it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimes/Grimes</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Grimes was a stout man, not very tall, with a mottled red face,
and large protruding eyes. As regards his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) own person, Mr. Grimes
might have been taken as a fair sample of the English innkeeper,
as described for many years past. But in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) outer garments he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) was
very unlike that description. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) wore a black, swallow-tailed coat,
made, however, to set very loose upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) back, a black waistcoat,
and black pantaloons. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) carried, moreover, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) hands a black
chimney-pot hat. Not only have the top-boots and breeches vanished
from the costume of innkeepers, but also the long, particoloured
waistcoat, and the birds'-eye fogle round their necks. They get
themselves up to look like Dissenting ministers or undertakers,
except that there is still a something about their rosy gills which
tells a tale of the spigot and corkscrew.

<p/>Mr. Grimes had only just finished the tale of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) own hard ways as a
publican, when the door-bell was again rung. <div class="bookquote">``There's Scruby,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said
George Vavasor, <div class="bookquote">``and now we can go to business.''




 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XIII.

<p/>Mr. Grimes Gets His (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) Odd Money.


<p/>The handmaiden at George Vavasor's lodgings announced <div class="bookquote">``another gent,''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>and then Mr. Scruby entered the room in which were seated George, and
Mr. Grimes the publican from the <div class="bookquote">``Handsome Man''  (<font color='red'><b>the publican</b></font>)</div>on the Brompton Road.
Mr. Scruby was an attorney from Great Marlborough Street, supposed to
be very knowing in the ways of metropolitan elections; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) had now
stepped round, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) called it, with the object of saying a few words
to Mr. Grimes, partly on the subject of the forthcoming contest at
Chelsea, and partly on that of the contest last past. These words
were to be said in the presence of Mr. Vavasor, the person interested.
That some other words had been spoken between Mr. Scruby and Mr. Grimes
on the same subjects behind Mr. Vavasor's back I think very probable.
But even though this might have been so I am not prepared to say that
Mr. Vavasor had been deceived by their combinations.

<p/>The two men were very civil to each other in their salutations, the
attorney assuming an air of patronizing condescension, always calling
the other Grimes; whereas Mr. Scruby was treated with considerable
deference by the publican, and was always called Mr. Scruby. <div class="bookquote">``Business
is business,''  (<font color='red'><b>the publican</b></font>)</div>said the publican as soon as these salutations were
over; <div class="bookquote">``isn't it now, Mr. Scruby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the publican</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I suppose Grimes thinks Sunday morning a particularly good time
for business,''  (<font color='red'><b>the attorney</b></font>)</div>said the attorney, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's quiet, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimes/Grimes</b></font>)</div>said Grimes. <div class="bookquote">``But it warn't me as named
Sunday morning. It was Mr. Vavasor here. But it is quiet; ain't it,
Mr. Scruby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Scruby acknowledged that it was quiet, especially looking out
over the river, and then they proceeded to business. <div class="bookquote">``We must pull
the governor through better next time than we did last,''  (<font color='red'><b>the attorney</b></font>)</div>said the
attorney.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course we must, Mr. Scruby; but, Lord love you, Mr. Vavasor,
whose fault was it? What notice did I get,--just tell me that? Why,
Travers's name was up on the liberal interest ever so long before the
governor had ever thought about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody is blaming you, Mr. Grimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And nobody can't, Mr. Vavasor. I done my work true as steel, and
there ain't another man about the place as could have done half
as much. You ask Mr. Scruby else. Mr. Scruby knows, if ere a man in
London does. I tell you what it is, Mr. Vavasor, them Chelsea fellows,
who lives mostly down by the river, ain't like your Maryboners or
Finsburyites. It wants something of a man to manage them. Don't it Mr.
Scruby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It wants something of a man to manage any of them as far as my
experience goes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Scruby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it do; and there ain't one in London knows so much about
it as you do, Mr. Scruby. I will say that for you. But the long and
the short of it is this;--business is business, and money is money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Money is money, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Scruby. <div class="bookquote">``There's no doubt in the
world about that, Grimes;--and a deal of it you had out of the last
election.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I hadn't; begging your pardon, Mr. Scruby, for making so free.
What I had to my own cheek wasn't nothing to speak of. I wasn't paid
for my time; that's what I wasn't. You look how a publican's business
gets cut up at them elections;--and then the state of the house
afterwards! What would the governor say to me if I was to put down
painting inside and out in my little bill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't seem to make much difference how you put it down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said
Vavasor. <div class="bookquote">``The total is what I look at.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so, Mr. Vavasor; just so. The total is what I looks at too. And
I has to look at it a deuced long time before I gets it. I ain't a
got it yet; have I, Mr. Vavasor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; if you ask me I should say you had,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``I know I
paid Mr. Scruby three hundred pounds on your account.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I got every shilling of it, Mr. Vavasor. I'm not a going to deny
the money, Mr. Vavasor. You'll never find me doing that. I'm as round
as your hat, and as square as your elbow,--I am. Mr. Scruby knows me;
don't you, Mr. Scruby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I know you too well, Grimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No you don't, Mr. Scruby; not a bit too well. Nor I don't know you
too well, either. I respect you, Mr. Scruby, because you're a man as
understands your business. But as I was saying, what's three hundred
pounds when a man's bill is three hundred and ninety-two thirteen and
fourpence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought that was all settled, Mr. Scruby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why you see, Mr. Vavasor, it's very hard to settle these things. If
you ask me whether Mr. Grimes here can sue you for the balance, I tell
you very plainly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) can't. We were a little short of money when
we came to a settlement, as is generally the case at such times, and
so we took Mr. Grimes' receipt for three hundred pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you did, Mr. Scruby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not on account, but in full of all demands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now Mr. Scruby!''  (<font color='red'><b>the publican</b></font>)</div>and the publican as he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) made this appeal looked at
the attorney with an expression of countenance which was absolutely
eloquent. <div class="bookquote">``Are you going to put me off with such an excuse as that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>so the look spoke plainly enough. <div class="bookquote">``Are you going to bring up my own
signature against me, when you know very well that I shouldn't have
got a shilling at all for the next twelve months if I hadn't given
it? Oh Mr. Scruby!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimes/Grimes</b></font>)</div>That's what Mr. Grimes' look said, and both Mr.
Scruby and Mr. Vavasor understood it perfectly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In full of all demands,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Scruby, with a slight tone of
triumph in his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) voice, as though to show that Grimes' appeal had no
effect at all upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) conscience. <div class="bookquote">``If you were to go into a court
of law, Grimes, you wouldn't have a leg to stand upon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A court of law? Who's a going to law with the governor, I should
like to know? not I; not if he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) didn't pay me them ninety-two pounds
thirteen and fourpence for the next five years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Five years or fifteen would make no difference,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Scruby. <div class="bookquote">``You
couldn't do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I ain't a going to try. That's not the ticket I've come here
about, Mr. Vavasor, this blessed Sunday morning. Going to law, indeed!
But Mr. Scruby, I've got a family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the vale of Taunton, I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/>``They is at the <div class="bookquote">``Handsome Man' in the Brompton Road, Mr. Vavasor; and
I always feels that I owes my first duty to them. If a man don't work
for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family, what do he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, Grimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Scruby. <div class="bookquote">``What is it you're at? Out with
it, and don't keep us here all day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it I'm at, Mr. Scruby? As if you didn't know very well
what I'm at. There's my house;--in all them Chelsea districts it's
the most convenientest of any public as is open for all manner of
election purposes. That's given up to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what next?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Scruby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The next is, I myself. There isn't one of the lot of 'em can work
them Chelsea fellows down along the river unless it is me. Mr. Scruby
knows that. Why I've been a getting of them up with a view to this
very job ever since;--why ever since they was a talking of the
Chelsea districts. When Lord Robert was a coming in for the county
on the religious dodge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) couldn't have worked them fellows anyhow,
only for me. Mr. Scruby knows that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's take it all for granted, Mr. Grimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor. <div class="bookquote">``What comes
next?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well;--them Bunratty people; it is they as has come next. They know
which side their bread is likely to be buttered; they do. They're a
bidding for the <div class="bookquote">``Handsome Man' already; they are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you'd let your house to the Tory party, Grimes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Scruby,
in a tone in which disgust and anger were blended.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who said anything of my letting my house to the Tory party, Mr.
Scruby? I'm as round as your hat, Mr. Scruby, and as square as your
elbow; I am. But suppose as all the liberal gents as employs you,
Mr. Scruby, was to turn again you and not pay you your little bills,
wouldn't you have your eyes open for customers of another kind? Come
now, Mr. Scruby?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't make much of that game, Grimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not; perhaps not. There's a risk in all these things; isn't
there, Mr. Vavasor? I should like to see you a Parliament gent; I
should indeed. You'd be a credit to the districts; I really think you
would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm much obliged by your good opinion, Mr. Grimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I sees a gent coming forward I knows whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>)'s fit for
Parliament, or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) ain't. I says you are fit. But Lord love
you, Mr. Vavasor; it's a thing a gentleman always has to pay for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true enough; a deal more than it's worth, generally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A thing's worth what it fetches. I'm worth what I'll fetch; that's
the long and the short of it. I want to have my balance, that's the
truth. It's the odd money in a man's bill as always carries the
profit. You ask Mr. Scruby else;--only with a lawyer it's all profit I
believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what you know about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Scruby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you cut off a man's odd money,''  (<font color='red'><b>the publican</b></font>)</div>continued the publican, <div class="bookquote">``you
break his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d almost sooner have that and leave the other
standing. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d call the hundreds capital, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lost them at
last, why he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d put it down as being in the way of trade. But the odd
money;--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looks at that, Mr. Vavasor, as in a manner the very sweat
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) brow, the work of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) own hand; that's what goes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
family, and keeps the pot a boiling down-stairs. Never stop a man's
odd money, Mr. Vavasor; that is, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) comes it very strong
indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the publican</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is it you want now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Scruby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wants ninety-two pounds thirteen and fourpence, Mr. Scruby, and
then we'll go to work for the new fight with contented hearts. If
we're to begin at all, it's quite time; it is indeed, Mr. Vavasor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what you mean us to understand is, that you won't begin at all
without your money,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said the lawyer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's about it, Mr. Scruby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take a fifty-pound note, Grimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said the lawyer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fifty-pound notes are not so ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>)'ll be only too happy to have your acceptance; won't you,
Grimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for fifty pounds, Mr. Scruby. It's the odd money that I wants.
I don't mind the thirteen and four, because that's neither here nor
there among friends, but if I didn't get all them ninety-two pounds
I should be a broken-hearted man; I should indeed, Mr. Vavasor. I
couldn't go about your work for next year so as to do you justice
among the electors. I couldn't indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better give him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) a bill for ninety pounds at three months, Mr.
Vavasor. I have no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) has got a stamp in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) pocket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I have, Mr. Scruby; there ain't no mistake about that. A bill
stamp is a thing that often turns up convenient with gents as mean
business like Mr. Vavasor and you. But you must make it ninety-two;
you must indeed, Mr. Vavasor. And do make it two months if you can,
Mr. Vavasor; they do charge so unconscionable on ninety days at them
branch banks; they do indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>George Vavasor and Mr. Scruby, between them, yielded at last, so far
as to allow the bill to be drawn for ninety-two pounds, but they were
stanch as to the time. <div class="bookquote">``If it must be, it must,''  (<font color='red'><b>the publican</b></font>)</div>said the publican,
with a deep sigh, as he (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) folded up the paper and put it into the
pocket of a huge case which he (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) carried. ``And now, gents, I'll tell
you what it is. We'll make safe work of this here next election. We
know what's to be our little game in time, and if we don't go in and
win, my name ain't Jacob Grimes, and I ain't the landlord of the
``Handsome Man.<div class="bookquote">'' As you gents has perhaps got something to say among
yourselves, I'll make so bold as to wish you good morning.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Man</b></font>)</div>So, with
that, Mr. Grimes lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) hat from the floor, and bowed himself out
of the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You couldn't have done it cheaper; you couldn't, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said the
lawyer, as soon as the sound of the closing front door had been
heard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not; but what a thief the man is! I remember your telling me
that the bill was about the most preposterous you had ever seen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it was, and if we hadn't wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again of course we shouldn't
have paid him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But we'll have it all off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) next account, Mr.
Vavasor,--every shilling of it, It's only lent; that's all;--it's
only lent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But one doesn't want to lend such a man money, if one could help
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true. If you look at it in that light, it's quite true. But
you see we cannot do without him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hadn't got your bill, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d
have gone over to the other fellows before the week was over; and the
worst of it would have been that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows our hand. Looking at it all
round you've got him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheap, Mr. Vavasor;--you have, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Looking at it all round is just what I don't like, Mr. Scruby, But if
a man will have a whistle, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must pay for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't do it cheap for any of these metropolitan seats; you
can't, indeed, Mr. Vavasor. That is, a new man can't. When you've
been in four or five times, like old Duncombe, why then, of course,
you may snap your fingers at such men as Grimes. But the Chelsea
districts ain't dear. I don't call them by any means dear. Now
Marylebone is dear,--and so is Southwark. It's dear, and nasty;
that's what the borough is. Only that I never tell tales, I could
tell you a tale, Mr. Vavasor, that'd make your hair stand on end; I
could indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! the game is hardly worth the candle, I believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends on what way you choose to look at it. A seat in
Parliament is a great thing to a man who wants to make his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way;--a
very great thing;--specially when a man's young, like you, Mr.
Vavasor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Young!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``Sometimes it seems to me as though I've been
living for a hundred years. But I won't trouble you with that, Mr.
Scruby, and I believe I needn't keep you any longer.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With that, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
got up and bowed the attorney out of the room, with just a little
more ceremony than he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had shown to the publican.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Young!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor to himself, when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was left alone. <div class="bookquote">``There's
my uncle, or the old squire,--they're both younger men than I am.
One cares for his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) dinner, and the other for his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) bullocks and his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
trees. But what is there that I care for, unless it is not getting
among the sheriff's officers for debt?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) took out a little
memorandum-book from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) breast-pocket, and having made in it an
entry as to the amount and date of that bill which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had just
accepted on the publican's behalf, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) conned over the particulars of
its pages. <div class="bookquote">``Very blue; very blue, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said to himself when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
had completed the study. <div class="bookquote">``But nobody shall say I hadn't the courage
to play the game out, and that old fellow must die some day, one
supposes. If I were not a fool, I should make it up with him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) before
he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) went; but I am a fool, and shall remain so to the last.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Soon
after that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) dressed himself slowly, reading a little every now and
then as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did so. When his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) toilet was completed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) Sunday
newspapers sufficiently perused, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hat and umbrella and
sauntered out.




<p/>CHAPTER XIV.

<p/>Alice Vavasor Becomes Troubled.


<p/>Kate Vavasor had sent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) brother only the first half of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
cousin's letter, that half in which Alice had attempted to describe
what had taken place between her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) and Mr. Grey. In doing this, Kate
had been a wicked traitor,--a traitor to that feminine faith against
which treason on the part of one woman is always unpardonable in
the eyes of other women. But her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) treason would have been of a deeper
die had she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sent the latter portion, for in that Alice had spoken
of George Vavasor himself. But even of this treason, Kate would, I
think, have been guilty, had the words which Alice wrote been of a
nature to serve her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own purpose if read by her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) brother. But they had
not been of this nature. They had spoken of George as a man with
whom any closer connection than that which existed at present was
impossible, and had been written with the view of begging Kate to
desist from making futile attempts in that direction. <div class="bookquote">``I feel myself
driven,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice had said, <div class="bookquote">``to write all this, as otherwise,--if I were
simply to tell you that I have resolved to part from Mr. Grey,--you
would think that the other thing might follow. The other thing cannot
follow. I should think myself untrue in my friendship to you if I did
not tell you about Mr. Grey; and you will be untrue in your friendship
to me if you take advantage of my confidence by saying more about
your brother.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>This part of Alice's letter Kate had not sent to
George Vavasor;--<div class="bookquote">``But the other thing shall follow,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Kate had said,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) read the words for the second time, and then put the papers
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) desk. <div class="bookquote">``It shall follow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/>To give Kate Vavasor her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) due, she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was, at any rate, unselfish in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) intrigues. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was obstinately persistent, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was moreover
unscrupulous, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was not selfish. Many years ago she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had made
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) mind that George and Alice should be man and wife, feeling
that such a marriage would be good at any rate for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) brother. It
had been almost brought about, and had then been hindered altogether
through a fault on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) brother's part. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) this
sin as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had forgiven many others, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was now at work in
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) behalf again, determined that they two should be married, even
though neither of them might be now anxious that it should be so. The
intrigue itself was dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and success in it was necessary to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) self-respect.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) answered Alice's letter with a pleasant, gossiping epistle, which
shall be recorded, as it will tell us something of Mrs. Greenow's
proceedings at Yarmouth. Kate had promised to stay at Yarmouth for a
month, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had already been there six weeks, and was still under
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt's wing.


<p/>Yarmouth, October, 186--.

<p/>DEAREST ALICE,

<p/>Of course I am delighted. It is no good saying that I am
not. I know how difficult it is to deal with you, and
therefore I sit down to answer your letter with fear and
trembling, lest I should say a word too much, and thereby
drive you back, or not say quite enough and thereby fail
to encourage you on. Of course I am glad. I have long
thought that Mr. Grey could not make you happy, and as
I have thought so, how can I not be glad? It is no use
saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) is good and noble, and all that sort of
thing. I have never denied it. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was not suited to
you, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) life would have made you wretched. Ergo, I
rejoice. And as you are the dearest friend I have, of
course I rejoice mightily.

<p/>I can understand accurately the sort of way in which
the interview went. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had the best of it.
I can see him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) so plainly as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) stood up in unruffled
self-possession, ignoring all that you said, suggesting
that you were feverish or perhaps bilious, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
hand over you a little, as though that might possibly do
you some small good, and then taking his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) leave with an
assurance that it would be all right as soon as the wind
changed. I suppose it's very noble in him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), not taking you
at your word, and giving you, as it were, another chance;
but there is a kind of nobility which is almost too great
for this world. I think very well of you, my dear, as
women go, but I do not think well enough of you to believe
that you are fit to be Mr. John Grey's wife.

<p/>Of course I'm very glad. You have known my mind from the
first to the last, and, therefore, what would be the good
of my mincing matters? No woman wishes her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dearest friend
to marry a man to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) herself is antipathetic. You
would have been as much lost to me, had you become Mrs.
Grey of Nethercoats, Cambridgeshire, as though you had
gone to heaven. I don't say but what Nethercoats may be a
kind of heaven,--but then one doesn't wish one's friend
that distant sort of happiness. A flat Eden I can fancy
it, hemmed in by broad dykes, in which cream and eggs are
very plentiful, where an Adam and an Eve might drink the
choicest tea out of the finest china, with toast buttered
to perfection, from year's end to year's end; into which
no money troubles would ever find their way, nor yet
any naughty novels. But such an Eden is not tempting to
me, nor, as I think, to you. I can fancy you stretching
your poor neck over the dyke, longing to fly away that
you might cease to be at rest, but knowing that the
matrimonial dragon was too strong for any such flight. If
ever bird banged his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wings to pieces against gilded bars,
you would have banged yours to pieces in that cage.

<p/>You say that you have failed to make him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) understand that
the matter is settled. I need not say that of course it is
settled, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) must be made to understand it. You
owe it to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) now to put him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) out of all doubt. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is, I
suppose, accessible to the words of a mortal, god though
he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) be. But I do not fear about this, for, after all, you
have as much firmness about you as most people;--perhaps
as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) has at bottom, though you may not have so
many occasions to show it.

<p/>As to that other matter I can only say that you shall be
obliged, as far as it is in my power to obey you. For
what may come out from me by word of mouth when we are
together, I will not answer with certainty. But my pen is
under better control, and it shall not write the offending
name.

<p/>And now I must tell you a little about myself;--or rather,
I am inclined to spin a yarn, and tell you a great deal.
I have got such a lover! But I did describe him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) before.
Of course it's Mr. Cheesacre. If I were to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) hasn't
declared himself, I should hardly give you a fair idea of
my success. And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) has not declared himself,--and,
which is worse, is very anxious to marry a rival. But it's
a strong point in my favour that my rival wants him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) to
take me, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) will assuredly be driven to make me
an offer sooner or later, in obedience to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) orders. My
aunt is my rival, and I do not feel the least doubt as to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) having offered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) half a dozen times. But then she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
has another lover, Captain Bellfield, and I see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>)
prefers him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) is a penniless scamp and looks as though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) drank. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) paints his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) whiskers too, which I don't
like; and, being forty, tries to look like twenty-five.
Otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) is agreeable enough, and I rather approve of
my aunt's taste in preferring him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).

<p/>But my lover has solid attractions, and allures me on by
a description of the fat cattle which he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) sends to market.
He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) is a man of substance, and should I ever become Mrs.
Cheesacre, I have reason to think that I shall not be left
in want. We went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) place on a visit the other day.
Oileymead is the name of my future home;--not so pretty
as Nethercoats, is it? And we had such a time there! We
reached the place at ten and left it at four, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
managed to give us three meals. I'm sure we had before our
eyes at different times every bit of china, delf, glass,
and plate in the establishment. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) made us go into the
cellar, and told us how much wine he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had got there, and
how much beer. <div class="bookquote">``It's all paid for, Mrs. Greenow, every
bottle of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) said, turning round to my aunt, with a
pathetic earnestness, for which I had hardly given him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
credit. <div class="bookquote">``Everything in this house is my own; it's all paid
for. I don't call anything a man's own till it's paid for.
Now that jacket that Bellfield swells about with on the
sands at Yarmouth,--that's not his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own,--and it's not
like to be either.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) winked his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) eye as though
bidding my aunt to think of that before she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) encouraged
such a lover as Bellfield. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) took us into every bedroom,
and disclosed to us all the glories of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) upper chambers.
It would have done you good to see him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) lifting the
counterpanes, and bidding my aunt feel the texture of
the blankets! And then to see her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) turn round to me and
say:--<div class="bookquote">``Kate, it's simply the best-furnished house I ever
went over in my life!'' (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``It does seem very comfortable,''
 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Comfortable!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I don't think
there's anybody can say that Oileymead isn't comfortable.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I did so think of you and Nethercoats. The attractions
are the same;--only in the one place you would have a god
for your keeper, and in the other a brute. For myself, if
ever I'm to have a keeper at all, I shall prefer a man.
But when we got to the farmyard his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eloquence reached the
highest pitch. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Greenow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``look at that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pointed to heaps of manure raised like the streets of a
little city. <div class="bookquote">``Look at that!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There's a great deal,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said
my aunt. <div class="bookquote">``I believe you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I've more muck upon
this place here than any farmer in Norfolk, gentle or
simple; I don't care who the other is.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Only fancy, Alice;
it may all be mine; the blankets, the wine, the muck, and
the rest of it. So my aunt assured me when we got home
that evening. When I remarked that the wealth had been
exhibited to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) and not to me, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) did not affect to deny
it, but treated that as a matter of no moment. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) wants
a wife, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and you may pick him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) up
to-morrow by putting out your hand.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>When I remarked that
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind seemed to be intent on low things, and specially
named the muck, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) only laughed at me. <div class="bookquote">``Money's never
dirty,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``nor yet what makes money.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) talks of
taking lodgings in Norwich for the winter, saying that in
her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) widowed state she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) will be as well there as anywhere
else, and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) wants me to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) up to Christmas.
Indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) first proposed the Norwich plan on the ground
that it might be useful to me,--with a view to Mr.
Cheesacre, of course; but I fancy that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is unwilling
to tear herself away from Captain Bellfield. At any rate
to Norwich she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) will go, and I have promised not to leave
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) before the second week in November. With all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>)
absurdities I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) faults are terrible faults,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) has not the fault of hiding them by falsehood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>)
is never stupid, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) is very good-natured. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) would
have allowed me to equip myself from head to foot at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>)
expense, if I would have accepted her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) liberality, and
absolutely offered to give me my trousseau if I would
marry Mr. Cheesacre.

<p/>I live in the hope that you will come down to the old
place at Christmas. I won't offend you more than I can
help. At any rate he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) won't be there. And if I don't see
you there, where am I to see you? If I were you I would
certainly not go to Cheltenham. You are never happy there.

<p/>Do you ever dream of the river at Basle? I do;--so often.

<p/>Most affectionately yours,

<p/>KATE VAVASOR.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Greenow, look at that.'' (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/>Alice had almost lost the sensation created by the former portion of
Kate's letter by the fun of the latter, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had quite made
that sensation her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) own. The picture of the Cambridgeshire Eden would
have displeased her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) dwelt upon it, and the allusion to the
cream and toast would have had the very opposite effect to that which
Kate had intended. Perhaps Kate had felt this, and had therefore
merged it all in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) stories about Mr. Cheesacre. <div class="bookquote">``I will go to
Cheltenham,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said to herself. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) has recommended it. I shall
never be his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) wife;--but, till we have parted altogether, I will show
him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) that I think well of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) advice.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>That same afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) father that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would go to Lady Macleod's at Cheltenham before
the end of the month. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was, in truth, prompted to this by a
resolution, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was herself hardly conscious, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would
not at this period of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) life be in any way guided by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cousin.
Having made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mind about Mr. Grey, it was right that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) should
let her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cousin know her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) purpose; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would never be driven to
confess to herself that Kate had influenced her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) in the matter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
would go to Cheltenham. Lady Macleod would no doubt vex her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) by hourly
solicitations that the match might be renewed; but, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) knew
herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had strength to withstand Lady Macleod.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) received one letter from Mr. Grey before the time came
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) departure, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) answered it, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>)
intention;--telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) also that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) now felt herself bound to
explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) father her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) present position. <div class="bookquote">``I tell you this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``in consequence of what you said to me on the matter. My father
will know it to-morrow, and on the following morning I shall start
for Cheltenham. I have heard from Lady Macleod and she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) expects me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>On the following morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) did tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) father, standing by him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sat at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) breakfast. <div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), putting down his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tea-cup
and looking up into her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) face; <div class="bookquote">``What! not marry John Grey!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, papa; I know how strange you must think it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you say that there has been no quarrel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--there has been no quarrel. By degrees I have learned to feel
that I should not make him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) happy as his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's d--d nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vavasor. Now such an expression as
this from him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>), addressed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) daughter, showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was very
deeply moved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa! don't talk to me in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is. I never heard such trash in my life. If he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) comes to me I
shall tell him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) so. Not make him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) happy! Why can't you make him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) happy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are not suited to each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what's the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'s a gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'s a gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And a man of honour, and with good means, and with all that
knowledge and reading which you profess to like. Look here, Alice;
I am not going to interfere, nor shall I attempt to make you marry
anyone. You are your own mistress as far as that is concerned. But I
do hope, for your sake and for mine,--I do hope that there is nothing
again between you and your cousin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is nothing, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not like your going abroad with him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), though I didn't choose
to interrupt your plan by saying so. But if there were anything of
that kind going on, I should be bound to tell you that your cousin's
position at present is not a good one. Men do not speak well of him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is nothing between us, papa; but if there were, men speaking
ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) would not deter me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And men speaking well of Mr. Grey will not do the other thing. I know
very well that women can be obstinate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't come to this resolution without thinking much about it,
papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose not. Well;--I can't say anything more. You are your own
mistress, and your fortune is in your own keeping. I can't make you
marry John Grey. I think you very foolish, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) comes to me I
shall tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) so. You are going down to Cheltenham, are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, papa; I have promised Lady Macleod.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. I'd sooner it should be you than me; that's all I can
say.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) newspaper, thereby showing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had
nothing further to say on the matter, and Alice left him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) alone.

<p/>The whole thing was so vexatious that even Mr. Vavasor was disturbed
by it. As it was not term time he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had no signing to do in Chancery
Lane, and could not, therefore, bury his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) unhappiness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) daily
labour,--or rather in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) labour that was by no means daily. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
sat at home till four o'clock, expressing to himself in various
phrases his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) wonder that <div class="bookquote">``any man alive should ever rear a daughter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) got to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) club the waiters found him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) quite unmanageable
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) dinner, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) ate alone, rejecting all proposition of
companionship. But later in the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) regained his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) composure
over a glass of whiskey-toddy and a cigar. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s got her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own money,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``and what does it matter? I don't suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'ll
marry her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) cousin. I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s fool enough for that. And after
all she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'ll probably make it up again with John Grey.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And in this way
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) might let this annoyance run off him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>), and that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) need not as a father take the trouble of any interference.

<p/>But while he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) club there came a visitor to Queen Anne
Street, and that visitor was the dangerous cousin of whom, according
to his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) uncle's testimony, men at present did not speak well. Alice
had not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) since they had parted on the day of their arrival
in London,--nor, indeed, had heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) whereabouts. In the
consternation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mind at this step which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was taking,--a step
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had taught herself to regard as essentially her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) duty before
it was taken, but which seemed to herself to be false and treacherous
the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had taken it,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had become aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been
wrong to travel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt sure,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was sure,--that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) doing so had in nowise affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) dealings
with Mr. Grey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was very certain,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was
certain,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would have rejected him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) just the same had she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
never gone to Switzerland. But every one would say of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
journey to Switzerland with such companions had produced that result.
It had been unlucky and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was sorry for it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) now wished to
avoid all communication with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin till this affair should be
altogether over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was especially unwilling to see him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had not felt it necessary to give any special injunctions as to his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
admittance; and now, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had time to think of it,--on the eve
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) departure for Cheltenham,--he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was in the room with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), just
as the dusk of the October evening was coming on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was sitting
away from the fire, almost behind the window-curtains, thinking of
John Grey and very unhappy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thoughts, when George Vavasor was
announced. It will of course be understood that Vavasor had at this
time received his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) sister's letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had received it, and had had
time to consider the matter since the Sunday morning on which we
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) own rooms in Cecil Street. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) can turn it all into
capital to-morrow, if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) pleases,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had said to himself when
thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) income. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had also reminded himself that her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
grandfather would probably enable him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) to settle an income out of the
property upon Alice, in the event of their being married. And then
he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) had also felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) could have no greater triumph than <div class="bookquote">``walking
atop of John Grey,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) called it. His (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) return for the Chelsea
Districts would hardly be sweeter to him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) than that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must have thought I had vanished out of the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George,
coming up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) extended hand.

<p/>Alice was confused, and hardly knew how to address him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Somebody
told me that you were shooting,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said after a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So I was, but my shooting is not like the shooting of your great
Nimrods,--men who are hunters upon the earth. Two days among the
grouse and two more among the partridges are about the extent of it.
Capel Court is the preserve in which I am usually to be found.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice knew nothing of Capel Court, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Capel Court</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you heard from Kate?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>George asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, once or twice; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) is still at Yarmouth with Aunt Greenow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is going to Norwich, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) says. Kate seems to have made
a league with Aunt Greenow. I, who don't pretend to be very
disinterested in money matters, think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) is quite right. No
doubt Aunt Greenow may marry again, but friends with forty thousand
pounds are always agreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe that Kate thinks much of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) ought, I dare say. Poor Kate is not a rich woman,
or, I fear, likely to become one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) doesn't seem to dream of
getting married, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) own fortune is less than a hundred a year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Girls who never dream of getting married are just those who make the
best marriages at last,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps so, but I wish I was easier about Kate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) is the best
sister a man ever had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I have done nothing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) as yet. I did think, while I was in
that wine business, that I could have done anything I pleased for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). But my grandfather's obstinacy put me out of that; and now I'm
beginning the world again,--that is, comparatively. I wonder whether
you think I'm wrong in trying to get into Parliament?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; quite right. I admire you for it. It is just what I would do in
your place. You are unmarried, and have a right to run the risk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so glad to hear you speak like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had now
managed to take up that friendly, confidential, almost affectionate
tone of talking which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had so often used when abroad with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and
which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had failed to assume when first entering the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have always thought so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have never said it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't I? I thought I had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not heartily like that. I know that people abuse me;--my own people,
my grandfather, and probably your father,--saying that I am reckless
and the rest of it. I do risk everything for my object; but I do not
know that any one can blame me,--unless it be Kate. To whom else do I
owe anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Kate does not blame you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) sympathizes with me; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) only, unless it be you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) paused for an answer, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) none. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) is brave
enough to give me her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) hearty sympathy. But perhaps for that very
reason I ought to be the more chary in endangering the only support
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) is like to have. What is ninety pounds a year for the
maintenance of a single lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope that Kate will always live with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice; <div class="bookquote">``that is, as
soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) has lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) home at Vavasor Hall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had been very crafty and had laid a trap for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had laid a
trap for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had fallen into it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had determined not to
be induced to talk of herself; but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had brought the thing round so
cunningly that the words were out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mouth before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) remembered
whither they would lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did remember this as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was
speaking them, but then it was too late.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What;--at Nethercoats?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Neither she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) nor I doubt your love,
but few men would like such an intruder as that into their household,
and of all men Mr. Grey, whose nature is retiring, would like it the
least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not thinking of Nethercoats,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, no; that is it, you see. Kate says so often to me that when you
are married she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) will be alone in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) will ever find that I shall separate myself from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not by any will of your own. Poor Kate! You cannot be surprised
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) should think of your marriage with dread. How much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
life has been made up of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) companionship with you;--and all the
best of it too! You ought not to be angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) for regarding your
withdrawal into Cambridgeshire with dismay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice could not act the lie which now seemed to be incumbent on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not let him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) talk of Nethercoats as though it were to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
future home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) made the struggle, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not
do it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was unable to find the words which should tell no lie to
the ear, and which should yet deceive him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Kate may still live with
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said slowly. <div class="bookquote">``Everything is over between me and Mr. Grey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice!--is that true?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, George; it is true. If you will allow me to say so, I would
rather not talk about it;--not just at present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And does Kate know it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Kate knows it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And my uncle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, papa knows it also.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice, how can I help speaking of it? How can I not tell you that I
am rejoiced that you are saved from a thraldom which I have long felt
sure would break your heart?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray do not talk of it further.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; if I am forbidden I shall of course obey. But I own it is hard
to me. How can I not congratulate you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>To this she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) answered nothing,
but beat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) foot upon the floor as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) were impatient
of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) words. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Alice, I understand. You are angry with me,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``And yet you have no right to be surprised that when
you tell me this I should think of all that passed between us in
Switzerland. Surely the cousin who was with you then has a right to
say what he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) thinks of this change in your life; at any rate he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) may do
so, if as in this case he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) approves altogether of what you are doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad of your approval, George; but pray let that be an end to
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>After that the two sat silent for a minute or two. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was waiting
for him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to go, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not bid him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) leave the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was
angry with herself, in that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had allowed herself to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) altered plans, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would
not understand that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ought to be spared all conversation on
the subject. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat looking through the window at the row of
gaslights as they were being lit, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) remained in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) chair with
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) elbow on the table and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head resting on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember asking me whether I ever shivered,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said at last;
<div class="bookquote">''--whether I ever thought of things that made me shiver? Don't you
remember; on the bridge at Basle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Alice;--one cause for my shivering is over. I won't say more
than that now. Shall you remain long at Cheltenham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just a month.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then you come back here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so. Papa and I will probably go down to Vavasor Hall
before Christmas. How much before I cannot say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall see you at any rate after your return from Cheltenham? Of
course Kate will know, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) will tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; Kate will know. I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) will stay here when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) comes up
from Norfolk. Good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Alice. I shall have fewer fits of that inward shivering
that you spoke of,--many less, on account of what I have now heard.
God bless you, Alice; good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) went he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand and pressed it closely between his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own.
In those days when they were lovers,--engaged lovers, a close,
long-continued pressure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand had been his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) most eloquent speech
of love. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had not been given to many kisses,--not even to many
words of love. But he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand and hold it, even as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
looked away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) remembered well the touch of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) palm.
It was ever cool,--cool, and with a surface smooth as a woman's,--a
small hand that had a firm grip. There had been days when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
loved to feel that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own was within it, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) trusted in it, and
intended that it should be her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) staff through life. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) distrusted
it; and as the thoughts of the old days came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and the
remembrance of that touch was recalled, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand away
rapidly. Not for that had she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) driven from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as honest a man as had
ever wished to mate with a woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), George Vavasor, had never so
held her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand since the day when they had parted, and now on this
first occasion of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) freedom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt it again. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) think of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could transfer her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) love in that way, as
a flower may be taken from one buttonhole and placed in another? He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
read it all, and knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was hurrying on too quickly. <div class="bookquote">``I can
understand well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) said in a whisper, <div class="bookquote">``what your present feelings
are; but I do not think you will be really angry with me because I
have been unable to repress my joy at what I cannot but regard as
your release from a great misfortune.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) went.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My release!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, seating herself on the chair from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
had risen. <div class="bookquote">``My release from a misfortune! No;--but my fall from
heaven! Oh, what a man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is! That he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have loved me, and that
I should have driven him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) away from me!''  (<font color='red'><b>that master hers</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thoughts travelled off to
the sweetness of that home at Nethercoats, to the excellence of that
master who might have been hers; and then in an agony of despair
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been an idiot and a fool, as well as
a traitor. What had she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wanted in life that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should have thus
quarrelled with as happy a lot as ever had been offered to a woman?
Had she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) not been mad, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sent from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) side the only man that
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loved,--the only man that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had ever truly respected? For hours
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat there, all alone, putting out the candles which the servant
had lighted for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and leaving untasted the tea that was brought to
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>Poor Alice! I hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) may be forgiven. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) special
fault, that when at Rome she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) longed for Tibur, and when at Tibur
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) regretted Rome. Not that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin George is to be taken as
representing the joys of the great capital, though Mr. Grey may be
presumed to form no inconsiderable part of the promised delights
of the country. Now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had sacrificed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) Tibur, because it
had seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that the sunny quiet of its pastures lacked the
excitement necessary for the happiness of life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was again
prepared to quarrel with the heartlessness of Rome, and already was
again sighing for the tranquillity of the country.

<p/>Sitting there, full of these regrets, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) declared to herself that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father's return, and then, throwing herself
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) love and upon his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mercy, would beg him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to go to Mr. Grey and
ask for pardon for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I should be very humble to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said;
<div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is so good, that I may dare to be humble before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) waited till twelve, till one, till
two;--but still he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not come. Later than that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not dare to
wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) feared to trust him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) on such business returning so
late as that,--after so many cigars; after, perhaps, some superfluous
beakers of club nectar. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) temper at such a moment would not be fit
for such work as hers. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was late in coming home, who had
sent him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) away from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) home in unhappiness? Between two and three she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
went to bed, and on the following morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) left Queen Anne Street
for the Great Western Station before her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father was up.




<p/>CHAPTER XV.

<p/>Paramount Crescent.


<p/>Lady Macleod lived at No. 3, Paramount Crescent, in Cheltenham, where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) occupied a very handsome first-floor drawing-room, with a bedroom
behind it, looking over a stable-yard, and a small room which would
have been the dressing-room had the late Sir Archibald been alive,
but which was at present called the dining-room: and in it Lady
Macleod did dine whenever her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) larger room was to be used for any
purposes of evening company. The vicinity of the stable-yard was not
regarded by the tenant as among the attractions of the house; but it
had the effect of lowering the rent, and Lady Macleod was a woman who
regarded such matters. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) income, though small, would have sufficed
to enable her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) to live removed from such discomforts; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) was one
of those women who regard it as a duty to leave something behind
them,--even though it be left to those who do not at all want it;
and Lady Macleod was a woman who wilfully neglected no duty. So
she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) pinched herself, and inhaled the effluvia of the stables, and
squabbled with the cabmen, in order that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) might bequeath a
thousand pounds or two to some Lady Midlothian, who cared, perhaps,
little for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), and would hardly thank her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) memory for the money.

<p/>Had Alice consented to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would have merged that duty
of leaving money behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in that other duty of finding a home for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) adopted niece. But Alice had gone away, and therefore the money
was due to Lady Midlothian rather than to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). The saving, however,
was postponed whenever Alice would consent to visit Cheltenham; and a
bedroom was secured for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) which did not look out over the stables.
Accommodation was also found for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) maid much better than that
provided for Lady Macleod's own maid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) was a hospitable, good old
woman, painfully struggling to do the best she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) could in the world. It
was a pity that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) was such a bore, a pity that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) was so hard to
cabmen and others, a pity that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) suspected all tradesmen, servants,
and people generally of a rank of life inferior to her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) own, a pity
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) was disposed to condemn for ever and ever so many of her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) own
rank because they played cards on week days, and did not go to church
on Sundays,--and a pity, as I think above all, that while she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) was
so suspicious of the poor she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) was so lenient to the vices of earls,
earl's sons, and such like.

<p/>Alice, having fully considered the matter, had thought it most
prudent to tell Lady Macleod by letter what she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had done in regard
to Mr. Grey. There had been many objections to the writing of such a
letter, but there appeared to be stronger objection to that telling
it face to face which would have been forced upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) not
written. There would in such case have arisen on Lady Macleod's
countenance a sternness of rebuke which Alice did not choose
to encounter. The same sternness of rebuke would come upon the
countenance on receipt of the written information; but it would come
in its most aggravated form on the immediate receipt of the letter,
and some of its bitterness would have passed away before Alice's
arrival. I think that Alice was right. It is better for both parties
that any great offence should be confessed by letter.

<p/>But Alice trembled as the cab drew up at No. 3, Paramount Crescent.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) aunt, as was usual, just inside the drawing-room door,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) saw at once that if any bitterness had passed away from that
face, the original bitterness must indeed have been bitter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
so timed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) letter that Lady Macleod should have no opportunity of
answering it. The answer was written there in the mingled anger and
sorrow of those austere features.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) niece in her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) arms and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>);
<div class="bookquote">``oh, Alice, what is this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>niece</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, aunt; it is very bad, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>and poor Alice tried to make a
jest of it. <div class="bookquote">``Young ladies are very wicked when they don't know their
own minds. But if they haven't known them and have been wicked, what
can they do but repent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Repent!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div>said Lady Macleod. <div class="bookquote">``Yes; I hope you will repent. Poor Mr.
Grey;--what must he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) think of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can only hope, aunt, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) won't think of it at all for very
long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's nonsense, my dear, Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)'ll think of it, and of course
you'll marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I, aunt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you will. Why, Alice, hasn't it been all settled among
families? Lady Midlothian knew all the particulars of it just as
well as I did. And is not your word pledged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)? I really don't
understand what you mean. I don't see how it is possible you should
go back. Gentlemen when they do that kind of thing are put out of
society;--but I really think it is worse in a woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then they may if they please put me out of society;--only that I
don't know that I'm particularly in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the wickedness of the thing, Alice! I'm obliged to say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When you talk to me about society, aunt, and about Lady Midlothian,
I give up to you, willingly;--the more willingly, perhaps, because I
don't care much for one or the other.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div>Here Lady Macleod tried to say
a word; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) failed, and Alice went on, boldly looking up into her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
aunt's face, which became a shade more bitter than ever. <div class="bookquote">``But when
you tell me about wickedness and my conscience, then I must be my own
judge. It is my conscience, and the fear of committing wickedness,
that has made me do this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should submit to be guided by your elders, Alice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; my elders in such a matter as this cannot teach me. It cannot be
right that I should go to a man's house and be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, if I do not
think that I can make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why did you accept him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I was mistaken. I am not going to defend that. If you choose
to scold me for that, you may do so, aunt, and I will not answer you.
But as to marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) or not marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now,--as to that, I must
judge for myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a pity you did not know your own mind earlier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a pity,--a great pity. I have done myself an injury that is
quite irretrievable;--I know that, and am prepared to bear it. I have
done him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), too, an injustice which I regret with my whole heart. I
can only excuse myself by saying that I might have done him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a worse
injustice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>All this was said at the very moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) arrival, and the greeting
did not seem to promise much for the happiness of the next month; but
perhaps it was better for them both that the attack and the defence
should thus be made suddenly, at their first meeting. It is better to
pull the string at once when you are in the shower-bath, and not to
stand shivering, thinking of the inevitable shock which you can only
postpone for a few minutes. Lady Macleod in this case had pulled the
string, and thus reaped the advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) alacrity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) ladyship, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you will like to go
up-stairs and take off your bonnet. Mary shall bring you some tea
when you come down.''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>So Alice escaped, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) returned to the
comfort of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cup of tea in the drawing-room, the fury of the storm
had passed away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat talking of other things till dinner; and
though Lady Macleod did during the evening make one allusion to <div class="bookquote">``poor
Mr. Grey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div>the subject was allowed to drop. Alice was very tender as
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) aunt's ailments, was more than ordinarily attentive to the
long list of Cheltenham iniquities which was displayed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and
refrained from combating any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) aunt's religious views. After
a while they got upon the subject of Aunt Greenow, for whose name
Lady Macleod had a special aversion,--as indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had for all the
Vavasor side of Alice's family; and then Alice offered to read, and
did read to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) aunt many pages out of one of those terrible books of
wrath, which from time to time come forth and tell us that there is
no hope for us. Lady Macleod liked to be so told; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) now,
poor woman, could not read at nights herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) enjoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>)
evening.

<p/>Lady Macleod no doubt did enjoy her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) niece's sojourn at Cheltenham,
but I do not think it could have been pleasant to Alice. On the
second day nothing was said about Mr. Grey, and Alice hoped that by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) continual readings in the book of wrath her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) aunt's heart might
be softened towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). But it seemed that Lady Macleod measured
the periods of respite, for on the third day and on the fifth she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>)
returned to the attack. <div class="bookquote">``Did John Grey still wish that the match
should go on?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) asked, categorically. It was in vain that Alice
tried to put aside the question, and begged that the matter might
not be discussed. Lady Macleod insisted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) right to carry on the
examination, and Alice was driven to acknowledge that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
did wish it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could hardly say otherwise, seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had at
that moment a letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) pocket, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) still spoke
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) engagement as being absolutely binding on him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), and expressed a
hope that this change from London to Cheltenham would bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) round
and set everything to rights. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) certainly did, in a fashion, wave
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) hand over her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), as Kate had said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). This letter Alice had
resolved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would not answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would probably write again,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would beg him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) to desist. Instead of Cheltenham bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
round, Cheltenham had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) firmer than ever in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) resolution. I
am inclined to think that the best mode of bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) round at this
moment would have been a course of visits from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin George, and
a series of letters from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin Kate. Lady Macleod's injunctions
would certainly not bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) round.

<p/>After ten days, ten terrible days, devoted to discussions on
matrimony in the morning, and to the book of wrath in the
evening,--relieved by two tea-parties, in which the sins of
Cheltenham were discussed at length,--Lady Macleod herself got a
letter from Mr. Grey. Mr. Grey's kindest compliments to Lady Macleod.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) believed that Lady Macleod was aware of the circumstances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
engagement with Miss Vavasor. Might he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) call on Miss Vavasor at Lady
Macleod's house in Cheltenham? and might he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) also hope to have the
pleasure of making Lady Macleod's acquaintance? Alice had been in
the room when her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) aunt received this letter, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) aunt had said
nothing, and Alice had not known from whom the letter had come.
When her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) aunt crept away with it after breakfast she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had suspected
nothing, and had never imagined that Lady Macleod, in the privacy of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) own room looking out upon the stables, had addressed a letter to
Nethercoats. But such a letter had been addressed to Nethercoats,
and Mr. Grey had been informed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would be received in Paramount
Crescent with great pleasure.

<p/>Mr. Grey had even indicated the day on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would come, and on the
morning of that day Lady Macleod had presided over the two teacups
in a state of nervous excitement which was quite visible to Alice.
More than once Alice asked little questions, not supposing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
was specially concerned in the matter which had caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) aunt's
fidgety restlessness, but observing it so plainly that it was almost
impossible not to allude to it. <div class="bookquote">``There's nothing the matter, my dear,
at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div>at last Lady Macleod said; but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) said so she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) was making
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) mind that the moment had not come in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) must apprise
Alice of Mr. Grey's intended visit. As Alice had questioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) at the
breakfast table she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would say nothing about it then, but waited till
the teacups were withdrawn, and till the maid had given her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) last
officious poke to the fire. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) began. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had Mr. Grey's letter
in her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) pocket, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) prepared herself to speak, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) pulled it
out and held it on the little table before her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I expect a visitor here to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice knew instantly who was the expected visitor. Probably any girl
under such circumstances would have known equally well. <div class="bookquote">``A visitor,
aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, and managed to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knowledge admirably.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Alice a visitor. I should have told you before, only I
thought,--I thought I had better not. It is Mr.--Mr. Grey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, aunt! Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) coming to see you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) is desirous no doubt of seeing you more especially; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
has expressed a wish to make my acquaintance, which I cannot, under
the circumstances, think is unnatural. Of course, Alice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) must want
to talk over this affair with your friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could have spared them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice,--<div class="bookquote">``I wish I could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) letter here, and you can see it if you please.
It is very nicely written, and as far as I am concerned I should not
think of refusing to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). And now comes the question. What are we
to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)? Am I to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) to dinner? I take it for granted that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) will not expect me to offer him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) a bed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) knows that I live in
lodgings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, aunt; he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) certainly will not expect that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But ought I to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) to dinner? I should be most happy to
entertain him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), though you know how very scanty my means of doing so
are;--but I really do not know how it might be,--between you and him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>),
I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We should not fight, aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I suppose not;--but if you cannot be affectionate in your manner
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not answer for my manners, aunt; but you may be sure of
this,--that I should be affectionate in my heart. I shall always
regard him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) as a dearly loved friend; though for many years, no doubt,
I shall be unable to express my friendship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That may be all very well, Alice, but it will not be what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) will
want. I think upon the whole that I had better not ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) to
dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not, aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a period of the day in which any special constraint among
people is more disagreeable than at any other time, and then at
dinner the servants must see it. I think there might be some
awkwardness if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) were to dine here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I really think there would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, anxious to have the subject
dropped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) won't think that I am inhospitable. I should be so happy
to do the best I could for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), for I regard him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), Alice, quite as
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) were to be your husband. And when anybody at all connected
with me has come to Cheltenham I always have asked them to dine, and
then I have Gubbins's man to come and wait at table,--as you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of all men in the world Mr. Grey is the last to think about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That should only make me the more careful. But I think it would
perhaps be more comfortable if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) were to come in the evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much more comfortable, aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) will be here in the afternoon, before dinner, and we
had better wait at home for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)'ll want to see you
alone, and therefore I'll retire to my own rooms,'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--looking over
the stables! Dear old lady. <div class="bookquote">``But if you wish it, I will receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
first--and then Martha,'' (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>--Martha was Alice's maid--<div class="bookquote">``can fetch you
down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martha Alice maid</b></font>)</div><p/>This discussion as to the propriety or impropriety of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
lover a dinner had not been pleasant to Alice, but, nevertheless,
when it was over she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt grateful to Lady Macleod. There was an
attempt in the arrangement to make Mr. Grey's visit as little painful
as possible; and though such a discussion at such a time might as
well have been avoided, the decision to which her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ladyship had at
last come with reference both to the dinner and the management of
the visit was, no doubt, the right one.

<p/>Lady Macleod had been quite correct in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) anticipations. At
three o'clock Mr. Grey was announced, and Lady Macleod, alone,
received him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) drawing-room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had intended to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) a
great deal of good advice, to bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) still keep up his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) heart and as
it were hold up his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) head, to confess to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) how very badly Alice was
behaving, and to express her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) entire concurrence with that theory of
bodily ailment as the cause and origin of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) conduct. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found
that Mr. Grey was a man to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not give much advice. It
was he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) who did the speaking at this conference, and not she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
was overawed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) after the first three minutes. Indeed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) first
glance at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had awed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was so handsome,--and then, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
beauty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had so quiet and almost saddened an air! Strange to say
that after she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), Lady Macleod entertained for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) an
infinitely higher admiration than before, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) was less
surprised than she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had been at Alice's refusal of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). The conference
was very short; and Mr. Grey had not been a quarter of an hour in the
house before Martha attended upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) mistress with her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) summons.

<p/>Alice was ready and came down instantly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found Mr. Grey standing
in the middle of the room waiting to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and the look of
majesty which had cowed Lady Macleod had gone from his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) countenance.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) could not have received her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) with a kinder smile, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) come to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) with a promise that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) would at this meeting name the day for
their marriage. <div class="bookquote">``At any rate it does not make him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) unhappy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) said
to herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not angry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that I should have followed you all
the way here, to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, certainly; not angry, Mr. Grey. All anger that there may be
between us must be on your side. I feel that thoroughly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then there shall be none on either side. Whatever may be done, I
will not be angry with you. Your father advised me to come down here
to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I was in London the day you left.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so terrible to think that I should have brought upon you all
this trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will bring upon me much worse trouble than that unless--.
But I have not now come down here to tell you that. I believe that
according to rule in such matters I should not have come to you at
all, but I don't know that I care much about such rules.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is I that have broken all rules.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When a lady tells a gentleman that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) does not wish to see more of
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Grey, I have not told you that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you not? I am glad at any rate to hear you deny it. But you
will understand what I mean. When a gentleman gets his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) dismissal
from a lady he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) should accept it,--that is, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) dismissal under such
circumstances as I have received mine. But I cannot lay down my love
in that way; nor, maintaining my love, can I give up the battle.
It seems to me that I have a right at any rate to know something of
your comings and goings as long as,--unless, Alice, you should take
another name than mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My intention is to keep my own.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>This she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) said in the lowest
possible tone,--almost in a whisper,--with her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) eyes fixed upon the
ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you will not deny me that right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot hinder you. Whatever you may do, I myself have sinned so
against you that I can have no right to blame you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There shall be no question between us of injury from one to
the other. In any conversation that we may have, or in any
correspondence--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Grey, do not ask me to write.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen to me. Should there be any on either side, there shall be no
idea of any wrong done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I have done you wrong;--great wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Alice; I will not have it so. When I asked you to accept my
hand,--begging the greatest boon which it could ever come to my lot
to ask from a fellow-mortal,--I knew well how great was your goodness
to me when you told me that it should be mine. Now that you refuse
it, I know also that you are good, thinking that in doing so you are
acting for my welfare,--thinking more of my welfare than of your
own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, yes; it is so, Mr. Grey; indeed it is so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Believing that, how can I talk of wrong? That you are wrong in your
thinking on this subject,--that your mind has become twisted by
false impressions,--that I believe. But I cannot therefore love you
less,--nor, so believing, can I consider myself to be injured. Nor am
I even so little selfish as you are. I think if you were my wife that
I could make you happy; but I feel sure that my happiness depends on
your being my wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) looked up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) face, but it was still serene in all its manly
beauty. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) cousin George, if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) were moved to strong feeling, showed
it at once in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eyes,--in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mouth, in the whole visage of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
countenance. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) glared in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) anger, and was impassioned in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) love.
But Mr. Grey when speaking of the happiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) entire life, when
confessing that it was now at stake with a decision against him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) that
would be ruinous to it, spoke without a quiver in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) voice, and
had no more sign of passion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) face than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) were telling his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
gardener to move a rose tree.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope--and believe that you will find your happiness elsewhere, Mr.
Grey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; we can but differ, Alice. In that we do differ. And now I will
say one word to explain why I have come here. If I were to write to
you against your will, it would seem that I were persecuting you. I
cannot bring myself to do that, even though I had the right. But if I
were to let you go from me, taking what you have said to me and doing
nothing, it would seem that I had accepted your decision as final. I
do not do so. I will not do so. I come simply to tell you that I am
still your suitor. If you will let me, I will see you again early
in January,--as soon as you have returned to town. You will hardly
refuse to see me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I cannot refuse to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it shall be so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and I will not trouble you with
letters, nor will I trouble you longer now with words. Tell your aunt
that I have said what I came to say, and that I give her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) my kindest
thanks.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) hand and pressed it,--not as George Vavasor
had pressed it,--and was gone. When Lady Macleod returned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) found
that the question of the evening's tea arrangements had settled
itself.




<p/>CHAPTER XVI.

<p/>The Roebury Club.


<p/>It has been said that George Vavasor had a little establishment at
Roebury, down in Oxfordshire, and thither he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) betook himself about
the middle of November. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had been long known in this county, and
whether or no men spoke well of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) as a man of business in London,
men spoke well of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) down there, as one who knew how to ride to
hounds. Not that Vavasor was popular among fellow-sportsmen. It was
quite otherwise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was not a man that made himself really popular
in any social meetings of men. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) did not himself care for the loose
little talkings, half flat and half sharp, of men when they meet
together in idleness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was not open enough in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) nature for such
popularity. Some men were afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>), and some suspected him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>).
There were others who made up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>), seeking his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) intimacy, but these
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) usually snubbed, and always kept at a distance. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had
indulged in all the ordinary pleasures of young men, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had never
been a jovial man. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) conversations with men he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) always seemed to
think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) should use his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) time towards serving some purpose of
business. With women he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was quite the reverse. With women he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) could be
happy. With women he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) could really associate. A woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) could really
love;--but I doubt whether for all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) could treat a woman well.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was known in the Oxfordshire country as a man who knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
was about, and such men are always welcome. It is the man who does
not know how to ride that is made uncomfortable in the hunting field
by cold looks or expressed censure. And yet it is very rarely that
such men do any real harm. Such a one may now and then get among
the hounds or override the hunt, but it is not often so. Many such
complaints are made; but in truth the too forward man, who presses
the dogs, is generally one who can ride, but is too eager or too
selfish to keep in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) proper place. The bad rider, like the bad
whist player, pays highly for what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not enjoy, and should be
thanked. But at both games he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gets cruelly snubbed. At both games
George Vavasor was great and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) never got snubbed.

<p/>There were men who lived together at Roebury in a kind of club,--four
or five of them, who came thither from London, running backwards and
forwards as hunting arrangements enabled them to do so,--a brewer or
two and a banker, with a would-be fast attorney, a sporting literary
gentleman, and a young unmarried Member of Parliament who had no
particular home of his (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) own in the country. These men formed the
Roebury Club, and a jolly life they had of it. They had their own
wine closet at the King's Head,--or Roebury Inn as the house had come
to be popularly called,--and supplied their own game. The landlord
found everything else; and as they were not very particular about
their bills, they were allowed to do pretty much as they liked in
the house. They were rather imperious, very late in their hours,
sometimes, though not often, noisy, and once there had been a hasty
quarrel which had made the landlord in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) anger say that the club
should be turned out of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) house. But they paid well, chaffed the
servants much oftener than they bullied them, and on the whole were
very popular.

<p/>To this club Vavasor did not belong, alleging that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) could not
afford to live at their pace, and alleging, also, that his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) stays at
Roebury were not long enough to make him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) a desirable member. The
invitation to him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was not repeated and he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) lodged elsewhere in the
little town. But he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) occasionally went in of an evening, and would
make up with the members a table at whist.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had come down to Roebury by mail train, ready for hunting the next
morning, and walked into the club-room just at midnight. There he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
found Maxwell the banker, Grindley the would-be fast attorney, and
Calder Jones the Member of Parliament, playing dummy. Neither of the
brewers were there, nor was the sporting literary gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's Vavasor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>said Maxwell, <div class="bookquote">``and now we won't play this
blackguard game any longer. Somebody told me, Vavasor, that you were
gone away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gone away;--what, like a fox?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what it was; that something had happened to you since
last season; that you were married, or dead, or gone abroad. By
George, I've lost the trick after all! I hate dummy like the devil.
I never hold a card in dummy's hand. Yes, I know; that's seven points
on each side. Vavasor, come and cut. Upon my word if any one had
asked me, I should have said you were dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you see, nobody ever does think of asking you anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What you probably mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grindley/Mr. Grindley</b></font>)</div>said Grindley, <div class="bookquote">``is that Vavasor was not
returned for Chelsea last February; but you've seen him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) since that.
Are you going to try it again, Vavasor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grindley/Mr. Grindley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you'll lend me the money I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see what on earth a man gains by going into the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Calder Jones/Jones</b></font>)</div>said
Calder Jones. <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't help myself as it happened, but, upon my
word it's a deuce of a bore. A fellow thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can do as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likes
about going,--but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can't. It wouldn't do for me to give it up,
because--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, of course not; where should we all be?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's you and me, Grindems,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>said Maxwell. <div class="bookquote">``D-- parliament, and now
let's have a rubber.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>They played till three and Mr. Calder Jones lost a good deal of
money,--a good deal of money in a little way, for they never played
above ten-shilling points, and no bet was made for more than a pound
or two. But Vavasor was the winner, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>winner</b></font>) left the room he (<font color='blue'><b>winner</b></font>)
became the subject of some ill-natured remarks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likes coming in here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grindley/Mr. Grindley</b></font>)</div>said Grindley, who had himself
been the man to invite him (<font color='blue'><b>Grindley</b></font>) to belong to the club, and who had at one
time indulged the ambition of an intimacy with George Vavasor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't understand it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Calder Jones/Jones</b></font>)</div>said Calder Jones, who was a little bitter
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) money. <div class="bookquote">``Last year he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to walk in just when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked,
as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were one of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a bad sort of fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grindley/Mr. Grindley</b></font>)</div>said Grindley; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s so uncommonly dark.
I don't know where on earth he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gets his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money from, He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was heir to
some small property in the north, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lost every shilling of that
when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in the wine trade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grindley/Mr. Grindley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're wrong there, Grindems,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>said Maxwell,--making use of a
playful nickname which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grindley</b></font>) had invented for his (<font color='blue'><b>Grindley</b></font>) friend. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made a pot
of money at the wine business, and had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stuck to it he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have
been a rich man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s lost it all since then, and that place in the north into the
bargain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wrong again, Grindems, my boy. If old Vavasor were to die to-morrow,
Vavasor Hall would go just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) might choose to leave it. George may
be a ruined man for aught I know--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grindley/Mr. Grindley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no doubt about that, I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grindley/Mr. Grindley</b></font>)</div>said Grindley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not, Grindems; but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) can't have lost Vavasor Hall because
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has never as yet had an interest in it. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'s the natural heir, and
will probably get it some day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>Calder Jones/Jones</b></font>)</div>said Calder Jones, <div class="bookquote">``isn't it rather odd he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) should
come in here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Calder Jones/Jones</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We've asked him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) often enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>said Maxwell; <div class="bookquote">``not because we like
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), but because we want him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) so often to make up a rubber. I don't
like George Vavasor, and I don't know who does; but I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
better than dummy. And I'd sooner play whist with men I don't like,
Grindems, than I'd not play at all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>A bystander might have thought
from the tone of Mr. Maxwell's voice that he (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) was alluding to Mr.
Grindley himself, but Mr. Grindley didn't seem to take it in that
light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Grindley</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We can't pick men just as we
please. But I certainly didn't think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)'d make it out for
another season.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The club breakfasted the next morning at nine o'clock, in order that
they might start at half-past for the meet at Edgehill. Edgehill is
twelve miles from Roebury, and the hacks would do it in an hour and
a half,--or perhaps a little less. <div class="bookquote">``Does anybody know anything about
that brown horse of Vavasor's?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>said Maxwell. <div class="bookquote">``I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) coming into
the yard yesterday with that old groom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had a brown horse last season,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grindley/Mr. Grindley</b></font>)</div>said Grindley;--<div class="bookquote">``a little thing
that went very fast, but wasn't quite sound on the road.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grindley/Mr. Grindley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was a mare,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>said Maxwell, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) sold her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) to Cinquebars.'' (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>*


<p/>-LSB-*Ah, my friend, from whom I have borrowed this scion of the
nobility! Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) been left with us he (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) would have forgiven me
my little theft, and now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) has gone I will not change
the name.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``For a hundred and fifty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Calder Jones/Jones</b></font>)</div>said Calder Jones, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) wasn't worth
the odd fifty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Calder Jones/Jones</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) won seventy with her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) at Leamington,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>said Maxwell, <div class="bookquote">``and I doubt
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)'d take his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) money now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Cinquebars coming down here this year?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>said Maxwell. <div class="bookquote">``I hope not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)'s the best fellow in
the world, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) can't ride, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) don't care for hunting, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
makes more row than any fellow I ever met. I wish some fellow could
tell me something about that fellow's brown horse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd never buy a horse of Vavasor's if I were you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grindley/Mr. Grindley</b></font>)</div>said Grindley.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) never has anything that's all right all round.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And who has?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>said Maxwell, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) took into his (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) plate a second
mutton chop, which had just been brought up hot into the room
especially for him (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``That's the mistake men make about horses, and
that's why there's so much cheating. I never ask for a warranty with
a horse, and don't very often have a horse examined. Yet I do as
well as others. You can't have perfect horses any more than you can
perfect men, or perfect women. You put up with red hair, or bad
teeth, or big feet,--or sometimes with the devil of a voice. But a
man when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants a horse won't put up with anything! Therefore those
who've got horses to sell must lie. When I go into the market with
three hundred pounds I expect a perfect animal. As I never do that
now I never expect a perfect animal. I like 'em to see; I like 'em to
have four legs; and I like 'em to have a little wind. I don't much
mind anything else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By Jove you're about right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Calder Jones/Jones</b></font>)</div>said Calder Jones. The reader will
therefore readily see that Mr. Maxwell the banker reigned as king in
that club.

<p/>Vavasor had sent two horses on in charge of Bat Smithers, and
followed on a pony about fourteen hands high, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Smithers</b></font>) had ridden as
a cover hack for the last four years. He (<font color='blue'><b>Smithers</b></font>) did not start till near ten,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Smithers</b></font>) was able to catch Bat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Smithers</b></font>) two horses about a mile and a
half on that side of Edgehill. <div class="bookquote">``Have you managed to come along pretty
clean?''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>the master asked as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) came up with his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) servant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They be the most beastly roads in all England,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Bat, who always
found fault with any county in which he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) happened to be located. <div class="bookquote">``But
I'll warrant I'm cleaner than most on 'em. What for any county should
make such roads as them I never could tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The roads about there are bad, certainly;--very bad. But I suppose
they would have been better had Providence sent better materials. And
what do you think of the brown horse, Bat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said no more, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said with a drawl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)'s as fine an animal to look at as ever I put my eye on,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said
George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)'s all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)'s got lots of pace too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) has, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And they tell me you can't beat him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) at jumping.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They can mostly do that, sir, if they're well handled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)'s a deal over my weight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) is, Mr. Vavasor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) is a fourteen stoner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or fifteen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) may, sir. There's no knowing what a `orse can carry till
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)'s tried.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>George asked his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) groom no more questions, but felt sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had
better sell his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brown horse if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could. Now I here protest that
there was nothing specially amiss with the brown horse. Towards the
end of the preceding season he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had overreached himself and had been
lame, and had been sold by some owner with more money than brains who
had not cared to wait for a cure. Then there had gone with him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) a bad
character, and a vague suspicion had attached itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>), as there
does to hundreds of horses which are very good animals in their way.
He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had come thus to Tattersall's, and Vavasor had bought him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) cheap,
thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) might make money of him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>), from his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) form and action.
He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had found nothing amiss with him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>),--nor, indeed, had Bat Smithers.
But his (<font color='blue'><b>Smithers</b></font>) character went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Smithers</b></font>), and therefore Bat Smithers thought
it well to be knowing. George Vavasor knew as much of horses as most
men can,--as, perhaps, as any man can who is not a dealer, or a
veterinary surgeon; but he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>), like all men, doubted his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) own knowledge,
though on that subject he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) would never admit that he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) doubted it.
Therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) took Bat's word and felt sure that the horse was wrong.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall have a run from the big wood,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If they make un break, you will, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate I'll ride the brown horse,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George. Then, as soon
as that was settled between them, the Roebury Club overtook them.

<p/>There was now a rush of horses on the road altogether, and they were
within a quarter of a mile of Edgehill church, close to which was the
meet. Bat with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) two hunters fell a little behind, and the others
trotted on together. The other grooms with their animals were on in
advance, and were by this time employed in combing out forelocks, and
rubbing stirrup leathers and horses' legs free from the dirt of the
roads;--but Bat Smithers was like his (<font color='blue'><b>Smithers</b></font>) master, and did not congregate
much with other men, and Vavasor was sure to give orders to his (<font color='blue'><b>Smithers</b></font>)
servant different from the orders given by others.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you well mounted this year?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>Maxwell asked of George Vavasor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed; I never was what I call well mounted yet. I generally
have one horse and three or four cripples. That brown horse behind
there is pretty good, I believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see your man has got the old chestnut mare with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)'s one of the cripples,--not but what she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)'s as sound as a bell,
and as good a hunter as ever I wish to ride; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) makes a little
noise when she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)'s going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So that you can hear her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) three fields off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grindley/Mr. Grindley</b></font>)</div>said Grindley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Five if the fields are small enough and your ears are sharp enough,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor. <div class="bookquote">``All the same I wouldn't change her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) for the best horse
I ever saw under you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had you there, Grindems,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>said Maxwell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) didn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grindley/Mr. Grindley</b></font>)</div>said Grindley. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) didn't have me at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your horses, Grindley, are always up to all the work they have to
do,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George; <div class="bookquote">``and I don't know what any man wants more than
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had you again, Grindems,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>said Maxwell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can ride against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) any day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grindley/Mr. Grindley</b></font>)</div>said Grindley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; or against a brick wall either, if your horse didn't know any
better,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Had you again, Grindems,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>said Maxwell. Whereupon Mr. Grindley
trotted on, round the corner by the church, and into the field in
which the hounds were assembled. The fire had become too hot for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grindley</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grindley</b></font>) thought it best to escape. Had it been Vavasor alone he (<font color='blue'><b>Grindley</b></font>) would
have turned upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Grindley</b></font>) and snarled, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grindley</b></font>) could not afford to exhibit
any ill temper to the king of the club. Mr. Grindley was not popular,
and were Maxwell to turn openly against him (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) sporting life down at
Roebury would decidedly be a failure.

<p/>The lives of such men as Mr. Grindley,--men who are tolerated in the
daily society of others who are accounted their superiors, do not
seem to have many attractions. And yet how many such men does one see
in almost every set? Why Mr. Grindley should have been inferior to Mr.
Maxwell the banker, or to Stone, or to Prettyman who were brewers, or
even to Mr. Pollock the heavy-weight literary gentleman, I can hardly
say. An attorney by his (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) trade is at any rate as good as a brewer, and
there are many attorneys who hold their heads high anywhere. Grindley
was a rich man,--or at any rate rich enough for the life he (<font color='blue'><b>Grindley</b></font>) led.
I don't know much about his (<font color='blue'><b>Grindley</b></font>) birth, but I believe it was as good as
Maxwell's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) was not ignorant, or a fool;--whereas I rather think
Maxwell was a fool. Grindley had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Grindley</b></font>) own way in the world, but
Maxwell would certainly not have made himself a banker if his (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) father
had not been a banker before him (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>); nor could the bank have gone on
and prospered had there not been partners there who were better men
of business than our friend. Grindley knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grindley</b></font>) had a better
intellect than Maxwell; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Grindley</b></font>) allowed Maxwell to snub him (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>), and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) toadied Maxwell in return. It was not on the score of riding that
Maxwell claimed and held his (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) superiority, for Grindley did not want
pluck, and every one knew that Maxwell had lived freely and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>)
nerves were not what they had been. I think it had come from the
outward look of the men, from the form of each, from the gait and
visage which in one was good and in the other insignificant. The
nature of such dominion of man over man is very singular, but this is
certain that when once obtained in manhood it may be easily held.

<p/>Among boys at school the same thing is even more conspicuous, because
boys have less of conscience than men, are more addicted to tyranny,
and when weak are less prone to feel the misery and disgrace of
succumbing. Who has been through a large school and does not remember
the Maxwells and Grindleys,--the tyrants and the slaves,--those who
domineered and those who submitted? Nor was it, even then, personal
strength, nor always superior courage, that gave the power of
command. Nor was it intellect, or thoughtfulness, nor by any means
such qualities as make men and boys lovable. It is said by many
who have had to deal with boys, that certain among them claim and
obtain ascendancy by the spirit within them; but I doubt whether the
ascendancy is not rather thrust on them than claimed by them. Here
again I think the outward gait of the boy goes far towards obtaining
for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) the submission of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fellows.

<p/>But the tyrant boy does not become the tyrant man, or the slave boy
the slave man, because the outward visage, that has been noble or
mean in the one, changes and becomes so often mean or noble in the
other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By George, there's Pollock!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>said Maxwell, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) rode into the
field by the church. <div class="bookquote">``I'll bet half a crown that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>)'s come down from
London this morning, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>) was up all night last night, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>)
tells us so three times before the hounds go out of the paddock.''  (<font color='red'><b>Pollock/Mr. Pollock</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Pollock was the heavy-weight sporting literary gentleman.




<p/>CHAPTER XVII.

<p/>Edgehill.


<p/>Of all sights in the world there is, I think, none more beautiful
than that of a pack of fox-hounds seated, on a winter morning, round
the huntsman, if the place of meeting has been chosen with anything
of artistic skill. It should be in a grassy field, and the field
should be small. It should not be absolutely away from all buildings,
and the hedgerows should not have been clipped and pared, and made
straight with reference to modern agricultural economy. There should
be trees near, and the ground should be a little uneven, so as to
mark some certain small space as the exact spot where the dogs and
servants of the hunt should congregate.

<p/>There are well-known grand meets in England, in the parks of
noblemen, before their houses, or even on what are called their
lawns; but these magnificent affairs have but little of the beauty
of which I speak. Such assemblies are too grand and too ornate, and,
moreover, much too far removed from true sporting proprieties. At
them, equipages are shining, and ladies' dresses are gorgeous, and
crowds of tradesmen from the neighbouring town have come there to
look at the grand folk. To my eye there is nothing beautiful in
that. The meet I speak of is arranged with a view to sport, but the
accident of the locality may make it the prettiest thing in the
world.

<p/>Such, in a special degree, was the case at Edgehill. At Edgehill the
whole village consisted of three or four cottages; but there was a
small old church, with an old grey tower, and a narrow, green, almost
dark, churchyard, surrounded by elm-trees. The road from Roebury to
the meet passed by the church stile, and turning just beyond it came
upon the gate which led into the little field in which the hounds
felt themselves as much at home as in their kennels. There might be
six or seven acres in the field, which was long and narrow, so that
the huntsman had space to walk leisurely up and down with the pack
clustering round him (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>) considered that longer sitting might
chill them. The church tower was close at hand, visible through
the trees, and the field itself was green and soft, though never
splashing with mud or heavy with holes.

<p/>Edgehill was a favourite meet in that country, partly because foxes
were very abundant in the great wood adjacent, partly because the
whole country around is grass-land, and partly, no doubt, from the
sporting propensities of the neighbouring population. As regards my
own taste, I do not know that I do like beginning a day with a great
wood,--and if not beginning it, certainly not ending it. It is hard
to come upon the cream of hunting, as it is upon the cream of any
other delight. Who can always drink Lafitte of the finest, can always
talk to a woman who is both beautiful and witty, or can always find
the right spirit in the poetry he (<font color='blue'><b>cream</b></font>) reads? A man has usually to work
through much mud before he (<font color='blue'><b>cream</b></font>) gets his (<font color='blue'><b>cream</b></font>) nugget. It is so certainly in
hunting, and a big wood too frequently afflicts the sportsman, as the
mud does the miner. The small gorse cover is the happy, much-envied
bit of ground in which the gold is sure to show itself readily. But
without the woods the gorse would not hold the foxes, and without the
mud the gold would not have found its resting-place.

<p/>But, as I have said, Edgehill was a popular meet, and, as regarded
the meet itself, was eminently picturesque. On the present occasion
the little field was full of horsemen, moving about slowly, chatting
together, smoking cigars, getting off from their hacks and mounting
their hunters, giving orders to their servants, and preparing for the
day. There were old country gentlemen there, greeting each other from
far sides of the county; sporting farmers who love to find themselves
alongside their landlords, and to feel that the pleasures of the
country are common to both; men down from town, like our friends
of the Roebury club, who made hunting their chosen pleasure, and
who formed, in number, perhaps the largest portion of the field;
officers from garrisons round about; a cloud of servants, and a
few nondescript stragglers who had picked up horses, hither and
thither, round the country. Outside the gate on the road were drawn
up a variety of vehicles, open carriages, dog-carts, gigs, and
waggonettes, in some few of which were seated ladies who had come
over to see the meet. But Edgehill was, essentially, not a ladies'
meet. The distances to it were long, and the rides in Cranby
Wood--the big wood--were not adapted for wheels. There were one or
two ladies on horseback, as is always the case; but Edgehill was not
a place popular, even with hunting ladies. One carriage, that of the
old master of the hounds, had entered the sacred precincts of the
field, and from this the old baronet was just descending, as Maxwell,
Calder Jones, and Vavasor rode into the field.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: Edgehill.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I see you well, Sir William,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>said Maxwell, greeting the
master. Calder Jones also made his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) little speech, and so did Vavasor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Humph--well, yes, I'm pretty well, thank`ee. Just move on, will you?
My mare can't stir here.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Then some one else spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)
only grunted in answer. Having slowly been assisted up on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)
horse,--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) was over seventy years of age,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) trotted off to the
hounds, while all the farmers round him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) touched their hats to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>).
But his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) mind was laden with affairs of import, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) noticed no one.
In a whispered voice he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) instructions to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) huntsman, who
said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Sir William,''  (<font color='red'><b>huntsman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Sir William,''  (<font color='red'><b>huntsman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No doubt, Sir William.''
 (<font color='red'><b>huntsman</b></font>)</div>One long-eared, long-legged fellow, in a hunting-cap and scarlet
coat, hung listening by, anxious to catch something of the orders for
the morning. <div class="bookquote">``Who the devil's that fellow, that's all breeches and
boots?''  (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div>said Sir William aloud to some one near him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), as the huntsman
moved off with the hounds. Sir William knew the man well enough, but
was minded to punish him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) discourtesy. <div class="bookquote">``Where shall we find
first, Sir William?''  (<font color='red'><b>Calder Jones/Jones</b></font>)</div>said Calder Jones, in a voice that was really
very humble. <div class="bookquote">``How the mischief am I to know where the foxes are?''
 (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div>said Sir William, with an oath; and Calder Jones retired unhappy, and
for the moment altogether silenced.

<p/>And yet Sir William was the most popular man in the county, and no
more courteous gentleman ever sat at the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) own table. A
mild man he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was, too, when out of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) saddle, and one by no means
disposed to assume special supremacy. But a master of hounds, if he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
have long held the country,--and Sir William had held his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) for more
than thirty years,--obtains a power which that of no other potentate
can equal. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) may say and do what he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) pleases, and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) tyranny is
always respected. No conspiracy against him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) has a chance of success;
no sedition will meet with sympathy;--that is, if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) be successful
in showing sport. If a man be sworn at, abused, and put down without
cause, let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bear it and think that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been a victim for the
public good. And let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never be angry with the master. That rough
tongue is the necessity of the master's position. They used to say
that no captain could manage a ship without swearing at his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) men.
But what are the captain's troubles in comparison with those of the
master of hounds? The captain's men are under discipline, and can
be locked up, flogged, or have their grog stopped. The master of
hounds cannot stop the grog of any offender, and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) can only stop the
tongue, or horse, of such an one by very sharp words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Pollock, when did you come?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>said Maxwell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By George,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the literary gentleman, <div class="bookquote">``just down from London by
the 8.30 from Euston Square, and got over here from Winslow in a
trap, with two fellows I never saw in my life before. We came tandem
in a fly, and did the nineteen miles in an hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Athenian, draw it mild,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>said Maxwell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We did, indeed. I wonder whether they'll pay me their share of the
fly. I had to leave Onslow Crescent at a quarter before eight, and I
did three hours' work before I started.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you did it by candle-light,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grindley/Mr. Grindley</b></font>)</div>said Grindley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I did; and why shouldn't I? Do you suppose no one can work
by candle-light except a lawyer? I suppose you fellows were playing
whist, and drinking hard. I'm uncommon glad I wasn't with you, for I
shall be able to ride.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I bet you a pound,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jones/Jones</b></font>)</div>said Jones, <div class="bookquote">``if there's a run, I see more of it
than you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jones/Jones</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll take that bet with Jones,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grindley/Mr. Grindley</b></font>)</div>said Grindley, <div class="bookquote">``and Vavasor shall be
the judge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grindley/Mr. Grindley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen, the hounds can't get out, if you will stop up the gate,''
 (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div>said Sir William. Then the pack passed through, and they all trotted
on for four miles, to Cranby Wood.

<p/>Vavasor, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) rode on to the wood, was alone, or speaking, from time
to time, a few words to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) servant. <div class="bookquote">``I'll ride the chestnut mare in
the wood,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and do you keep near me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I bean't to be galloping up and down them rides, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
Bat, almost contemptuously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shan't gallop up and down the rides, myself; but do you mark me,
to know where I am, so that I can change if a fox should go away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll be here all day, sir. That's my belief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If so, I won't ride the brown horse at all. But do you take care to
let me have him (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) if there's a chance. Do you understand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, I understand, sir. There ain't no difficulty in my
understanding;--only I don't think, sir, you'll ever get a fox out
of that wood to-day. Why, it stands to reason. The wind's from the
north-east.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cranby Wood</b></font>)</div><p/>Cranby Wood is very large,--there being, in truth, two or three woods
together. It was nearly twelve before they found; and then for an
hour there was great excitement among the men, who rode up and down
the rides as the hounds drove the fox from one end to another of the
enclosure. Once or twice the poor animal did try to go away, and then
there was great hallooing, galloping, and jumping over unnecessary
fences; but he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) was headed back again, or changed his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) mind, not liking
the north-east wind of which Bat Smithers had predicted such bad
things. After one the crowd of men became rather more indifferent,
and clustered together in broad spots, eating their lunch, smoking
cigars, and chaffing each other. It was singular to observe the
amazing quantity of ham sandwiches and of sherry that had been
carried into Cranby Wood on that day. Grooms appeared to have been
laden with cases, and men were as well armed with flasks at their
saddle-bows as they used to be with pistols. Maxwell and Pollock
formed the centre of one of these crowds, and chaffed each other with
the utmost industry, till, tired of having inflicted no wounds, they
turned upon Grindley and drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Grindley</b></font>) out of the circle. <div class="bookquote">``You'll make
that man cut his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) throat, if you go on at that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pollock/Mr. Pollock</b></font>)</div>said Pollock. <div class="bookquote">``Shall
I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>said Maxwell. <div class="bookquote">``Then I'll certainly stick to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for the sake of
humanity in general.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>During all this time Vavasor sat apart, quite
alone, and Bat Smithers grimly kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Smithers</b></font>) place, about three hundred
yards from him (<font color='blue'><b>Smithers</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shan't do any good to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grindley/Mr. Grindley</b></font>)</div>said Grindley, coming up to Vavasor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That old fellow has got to be so stupid, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) doesn't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s
about,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grindley/Mr. Grindley</b></font>)</div>said Grindley, meaning Sir William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) make the fox break?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor; and as his (<font color='blue'><b>Grindley</b></font>) voice was
by no means encouraging Grindley rode away.

<p/>Lunch and cigars lasted till two, during which hour the hounds, the
huntsmen, the whips, and old Sir William were hard at work, as also
were some few others who persistently followed every chance of the
game. From that till three there were two or three flashes in the
pan, and false reports as to foxes which had gone away, which first
set men galloping, and then made them very angry. After three, men
began to say naughty things, to abuse Cranby Wood, to wish violently
that they had remained at home or gone elsewhere, and to speak
irreverently of their ancient master. <div class="bookquote">``It's the cussidest place in
all creation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>said Maxwell. <div class="bookquote">``I often said I'd not come here any
more, and now I say it again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet you'll be here the next meet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grindley/Mr. Grindley</b></font>)</div>said Grindley, who had
sneaked back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grindley</b></font>) old companions in weariness of spirit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Grindems, you know a sight too much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>said Maxwell; <div class="bookquote">``you do indeed.
An ordinary fellow has no chance with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div><p/>Grindley was again going to catch it, but was on this time saved by
the appearance of the huntsman, who came galloping up one of the
rides, with a lot of the hounds at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grindley</b></font>) heels.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) isn't away, Tom, surely?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>said Maxwell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s out of the wood somewheres,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom</b></font>)</div>said Tom;--and off they all went.
Vavasor changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) horse, getting on to the brown one, and giving
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) chestnut mare to Bat Smithers, who suggested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) might
as well go home to Roebury now. Vavasor gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) no answer, but,
trotting on to the point where the rides met, stopped a moment and
listened carefully. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) took a path diverging away from that by
which the huntsmen and the crowd of horsemen had gone, and made the
best of his (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) way through the wood. At the end of this he (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) came upon Sir
William, who, with no one near him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) but his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) servant, was standing in
the pathway of a little hunting-gate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div>said Sir William. <div class="bookquote">``The hounds are not out of the wood
yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is the fox away, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the good of that if we can't get the hounds out?--Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>)'s
away. He (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) passed out where I'm standing.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) began to blow
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) horn lustily, and by degrees other men and a few hounds came down
the ride. Then Tom, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) horse almost blown, made his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) appearance
outside the wood, and soon there came a rush of men, nearly on the
top of one another, pushing on, not knowing whither, but keenly alive
to the fact that the fox had at last consented to move his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) quarters.

<p/>Tom touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hat, and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) master, inquiringly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>)'s
gone for Claydon's,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master. <div class="bookquote">``Try them up that hedgerow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom</b></font>)</div>Tom did try them up the hedgerow, and in half a minute the hounds
came upon the scent. Then you might see men settling their hats on
their heads, and feeling their feet in the stirrups. The moment for
which they had so long waited had come, and yet there were many
who would now have preferred that the fox should be headed back
into cover. Some had but little confidence in their half-blown
horses;--with many the waiting, though so abused and anathematized,
was in truth more to their taste than the run itself;--with others
the excitement had gone by, and a gallop over a field or two was
necessary before it would be restored. With most men at such a moment
there is a little nervousness, some fear of making a bad start, a
dread lest others should have more of the success of the hunt than
falls to them. But there was a great rush and a mighty bustle as the
hounds made out their game, and Sir William felt himself called upon
to use the rough side of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) tongue to more than one delinquent.

<p/>And then certain sly old stagers might be seen turning off to the
left, instead of following the course of the game as indicated by the
hounds. They were men who had felt the air as they came out, and knew
that the fox must soon run down wind, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) might do for the
first half mile or so,--men who knew also which was the shortest way
to Claydon's by the road. Ah, the satisfaction that there is when
these men are thrown out, and their dead knowledge proved to be of no
avail! If a fox will only run straight, heading from the cover on his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>)
real line, these very sagacious gentlemen seldom come to much honour
and glory.

<p/>In the present instance the beast seemed determined to go straight
enough, for the hounds ran the scent along three or four hedgerows
in a line. He (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) had managed to get for himself full ten minutes' start,
and had been able to leave the cover and all his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) enemies well behind
him (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) bethought himself as to his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) best way to his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) purposed
destination. And here, from field to field, there were little
hunting-gates at which men crowded lustily, poking and shoving each
other's horses, and hating each other with a bitterness of hatred
which is, I think, known nowhere else. No hunting man ever wants
to jump if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can help it, and the hedges near the gate were not
alluring. A few there were who made lines for themselves, taking the
next field to the right, or scrambling through the corners of the
fences while the rush was going on at the gates; and among these was
George Vavasor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) never rode in a crowd, always keeping himself
somewhat away from men as well as hounds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would often be thrown
out, and then men would hear no more of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) for that day. On such
occasions he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) did not show himself, as other men do, twenty minutes
after the fox had been killed or run to ground,--but betook himself
home by himself, going through the byeways and lanes, thus leaving no
report of his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) failure to be spoken of by his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) compeers.

<p/>As long as the line of gates lasted, the crowd continued as thick as
ever, and the best man was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whose horse could shove the hardest.
After passing some four or five fields in this way they came out
upon a road, and, the scent holding strong, the dogs crossed it
without any demurring. Then came doubt into the minds of men, many
of whom, before they would venture away from their position on the
lane, narrowly watched the leading hounds to see whether there was
indication of a turn to the one side or the other. Sir William, whose
seventy odd years excused him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), turned sharp to the left, knowing that
he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) could make Claydon's that way; and very many were the submissive
horsemen who followed him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>); a few took the road to the right, having
in their minds some little game of their own. The hardest riders
there had already crossed from the road into the country, and were
going well to the hounds, ignorant, some of them, of the brook
before them, and others unheeding. Foremost among these was Burgo
Fitzgerald,--Burgo Fitzgerald, whom no man had ever known to crane at
a fence, or to hug a road, or to spare his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own neck or his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horse's.
And yet poor Burgo seldom finished well,--coming to repeated grief in
this matter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) hunting, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) did so constantly in other matters
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) life.

<p/>But almost neck and neck with Burgo was Pollock, the sporting
literary gentleman. Pollock had but two horses to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>) stud, and was
never known to give much money for them;--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>) weighed without his (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>)
boots, fifteen stones! No one ever knew how Pollock did it;--more
especially as all the world declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>) was as ignorant of
hunting as any tailor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>) could ride, or when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>) couldn't ride he (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>)
could tumble,--men said that of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>),--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>) would ride as long as
the beast under him (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>) could go. But few knew the sad misfortunes which
poor Pollock sometimes encountered;--the muddy ditches in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>)
was left; the despair with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>) would stand by his (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>) unfortunate
horse when the poor brute could no longer move across some
deep-ploughed field; the miles that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>) would walk at night beside a
tired animal, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>) way slowly back to Roebury!

<p/>Then came Tom the huntsman, with Calder Jones close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>), and
Grindley intent on winning his (<font color='blue'><b>Grindley</b></font>) sovereign. Vavasor had also crossed
the road somewhat to the left, carrying with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grindley</b></font>) one or two who knew
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grindley</b></font>) was a safe man to follow. Maxwell had been ignominiously
turned by the hedge, which, together with its ditch, formed a fence
such as all men do not love at the beginning of a run. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) had turned
from it, acknowledging the cause. <div class="bookquote">``By George!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that's too
big for me yet awhile; and there's no end of a river at the bottom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) had followed the master down the road.

<p/>All those whom we have named managed to get over the brook, Pollock's
horse barely contriving to get up his (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>) hind legs from the broken edge
of the bank. Some nags refused it, and their riders thus lost all
their chance of sport for that day. Such is the lot of men who hunt.
A man pays five or six pounds for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) day's amusement, and it is ten
to one that the occurrences of the day disgust rather than gratify
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! One or two got in, and scrambled out on the other side, but
Tufto Pearlings, the Manchester man from Friday Street, stuck in the
mud at the bottom, and could not get his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mare out till seven men
had come with ropes to help him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Where the devil is my fellow?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the countrymen</b></font>)</div>Pearlings asked of the countrymen; but the countrymen could not tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) fellow''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) second horse was riding the hunt with
great satisfaction to himself.

<p/>George Vavasor found that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) horse went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) uncommonly well,
taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) fences almost in the stride of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) gallop, and giving
unmistakeable signs of good condition. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder what it is that's
amiss with him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George to himself, resolving, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
would sell him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) that day if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) got an opportunity. Straight went the
line of the fox, up from the brook, and Tom began to say that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
master had been wrong about Claydon's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are we now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo, as four or five of them dashed
through the open gate of a farmyard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is Bulby's farm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``and we're going right away for
Elmham Wood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Elmham Wood be d--,''  (<font color='red'><b>a stout farmer</b></font>)</div>said a stout farmer, who had come as far as
that with them. <div class="bookquote">``You won't see Elmham Wood to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you know best,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom</b></font>)</div>said Tom; and then they were through the
yard, across another road, and down a steep ravine by the side of a
little copse. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>)'s been through them firs, any way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">``To
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>), Gaylass!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then up they went the other side of the ravine, and
saw the body of the hounds almost a field before them at the top.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say,--that took some of the wind out of a fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pollock/Mr. Pollock</b></font>)</div>said Pollock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mustn't mind about wind now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo, dashing on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wasn't the pace awful, coming up to that farmhouse?''  (<font color='red'><b>Calder Jones/Jones</b></font>)</div>said Calder
Jones, looking round to see if Grindley was shaken off. But Grindley,
with some six or seven others, was still there. And there, also,
always in the next field to the left, was George Vavasor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had
spoken no word to any one since the hunt commenced, nor had he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) wished
to speak to any one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) desired to sell his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) horse,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) desired
also to succeed in the run for other reasons than that, though I
think he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would have found it difficult to define them.

<p/>Now they had open grass land for about a mile, but with very heavy
fences,--so that the hounds gained upon them a little, and Pollock's
weight began to tell. The huntsman and Burgo were leading with some
fortunate county gentleman whose good stars had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) in upon
them at the farmyard gate. It is the injustice of such accidents as
this that breaks the heart of a man who has honestly gone through all
the heat and work of the struggle! And the hounds had veered a little
round to the left, making, after all, for Claydon's. <div class="bookquote">``Darned if the
Squire warn't right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom</b></font>)</div>said Tom. Sir William, though a baronet, was
familiarly called the Squire throughout the hunt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We ain't going for Claydon's now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>asked Burgo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Them's Claydon's beeches we sees over there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">''`Tain't
often the Squire's wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom</b></font>)</div><p/>Here they came to a little double rail and a little quick-set hedge.
A double rail is a nasty fence always if it has been made any way
strong, and one which a man with a wife and a family is justified in
avoiding. They mostly can be avoided, having gates; and this could
have been avoided. But Burgo never avoided anything, and went over
it beautifully. The difficulty is to be discreet when the man before
one has been indiscreet. Tom went for the gate, as did Pollock, who
knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could have no chance at the double rails. But Calder
Jones came to infinite grief, striking the top bar of the second rail,
and going head-foremost out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) saddle, as though thrown by a
catapult. There we must leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>). Grindley, rejoicing greatly at
this discomfiture, made for the gate; but the country gentleman with
the fresh horse accomplished the rails, and was soon alongside of
Burgo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't see you at the start,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I didn't see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the country gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the country gentleman; <div class="bookquote">``so it's even.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the country gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>Burgo did not see the thing in the same light, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) said no more.
Grindley and Tom were soon after them, Tom doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) utmost to shake
off the attorney. Pollock was coming on also; but the pace had been
too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>), and though the ground rode light his (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>) poor beast
laboured and grunted sorely. The hounds were still veering somewhat
to the left, and Burgo, jumping over a small fence into the same
field with them, saw that there was a horseman ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>). This was
George Vavasor, who was going well, without any symptom of distress.

<p/>And now they were at Claydon's, having run over some seven miles of
ground in about thirty-five minutes. To those who do not know what
hunting is, this pace does not seem very extraordinary; but it had
been quite quick enough, as was testified by the horses which had
gone the distance. Our party entered Claydon's Park at back, through
a gate in the park palings that was open on hunting days; but a much
more numerous lot was there almost as soon as them, who had come in
by the main entrance. This lot was headed by Sir William, and our
friend Maxwell was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A jolly thing so far,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo to Maxwell; <div class="bookquote">``about the best we've
had this year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't see a yard of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>said Maxwell. <div class="bookquote">``I hadn't nerve to get off
the first road, and I haven't been off it ever since.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>Maxwell was a
man who never lied about his (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) hunting, or had the slightest shame in
riding roads. <div class="bookquote">``Who's been with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There've been Tom and I;--and Calder Jones was there for a while.
I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) killed himself somewhere. And there was Pollock, and your
friend Grindley, and a chap whose name I don't know who dropped out
of heaven about half-way in the run; and there was another man whose
back I saw just now; there he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is,--by heavens, it's Vavasor! I didn't
know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Claydon</b></font>)</div><p/>They hung about the Claydon covers for ten minutes, and then their
fox went off again,--their fox or another, as to which there was a
great discussion afterwards; but he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) who would have suggested the
idea of a new fox to Sir William would have been a bold man. A fox,
however, went off, turning still to the left from Claydon's towards
Roebury. Those ten minutes had brought up some fifty men; but it did
not bring up Calder Jones nor Tufto Pearlings, nor some half-dozen
others who had already come to serious misfortune; but Grindley was
there, very triumphant in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grindley</b></font>) own success, and already talking of
Jones's sovereign. And Pollock was there also, thankful for the ten
minutes' law, and trusting that wind might be given to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>) horse to
finish the run triumphantly.

<p/>But the pace on leaving Claydon's was better than ever. This may have
come from the fact that the scent was keener, as they got out so
close upon their game. But I think they must have changed their fox.
Maxwell, who saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) go, swore that he (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) was fresh and clean. Burgo
said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) knew it to be the same fox, but gave no reason. <div class="bookquote">``Same
fox! in course it was; why shouldn't it be the same?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom</b></font>)</div>said Tom. The
country gentleman who had dropped from heaven was quite sure that
they had changed, and so were most of those who had ridden the road.
Pollock confined himself to hoping that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>) might soon be killed, and
that thus his (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>) triumph for the day might be assured.

<p/>On they went, and the pace soon became too good for the poor author.
His (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) horse at last refused a little hedge, and there was not another
trot to be got out of him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>). That night Pollock turned up at Roebury
about nine o'clock, very hungry,--and it was known that his (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>) animal
was alive;--but the poor horse ate not a grain of oats that night,
nor on the next morning. Vavasor had again taken a line to himself,
on this occasion a little to the right of the meet; but Maxwell
followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) and rode close with him (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) to the end. Burgo for a while
still led the body of the field, incurring at first much condemnation
from Sir William,--nominally for hurrying on among the hounds, but in
truth because he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) got before Sir William himself. During this latter
part of the run Sir William stuck to the hounds in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
seventy odd years. Going down into Marham Bottom, some four or five
were left behind, for they feared the soft ground near the river, and
did not know the pass through it. But Sir William knew it, and those
who remained close to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) got over that trouble. Burgo, who would
still lead, nearly foundered in the bog;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was light, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
horse pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) through,--leaving a fore-shoe in the mud. After that
Burgo was contented to give Sir William the lead.

<p/>Then they came up by Marham Pits to Cleshey Small Wood, which they
passed without hanging there a minute, and over the grass lands of
Cleshey Farm. Here Vavasor and Maxwell joined the others, having
gained some three hundred yards in distance by their course, but
having been forced to jump the Marham Stream which Sir William had
forded. The pace now was as good as the horses could make it,--and
perhaps something better as regarded some of them. Sir William's
servant had been with him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had got his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) second horse at
Claydon's; Maxwell had been equally fortunate; Tom's second horse
had not come up, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) beast was in great distress; Grindley had
remained behind at Marham Bottom, being contented perhaps with having
beaten Calder Jones,--from whom by-the-by I may here declare that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)
never got his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) sovereign. Burgo, Vavasor, and the country gentleman
still held on; but it was devoutly desired by all of them that the
fox might soon come to the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) tether. Ah! that intense
longing that the fox may fail, when the failings of the horse begin
to make themselves known,--and the consciousness comes on that all
that one has done will go for nothing unless the thing can be brought
to a close in a field or two! So far you have triumphed, leaving
scores of men behind; but of what good is all that, if you also are
to be left behind at the last?

<p/>It was manifest now to all who knew the country that the fox was
making for Thornden Deer Park, but Thornden Deer Park was still two
miles ahead of them, and the hounds were so near to their game that
the poor beast could hardly hope to live till he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) got there. He (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) had
tried a well-known drain near Cleshey Farm House; but it had been
inhospitably, nay cruelly, closed against him (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>). Soon after that he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>)
threw himself down in a ditch, and the eager hounds overran him (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>),
giving him (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) a moment's law,--and giving also a moment's law to horses
that wanted it as badly. <div class="bookquote">``I'm about done for,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo to Maxwell.
<div class="bookquote">``Luckily for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>said Maxwell, <div class="bookquote">``the fox is much in the same way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div><p/>But the fox had still more power left in him (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) than poor Burgo
Fitzgerald's horse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) gained a minute's check and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) started
again, being viewed away by Sir William himself. The country
gentleman of whom mention has been made also viewed him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and holloa'd
as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did so: <div class="bookquote">``Yoicks, tally; gone away!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The unfortunate man! <div class="bookquote">``What
the d-- are you roaring at?''  (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div>said Sir William. <div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose
I don't know where the fox is?''  (<font color='red'><b>the country gentleman</b></font>)</div>Whereupon the country gentleman
retreated, and became less conspicuous than he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had been.

<p/>Away they went again, off Cleshey and into Thornden parish, on the
land of Sorrel Farm,--a spot well to be remembered by one or two ever
afterwards. Here Sir William made for a gate which took him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) a little
out of the line, but Maxwell and Burgo Fitzgerald, followed by
Vavasor, went straight ahead. There was a huge ditch and boundary
bank there which Sir William had known and had avoided. Maxwell,
whose pluck had returned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) at last, took it well. His (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) horse was
comparatively fresh and made nothing of it. Then came poor Burgo!
Oh, Burgo, hadst thou not have been a very child, thou shouldst have
known that now, at this time of the day,--after all that thy gallant
horse had done for thee,--it was impossible to thee or him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>). But when
did Burgo Fitzgerald know anything? He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) rode at the bank as though it
had been the first fence of the day, striking his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) poor beast with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>)
spurs, as though muscle, strength, and new power could be imparted by
their rowels. The animal rose at the bank and in some way got upon
it, scrambling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) struck it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) chest, and then fell headlong
into the ditch at the other side, a confused mass of head, limbs, and
body. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) career was at an end, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had broken his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) heart! Poor
noble beast, noble in vain! To his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) very last gasp he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had done his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>)
best, and had deserved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) should have been in better hands. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>)
master's ignorance had killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>). There are men who never know how
little a horse can do,--or how much!

<p/>There was to some extent a gap in the fence when Maxwell had first
ridden it and Burgo had followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>); a gap, or break in the hedge at
the top, indicating plainly the place at which a horse could best get
over. To this spot Vavasor followed, and was on the bank at Burgo's
heels before he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) knew what had happened. But the man had got away and
only the horse lay there in the ditch. <div class="bookquote">``Are you hurt?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor;
<div class="bookquote">``can I do anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not stop, <div class="bookquote">``If you can find a chap
just send him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Burgo in a melancholy tone. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) sat
down, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) feet in the ditch, and looked at the carcase of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
horse.

<p/>There was no more need of jumping that day. The way was open into the
next field,--a turnip field,--and there amidst the crisp breaking
turnip-tops, with the breath of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) enemies hot upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), with their
sharp teeth at his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) entrails, biting at them impotently in the agonies
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) death struggle, poor Reynard finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) career. Maxwell was
certainly the first there,--but Sir William and George Vavasor were
close upon him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). That taking of brushes of which we used to hear is
a little out of fashion; but if such honour were due to any one it
was due to Vavasor, for he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) only had ridden the hunt throughout.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) claimed no honour, and none was specially given to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
and Maxwell rode homewards together, having sent assistance to poor
Burgo Fitzgerald; and as they went along the road, saying but little
to each other, Maxwell, in a very indifferent voice, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) a
question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want for that horse, Vavasor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A hundred and fifty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maxwell/Mr. Maxwell</b></font>)</div>said Maxwell. So the brown horse was sold for about half
his (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) value, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) had brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Maxwell</b></font>) a bad character.




<p/>CHAPTER XVIII.

<p/>Alice Vavasor's Great Relations.


<p/>Burgo Fitzgerald, of whose hunting experiences something has been
told in the last chapter, was a young man born in the purple of the
English aristocracy. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was related to half the dukes in the kingdom,
and had three countesses for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) aunts. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came of age he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
master of a sufficient fortune to make it quite out of the question
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be asked to earn his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bread; and though that, and other
windfalls that had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), had long since been spent, no one
had ever made to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so ridiculous a proposition as that. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was now
thirty, and for some years past had been known to be much worse than
penniless; but still he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lived on in the same circles, still slept
softly and drank of the best, and went about with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) valet and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
groom and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horses, and fared sumptuously every day. Some people
said the countesses did it for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and some said that it was the
dukes;--while others, again, declared that the Jews were his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) most
generous friends. At any rate he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still seemed to live as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
always lived, setting tradesmen at defiance, and laughing to scorn
all the rules which regulate the lives of other men.

<p/>About eighteen months before the time of which I am now speaking,
a great chance had come in this young man's way, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had almost
succeeded in making himself one of the richest men in England. There
had been then a great heiress in the land, on whom the properties of
half-a-dozen ancient families had concentrated; and Burgo, who in
spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) iniquities still kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) position in the drawing-rooms
of the great, had almost succeeded in obtaining the hand and the
wealth,--as people still said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had obtained the heart,--of the
Lady Glencora M``Cluskie. But sundry mighty magnates, driven almost
to despair at the prospect of such a sacrifice, had sagaciously
put their heads together, and the result had been that the Lady
Glencora had heard reason. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had listened,--with many haughty
tossings indeed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) proud little head, with many throbbings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
passionate young heart; but in the end she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) listened and heard reason.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) saw Burgo, for the last time, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was the
promised bride of Plantagenet Palliser, nephew and heir of the Duke
of Omnium.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) had borne it like a man,--never having groaned openly, or quivered
once before any comrade at the name of the Lady Glencora. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had
married Mr. Palliser at St. George's Square, and on the morning of the
marriage he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had hung about his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) club door in Pall Mall, listening to
the bells, and saying a word or two about the wedding, with admirable
courage. It had been for him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) a great chance,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had lost it.
Who can say, too, that his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) only regret was for the money? He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had
spoken once of it to a married sister of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), in whose house he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had
first met Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``I shall never marry now,--that is all,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) said--and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) went about, living his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) old reckless life, with
the same recklessness as ever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was one of those young men with
dark hair and blue eyes,--who wear no beard, and are certainly among
the handsomest of all God's creatures. No more handsome man than
Burgo Fitzgerald lived in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) days; and this merit at any rate was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>),--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) thought nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) own beauty. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) lived ever
without conscience, without purpose,--with no idea that it behoved
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) as a man to do anything but eat and drink,--or ride well to
hounds till some poor brute, much nobler than himself, perished
beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chiefly concerns our story at this present time because the Lady
Glencora who had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--and would have married him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not those
sagacious heads prevented it,--was a cousin of Alice Vavasor's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
was among those very great relations with whom Alice was connected by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mother's side,--being indeed so near to Lady Macleod, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>)
was first cousin to that lady, only once removed. Lady Midlothian
was aunt to the Lady Glencora, and our Alice might have called
cousins, and not been forbidden, with the old Lord of the Isles, Lady
Glencora's father,--who was dead, however, some time previous to that
affair with Burgo,--and with the Marquis of Auld Reekie, who was
Lady Glencora's uncle, and had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) guardian. But Alice had kept
herself aloof from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) grand relations on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mother's side, choosing
rather to hold herself as belonging to those who were her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father's
kindred. With Lady Glencora, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had for a short time--for
some week or ten days,--been on terms of almost affectionate
intimacy. It had been then, when the wayward heiress with the bright
waving locks had been most strongly minded to give herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>)
wealth to Burgo Fitzgerald. Burgo had had money dealings with George
Vavasor, and knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>),--knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) intimately, and had learned the
fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) cousinship between the heiress and his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) friend's cousin.
Whereupon in the agony of those weeks in which the sagacious heads
were resisting her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) love, Lady Glencora came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) cousin in Queen
Anne Street, and told Alice all that tale. <div class="bookquote">``Was Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) asked,
<div class="bookquote">``afraid of the marquises and the countesses, or of all the rank and
all the money which they boasted?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Alice answered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was not at
all afraid of them. <div class="bookquote">``Then would she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) permit Lady Glencora and Burgo
to see each other in the drawing-room at Queen Anne Street, just
once!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Just once,--so that they might arrange that little plan of an
elopement. But Alice could not do that for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) newly found cousin.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) endeavoured to explain that it was not the dignity of the
sagacious heads which stood in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) way, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) woman's feeling of
what was right and wrong in such a matter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I not marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) eyes
flashing. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) is my equal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice explained that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had no word to say against such a marriage.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) counselled her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin to be true to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) love if her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) love was in
itself true. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), an unmarried woman, who had hitherto not known
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cousin, might not give such help as that! <div class="bookquote">``If you will not help
me, I am helpless!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said the Lady Glencora, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) kneeled at
Alice's knees and threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wavy locks abroad on Alice's lap. <div class="bookquote">``How
shall I bribe you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``Next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) I will love you
better than all the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>But Alice, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) kissed the fair
forehead and owned that such reward would be worth much to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), could
not take any bribe for such a cause. Then Lady Glencora had been
angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) heartless, and threatening her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
too might have sorrow of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) own and want assistance. Alice told
nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own tale,--how she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin and had been
forced to give him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) up, but said what kind words she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
of the waving hair and light blue eyes had been pacified. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had come again,--had come daily while the sagacious heads were at
work,--and Alice in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) trouble had been a comfort to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).

<p/>But the sagacious heads were victorious, as we know, and Lady
Glencora M``Cluskie became Lady Glencora Palliser with all the
propriety in the world, instead of becoming wife to poor Burgo, with
all imaginable impropriety. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wrote a letter to Alice,
very short and rather sad; but still with a certain sweetness in it.
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been counselled that it was not fitting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to love as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had thought to love, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had resolved to give up her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) dream.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin Alice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew, would respect her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) secret. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was going
to become the wife of the best man, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought, in all the world;
and it should be the one care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) life to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) happy.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
said not a word in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) letter of loving this newly found lord.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was to be married at once. Would Alice be one among the bevy of
bridesmaids who were to grace the ceremony?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) joy heartily,--<div class="bookquote">``heartily,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, but had
declined that office of bridesmaid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not wish to undergo the
cold looks of the Lady Julias and Lady Janes who all would know each
other, but none of whom would know her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). So she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) cousin a
little ring, and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) to keep it amidst all the wealthy tribute
of marriage gifts which would be poured forth at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) feet.

<p/>From that time to this present Alice had heard no more of Lady
Glencora. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had been married late in the preceding season and
had gone away with Mr. Palliser, spending her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) honeymoon amidst the
softnesses of some Italian lake. They had not returned to England
till the time had come for them to encounter the magnificent
Christmas festivities of Mr. Palliser's uncle, the Duke. On this
occasion Gatherum Castle, the vast palace which the Duke had built at
a cost of nearly a quarter of a million, was opened, as it had never
been opened before;--for the Duke's heir had married to the Duke's
liking, and the Duke was a man who could do such things handsomely
when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was well pleased. Then there had been a throng of bridal
guests, and a succession of bridal gaieties which had continued
themselves even past the time at which Mr. Palliser was due at
Westminster;--and Mr. Palliser was a legislator who served his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
country with the utmost assiduity. So the London season commenced,
progressed, and was consumed; and still Alice heard nothing more of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) friend and cousin Lady Glencora.

<p/>But this had troubled her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) not at all. A chance circumstance, the
story of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had told to no one, had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) a short intimacy
with this fair child of the gold mines, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had felt that they
two could not live together in habits of much intimacy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had, when
thinking of the young bride, only thought of that wild love episode
in the girl's life. It had been strange to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should in
one week have listened to the most passionate protestations from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
friend of love for one man, and then have been told in the next that
another man was to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) friend's husband! But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) reflected that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own career was much the same,--only with the interval of some
longer time.

<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own career was not the same. Glencora had married Mr.
Palliser,--had married him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) without pausing to doubt;--but Alice had
gone on doubting till at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had resolved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would not
marry Mr. Grey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought of this much in those days at Cheltenham,
and wondered often whether Glencora lived with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband in the
full happiness of conjugal love.

<p/>One morning, about three days after Mr. Grey's visit, there came to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) two letters, as to neither of which did she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) know the writer by
the handwriting. Lady Macleod had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>),--with some hesitation,
indeed, for Lady Macleod was afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>),--but had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>),
nevertheless, more than once, that those noble relatives had heard of
the treatment to which Mr. Grey was being subjected, and had expressed
their great sorrow,--if not dismay or almost anger. Lady Macleod,
indeed, had gone as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) dared, and might have gone further
without any sacrifice of truth. Lady Midlothian had said that it
would be disgraceful to the family, and Lady Glencora's aunt, the
Marchioness of Auld Reekie, had demanded to be told what it was the
girl wanted.

<p/>When the letters came Lady Macleod was not present, and I am disposed
to think that one of them had been written by concerted arrangement
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>). But if so she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had not dared to watch the immediate effect
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) own projectile. This one was from Lady Midlothian. Of the
other Lady Macleod certainly knew nothing, though it also had sprung
out of the discussions which had taken place as to Alice's sins in
the Auld Reekie-Midlothian set. This other letter was from Lady
Glencora. Alice opened the two, one without reading the other, very
slowly. Lady Midlothian's was the first opened, and then came a spot
of anger on Alice's cheeks as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) saw the signature, and caught a
word or two as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eye to glance down the page. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
opened the other, which was shorter, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin's
signature, <div class="bookquote">``Glencora Palliser,''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) read that letter first,--read it
twice before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went back to the disagreeable task of perusing Lady
Midlothian's lecture. The reader shall have both the letters, but
that from the Countess shall have precedence.


<p/>Castle Reekie, N.B.
-- Oct. 186--.

<p/>MY DEAR MISS VAVASOR,

<p/>I have not the pleasure of knowing you personally, though
I have heard of you very often from our dear mutual friend
and relative Lady Macleod, with whom I understand that
you are at present on a visit. Your grandmother,--by
the mother's side,--Lady Flora Macleod, and my mother
the Countess of Leith, were half-sisters; and though
circumstances since that have prevented our seeing so much
of each other as is desirable, I have always remembered
the connection, and have ever regarded you as one in
whose welfare I am bound by ties of blood to take a warm
interest.


<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Since that!'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--what does she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) mean by `since that'?'' said Alice to
herself. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) has never set eyes on me at all. Why does she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) talk of
not having seen as much of me as is desirable?''


 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I had learned with great gratification that you were going
to be married to a most worthy gentleman, Mr. John Grey of
Nethercoats, in Cambridgeshire. When I first heard this
I made it my business to institute some inquiries, and I
was heartily glad to find that your choice had done you
so much credit. -LSB-If the reader has read Alice's character
as I have meant it should be read, it will thoroughly be
understood that this was wormwood to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).-RSB- I was informed
that Mr. Grey is in every respect a gentleman,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) is
a man of most excellent habits, and one to whom any young
woman could commit her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) future happiness with security,
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) means are very good for his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) position, and that
there was no possible objection to such a marriage. All
this gave great satisfaction to me, in which I was joined
by the Marchioness of Auld Reekie, who is connected with
you almost as nearly as I am, and who, I can assure you,
feels a considerable interest in your welfare. I am
staying with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) now, and in all that I say, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) agrees
with me.

<p/>You may feel then how dreadfully we were dismayed when
we were told by dear Lady Macleod that you had told Mr.
Grey that you intended to change your mind! My dear Miss
Vavasor, can this be true? There are things in which a
young lady has no right to change her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mind after it has
been once made up; and certainly when a young lady has
accepted a gentleman, that is one of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) cannot
legally make you become his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wife, but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has a right to
claim you before God and man. Have you considered that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
has probably furnished his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) house in consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
intended marriage,--and perhaps in compliance with your
own especial wishes? -LSB-I think that Lady Macleod must have
told the Countess something that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had heard about the
garden.-RSB- Have you reflected that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has of course told all
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) friends? Have you any reason to give? I am told, none!
Nothing should ever be done without a reason; much less
such a thing as this in which your own interests and,
I may say, respectability are involved. I hope you will
think of this before you persist in destroying your own
happiness and perhaps that of a very worthy man.

<p/>I had heard, some years ago, when you were much younger,
that you had become imprudently attached in another
direction--with a gentleman with none of those qualities
to recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) which speak so highly for Mr. Grey.
It would grieve me very much, as it would also the
Marchioness, who in this matter thinks exactly as I do, if
I were led to suppose that your rejection of Mr. Grey had
been caused by _any renewal of that project_. Nothing, my
dear Miss Vavasor, could be more unfortunate,--and I might
almost add a stronger word.

<p/>I have been advised that a line from me as representing
your poor mother's family, especially as I have at
the present moment the opportunity of expressing Lady
Auld Reekie's sentiments as well as my own, might be
of service. I implore you, my dear Miss Vavasor, to
remember what you owe to God and man, and to carry out an
engagement made by yourself, that is in all respects comme
il faut, and which will give entire satisfaction to your
friends and relatives.

<p/>MARGARET M. MIDLOTHIAN.


<p/>I think that Lady Macleod had been wrong in supposing that this could
do any good. She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) should have known Alice better; and should also
have known the world better. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) own reverence for her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) own noble
relatives was so great that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) could not understand, even yet, that
all such feeling was wanting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) niece. It was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) impossible
that the expressed opinion of such an one as the Countess of
Midlothian, owning her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) relationship and solicitude, and condescending
at the same time to express friendship,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) could not, I say,
understand that the voice of such an one, so speaking, should have no
weight whatever. But I think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had been quite right in keeping
out of Alice's way at the moment of the arrival of the letter. Alice
read it, slowly, and then replacing it in its envelope, leaned back
quietly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) chair,--with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes fixed upon the teapot on the
table. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had, however, the other letter on which to occupy her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
mind, and thus relieve her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) from the effects of too deep an animosity
against the Countess.

<p/>The Lady Glencora's letter was as follows:


<p/>Matching Priory,
Thursday.

<p/>DEAR COUSIN,

<p/>I have just come home from Scotland, where they have been
telling me something of your little troubles. I had little
troubles once too, and you were so good to me! Will you
come to us here for a few weeks? We shall be here till
Christmas-time, when we go somewhere else. I have told my
husband that you are a great friend of mine as well as a
cousin, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) must be good to you. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is very quiet,
and works very hard at politics; but I think you will like
him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). Do come! There will be a good many people here, so
that you will not find it dull. If you will name the day
we will send the carriage for you at Matching Station, and
I dare say I can manage to come myself.

<p/>Yours affectionately,

<p/>G. PALLISER.

<p/>P.S. I know what will be in your mind. You will say, why
did not she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) come to me in London? She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knew the way to
Queen Anne Street well enough. Dear Alice, don't say that.
Believe me, I had much to do and think of in London. And
if I was wrong, yet you will forgive me. Mr. Palliser says
I am to give you his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) love,--as being a cousin,--and say
that you must come!


<p/>This letter was certainly better than the other, but Alice, on
reading it, came to a resolve that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would not accept the
invitation. In the first place, even that allusion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) little
troubles jarred upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) feelings; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
rejection of Mr. Grey could be no special reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should go to
Matching Priory. Was it not very possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been invited
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might meet Lady Midlothian there, and encounter all the
strength of a personal battery from the Countess? Lady Glencora's
letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would of course answer, but to Lady Midlothian she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) would
not condescend to make any reply whatever.

<p/>About eleven o'clock Lady Macleod came down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>). For half-an-hour
or so Alice said nothing; nor did Lady Macleod ask any question. She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>)
looked inquisitively at Alice, eyeing the letter which was lying by
the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) niece's workbasket, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said no word about Mr.
Grey or the Countess. At last Alice spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I have had a letter this morning from your friend,
Lady Midlothian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is my cousin, Alice; and yours as much as mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your cousin then, aunt. But it is of more moment that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is your
friend. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) certainly is not mine, nor can her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) cousinship afford any
justification for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) interfering in my affairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice,--from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) position--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) position can be nothing to me, aunt. I will not submit to it.
There is her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) letter, which you can read if you please. After that you
may burn it. I need hardly say that I shall not answer it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what am I to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), Alice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing from me, aunt;--from yourself, whatever you please, of
course.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then there was silence between them for a few minutes.
<div class="bookquote">``And I have had another letter, from Lady Glencora, who married Mr.
Palliser, and whom I knew in London last spring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And has that offended you, too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, there is no offence in that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) asks me to go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) at
Matching Priory, her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband's house; but I shall not go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>But at last Alice agreed to pay this visit, and it may be as well
to explain here how she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was brought to do so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wrote to Lady
Glencora, declining, and explaining frankly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) did decline,
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) thought it probable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) might there meet Lady
Midlothian. Lady Midlothian, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) said, had interfered very
unwarrantably in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) affairs, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) did not wish to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
acquaintance. To this Lady Glencora replied, post haste, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had
intended no such horrid treachery as that for Alice; that neither
would Lady Midlothian be there, nor any of that set; by which
Alice knew that Lady Glencora referred specially to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) aunt the
Marchioness; that no one would be at Matching who could torment
Alice, either with right or without it, <div class="bookquote">``except so far as I myself
may do so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora said; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) named an early day in
November, at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would herself undertake to meet Alice at the
Matching Station. On receipt of this letter, Alice, after two days'
doubt, accepted the invitation.




<p/>CHAPTER XIX.

<p/>Tribute from Oileymead.


<p/>Kate Vavasor, in writing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) cousin Alice, felt some little
difficulty in excusing herself for remaining in Norfolk with Mrs.
Greenow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had laughed at Mrs. Greenow before she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) went to Yarmouth,
and had laughed at herself for going there. And in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) letters
since, she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) aunt as a silly, vain, worldly woman,
weeping crocodile tears, for an old husband whose death had released
her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) from the tedium of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) company, and spreading lures to catch new
lovers. But yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) agreed to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) aunt, and remain with her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
in lodgings at Norwich for a month.

<p/>But Mrs. Greenow had about her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) something more than Kate had
acknowledged when she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) first attempted to read her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) aunt's character.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was clever, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) own way persuasive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was very generous,
and possessed a certain power of making herself pleasant to those
around her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>). In asking Kate to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had so asked as to
make it appear that Kate was to confer the favour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
niece that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was all alone in the world. <div class="bookquote">``I have money,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had
said, with more appearance of true feeling than Kate had observed
before. <div class="bookquote">``I have money, but I have nothing else in the world. I have
no home. Why should I not remain here in Norfolk, where I know a few
people? If you'll say that you'll go anywhere else with me, I'll go
to any place you'll name.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>Kate had believed this to be hardly true.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had felt sure that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt wished to remain in the neighbourhood
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) seaside admirers; but, nevertheless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had yielded, and at
the end of October the two ladies, with Jeannette, settled themselves
in comfortable lodgings within the precincts of the Close at Norwich.

<p/>Mr. Greenow at this time had been dead very nearly six months, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
widow made some mistakes in her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) dates and appeared to think that the
interval had been longer. On the day of their arrival at Norwich it
was evident that this error had confirmed itself in her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) mind. <div class="bookquote">``Only
think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) unpacked a little miniature of the departed
one, and sat with it for a moment in her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) hands, as she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
handkerchief to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) eyes, <div class="bookquote">``only think, that it is barely nine months
since he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Six, you mean, aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, unadvisedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only nine months''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>repeated Mrs. Greenow, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had not heard
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) niece. <div class="bookquote">``Only nine months!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>After that Kate attempted to correct
no more such errors. <div class="bookquote">``It happened in May, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>Jeannette said
afterwards to Miss Vavasor, <div class="bookquote">``and that, as we reckons, it will be just
a twelvemonth come Christmas.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>But Kate paid no attention to this.

<p/>And Jeannette was very ungrateful, and certainly should have indulged
herself in no such sarcasms. When Mrs. Greenow made a slight change in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) mourning, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) did on her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) arrival at Norwich, using a little
lace among her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) crapes, Jeannette reaped a rich harvest in gifts of
clothes. Mrs. Greenow knew well enough that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) expected more from
a servant than mere service;--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) wanted loyalty, discretion,
and perhaps sometimes a little secrecy;--and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) paid for these
things, she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) should have had them.

<p/>Kate undertook to stay a month with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt at Norwich, and Mrs.
Greenow undertook that Mr. Cheesacre should declare himself as Kate's
lover, before the expiration of the month. It was in vain that Kate
protested that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) wanted no such lover, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would certainly
reject him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) came. <div class="bookquote">``That's all very well, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Greenow</b></font>)</div>Aunt Greenow
would say. <div class="bookquote">``A girl must settle herself some day, you know;--and you'd
have it all your own way at Oileymead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>But the offer certainly showed much generosity on the part of Aunt
Greenow, inasmuch as Mr. Cheesacre's attentions were apparently paid
to herself rather than to her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) niece. Mr. Cheesacre was very attentive.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had taken the lodgings in the Close, and had sent over fowls and
cream from Oileymead, and had called on the morning after their
arrival; but in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) attentions he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) distinguished the aunt more
particularly than the niece. <div class="bookquote">``I am all for Mr. Cheesacre, Miss,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>said Jeannette once. <div class="bookquote">``The Captain is perhaps the nicerer-looking
gentleman, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) ain't so podgy like; but what's good looks if a
gentleman hasn't got nothing? I can't abide anything that's poor;
neither can't Missus.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>From which it was evident that Jeannette gave
Miss Vavasor no credit in having Mr. Cheesacre in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) train.

<p/>Captain Bellfield was also at Norwich, having obtained some
quasi-military employment there in the matter of drilling volunteers.
Certain capacities in that line it may be supposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) possessed,
and, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) friend Cheesacre said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was going to earn an
honest penny once in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) life. The Captain and Mr. Cheesacre had made
up any little differences that had existed between them at Yarmouth,
and were close allies again when they left that place. Some little
compact on matters of business must have been arranged between
them,--for the Captain was in funds again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was in funds again
through the liberality of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) friend,--and no payment of former loans
had been made, nor had there been any speech of such. Mr. Cheesacre
had drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) purse-strings liberally, and had declared that if all
went well the hospitality of Oileymead should not be wanting during
the winter. Captain Bellfield had nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) head and declared that
all should go well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't see much of the Captain, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cheesacre to
Mrs. Greenow on the morning of the day after her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) arrival at Norwich.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had come across the whole way from Oileymead to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
found herself comfortable,--and perhaps with an eye to the Norwich
markets at the same time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) now wore a pair of black riding boots
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) trousers, and a round topped hat, and looked much more at
home than he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had done by the seaside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much, I dare say,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) tells me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) must be
on duty ten or twelve hours a day. Poor fellow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a deuced good thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ought to be very much
obliged to me for putting him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) in the way of getting it. But he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) told
me to tell you that if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) didn't call, you were not to be angry with
him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no;--I shall remember, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) don't work now he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) must come to grief. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hasn't got
a shilling that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) can call his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) really?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a shilling, Mrs. Greenow;--and then he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s awfully in debt. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
isn't a bad fellow, you know, only there's no trusting him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) for
anything.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>Then after a few further inquiries that were almost
tender, and a promise of further supplies from the dairy, Mr.
Cheesacre took his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) leave, almost forgetting to ask after Miss
Vavasor.

<p/>But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) left the house he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had a word to say to Jeannette. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
hasn't been here, has he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), Jenny?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We haven't seen a sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
yet, sir,--and I have thought it a little odd.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>Then Mr. Cheesacre
gave the girl half-a-crown, and went his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) way. Jeannette, I think,
must have forgotten that the Captain had looked in after leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
military duties on the preceding evening.

<p/>The Captain's ten or twelve hours of daily work was performed,
no doubt, at irregular intervals,--some days late and some days
early,--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) might be seen about Norwich almost at all times,
during the early part of that November;--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) might be very
often seen going into the Close. In Norwich there are two weekly
market-days, but on those days the Captain was no doubt kept more
entirely to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) military employment, for at such times he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) never
was seen near the Close. Now Mr. Cheesacre's visits to the town
were generally made on market-days, and so it happened that they
did not meet. On such occasions Mr. Cheesacre always was driven
to Mrs. Greenow's door in a cab,--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) would come into town by
railway,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) would deposit a basket bearing the rich produce of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) dairy. It was in vain that Mrs. Greenow protested against these
gifts,--for she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) did protest and declared that if they were continued,
they would be sent back. They were, however, continued, and Mrs.
Greenow was at her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) wits' end about them. Cheesacre would not come
up with them; but leaving them, would go about his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) business, and
would return to see the ladies. On such occasions he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) would be very
particular in getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) basket from Jeannette. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) did so he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
would generally ask some question about the Captain, and Jeannette
would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) answers confidentially,--so that there was a strong
friendship between these two.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I to do about it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow, as Kate came into the
sitting-room one morning, and saw on the table a small hamper lined
with a clean cloth. <div class="bookquote">``It's as much as Jeannette has been able to
carry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it is, ma'am,--quite; and I'm strong in the arm, too, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I to do, Kate? He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is such a good creature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) do admire you both so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>said Jeannette.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I don't want to offend him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) for many reasons,''  (<font color='red'><b>the aunt</b></font>)</div>said the
aunt, looking knowingly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) niece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know anything about your reasons, aunt, but if I were
you, I should leave the basket just as it is till he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) comes in the
afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you mind seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) yourself, Kate, and explaining to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) that
it won't do to get on in this way. Perhaps you wouldn't mind telling
him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) that if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'ll promise not to bring any more, you won't object to
take this one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, aunt, I can't do that. They're not brought to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Kate!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, aunt;--I won't have you say so;--before Jeannette, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it's for both, ma'am; I do indeed. And there certainly ain't
any cream to be bought like it in Norwich:--nor yet eggs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder what there is in the basket.''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>And the widow lifted up
the corner of the cloth. <div class="bookquote">``I declare if there isn't a turkey poult
already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>said Jeannette. <div class="bookquote">``A turkey poult! Why, that's worth ten and
sixpence in the market if it's worth a penny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's out of the question that I should take upon myself to say
anything to him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word I don't see why you shouldn't, as well as I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Greenow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>said Jeannette: <div class="bookquote">``let me just ask him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) who
they're for;--he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'ll tell me anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't do anything of the kind, Jeannette,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate. <div class="bookquote">``Of course,
aunt, they're brought for you. There's no doubt about that. A
gentleman doesn't bring cream and turkeys to-- I've never heard of
such a thing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see why a gentleman shouldn't bring cream and turkeys to you
just as well as to me. Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) told me once as much himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, if they're for me, I'll leave them down outside the front
door, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) may find his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) provisions there.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>And Kate proceeded to
lift the basket off the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave it alone, Kate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow, with a voice that was
rather solemn; and which had, too, something of sadness in its tone.
<div class="bookquote">``Leave it alone. I'll see Mr. Cheesacre myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I do hope you won't mention my name. It's the most absurd thing
in the world. The man never spoke two dozen words to me in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speaks to me, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And about you, too, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doesn't come here with those big flowers in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) button-hole for
nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>said Jeannette,--<div class="bookquote">``not if I knows what a gentleman means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) doesn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you don't object, aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, <div class="bookquote">``I will write to grandpapa
and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that I will return home at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What!--because of Mr. Cheesacre?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think
you'll be so silly as that, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div><p/>On the present occasion Mrs. Greenow undertook that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) would see
the generous gentleman, and endeavour to stop the supplies from
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) farmyard. It was well understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would call about four
o'clock, when his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) business in the town would be over; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
would bring with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) a little boy, who would carry away the basket.
At that hour Kate of course was absent, and the widow received
Mr. Cheesacre alone. The basket and cloth were there, in the
sitting-room, and on the table were laid out the rich things which
it had contained;--the turkey poult first, on a dish provided in the
lodging-house, then a dozen fresh eggs in a soup plate, then the
cream in a little tin can, which, for the last fortnight, had passed
regularly between Oileymead and the house in the Close, and as to
which Mr. Cheesacre was very pointed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) inquiries with Jeannette.
Then behind the cream there were two or three heads of broccoli, and
a stick of celery as thick as a man's wrist. Altogether the tribute
was a very comfortable assistance to the housekeeping of a lady
living in a small way in lodgings.

<p/>Mr. Cheesacre, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) saw the array on the long sofa-table, knew that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was to prepare himself for some resistance; but that resistance
would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) thought, an opportunity of saying a few words that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was desirous of speaking, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) did not altogether regret it. <div class="bookquote">``I
just called in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``to see how you were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are not likely to starve,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow, pointing to the
delicacies from Oileymead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just a few trifles that my old woman asked me to bring in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said
Cheesacre. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) insisted on putting them up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But your old woman is by far too magnificent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) really frightens Kate and me out of our wits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Cheesacre had no wish that Miss Vavasor's name should be
brought into play upon the occasion. <div class="bookquote">``Dear Mrs. Greenow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``there is no cause for you to be alarmed, I can assure you. Mere
trifles;--light as air, you know. I don't think anything of such
things as these.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I and Kate think a great deal of them,--a very great deal, I can
assure you. Do you know, we had a long debate this morning whether or
no we would return them to Oileymead?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Return them, Mrs. Greenow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed: what are women, situated as we are, to do under such
circumstances? When gentlemen will be too liberal, their liberality
must be repressed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And have I been too liberal, Mrs. Greenow? What is a young turkey and
a stick of celery when a man is willing to give everything that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
has in the world?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got a great deal more in the world, Mr. Cheesacre, than you'd
like to part with. But we won't talk of that, now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When shall we talk of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you really have anything to say, you had by far better speak to
Kate herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Greenow, you mistake me. Indeed, you mistake me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Just at this
moment, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was drawing close to the widow, she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) heard, or fancied
that she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) heard, Jeannette's step, and, going to the sitting-room
door, called to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) maid. Jeannette did not hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>), but the bell
was rung, and then Jeannette came. <div class="bookquote">``You may take these things down,
Jeannette,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Cheesacre has promised that no more shall
come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I haven't promised,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cheesacre.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will oblige me and Kate, I know;--and, Jeannette, tell Miss
Vavasor that I am ready to walk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Mr. Cheesacre knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) could not say those few words on
that occasion; and as the hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) train was near, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
departure, and went out of the Close, followed by the little boy,
carrying the basket, the cloth, and the tin can.




<p/>CHAPTER XX.

<p/>Which Shall It Be?


<p/>The next day was Sunday, and it was well known at the lodging-house
in the Close that Mr. Cheesacre would not be seen there then. Mrs.
Greenow had specially warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was not fond of Sunday
visitors, fearing that otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) might find it convenient to give
them too much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) society on that idle day. In the morning the
aunt and niece both went to the Cathedral, and then at three o'clock
they dined. But on this occasion they did not dine alone. Charlie
Fairstairs, who, with her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) family, had come home from Yarmouth, had
been asked to join them; and in order that Charlie might not feel it
dull, Mrs. Greenow had, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) usual good-nature, invited Captain
Bellfield. A very nice little dinner they had. The captain carved the
turkey, giving due honour to Mr. Cheesacre as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) did so; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
nibbled his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) celery with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) cheese, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was prettily jocose about the
richness of the farmyard at Oileymead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) is the most generous man I ever met,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain Bellfield, <div class="bookquote">``and we'll drink his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) health. Poor
old Cheesy! It's a great pity he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) shouldn't get himself a wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know any man more calculated to make a young woman happy,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Fairstairs. <div class="bookquote">``I'm told that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house and all
about it is quite beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Especially the straw-yard and the horse-pond,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain. And
then they drank the health of their absent friend.

<p/>It had been arranged that the ladies should go to church in the
evening, and it was thought that Captain Bellfield would, perhaps,
accompany them; but when the time for starting came, Kate and Charlie
were ready, but the widow was not, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) remained,--in order, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) afterwards explained to Kate, that Captain Bellfield might not
seem to be turned out of the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had made no offer churchwards,
and,--<div class="bookquote">``Poor man,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>as Mrs. Greenow said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) little explanation,
<div class="bookquote">``if I hadn't let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stay there, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have had no resting-place
for the sole of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) foot, but some horrid barrack-room!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>Therefore
the Captain was allowed to find a resting-place in Mrs. Greenow's
drawing-room; but on the return of the young ladies from church, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
was not there, and the widow was alone, <div class="bookquote">``looking back,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``to
things that were gone;--that were gone. But come, dears, I am not
going to make you melancholy.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So they had tea, and Mr. Cheesacre's
cream was used with liberality.

<p/>Captain Bellfield had not allowed the opportunity to slip idly from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) hands. In the first quarter of an hour after the younger ladies
had gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said little or nothing, but sat with a wine-glass before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), which once or twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) filled from the decanter. <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid the
wine is not very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow. <div class="bookquote">``But one can't get good
wine in lodgings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not thinking very much about it, Mrs. Greenow; that's the truth,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain. <div class="bookquote">``I daresay the wine is very good of its kind.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then
there was another period of silence between them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you find it rather dull, living in lodgings; don't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>asked the Captain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know quite what you mean by dull, Captain Bellfield; but a
woman circumstanced as I am, can't find her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) life very gay. It's not a
full twelvemonth yet since I lost all that made life desirable, and
sometimes I wonder at myself for holding up as well as I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's wicked to give way to grief too much, Mrs. Greenow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what my dear Kate always says to me, and I'm sure I do
my best to overcome it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Upon this soft tears trickled down her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
cheek, showing in their course that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) at any rate used no paint in
producing that freshness of colour which was one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) great charms.
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) handkerchief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) eyes, and removing it,
smiled faintly on the Captain. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't intend to treat you to such
a scene as this, Captain Bellfield.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is nothing on earth, Mrs. Greenow, I desire so much, as
permission to dry those tears.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Time alone can do that, Captain Bellfield;--time alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But cannot time be aided by love and friendship and affection?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By friendship, yes. What would life be worth without the solace of
friendship?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how much better is the warm glow of love?''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>Captain Bellfield,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) asked this question, deliberately got up, and moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) chair
over to the widow's side. But the widow as deliberately changed her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
position to the corner of a sofa. The Captain did not at once follow
her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>), nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) in any way show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had fled
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much better is the warm glow of love?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said again, contenting
himself with looking into her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) face with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had hoped
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) would have been able to press her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) hand by this time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The warm, glow of love, Captain Bellfield, if you have ever felt
it--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I have ever felt it! Do I not feel it now, Mrs. Greenow? There can
be no longer any mask kept upon my feelings. I never could restrain
the yearnings of my heart when they have been strong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have they often been strong, Captain Bellfield?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; often;--in various scenes of life; on the field of battle--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not know that you had seen active service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What!--not on the plains of Zuzuland, when with fifty picked men
I kept five hundred Caffres at bay for seven weeks;--never knew the
comfort of a bed, or a pillow to my head, for seven long weeks!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for seven weeks?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Did I not see active service at Essiquebo, on the burning coast
of Guiana, when all the wild Africans from the woods rose up to
destroy the colony; or again at the mouth of the Kitchyhomy River,
when I made good the capture of a slaver by my own hand and my own
sword!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I really hadn't heard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I understand. I know. Cheesy is the best fellow in the world in
some respects, but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) cannot bring himself to speak well of a fellow
behind his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) back. I know who has belittled me. Who was the first to
storm the heights of Inkerman?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>demanded the Captain, thinking in the
heat of the moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) might as well be hung for a sheep as a
lamb.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But when you spoke of yearnings, I thought you meant yearnings of a
softer kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I did. So I did. I don't know why I have been led away to speak
of deeds that are very seldom mentioned, at any rate by myself. But I
cannot bear that a slanderous backbiting tongue should make you think
that I have seen no service. I have served her (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) Majesty in the four
quarters of the globe, Mrs. Greenow; and now I am ready to serve you
in any way in which you will allow me to make my service acceptable.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Whereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) took one stride over to the sofa, and went down upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
knees before her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Captain Bellfield, I don't want any services. Pray get up now;
the girl will come in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I care nothing for any girl. I am planted here till some answer
shall have been made to me; till some word shall have been said
that may give me a little hope.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) attempted to get hold
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) hand, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) put them behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) back and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``Arabella,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``will you not speak a word to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a word, Captain Bellfield, till you get up; and I won't have you
call me Arabella. I am the widow of Samuel Greenow, than whom no man
was more respected where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was known, and it is not fitting that I
should be addressed in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I want you to become my wife,--and then--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, then indeed! But that then isn't likely to come. Get up, Captain
Bellfield, or I'll push you over and then ring the bell. A man never
looks so much like a fool as when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s kneeling down,--unless he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s
saying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prayers, as you ought to be doing now. Get up, I tell you.
It's just half past seven, and I told Jeannette to come to me then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div><p/>There was that in the widow's voice which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) get up, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
rose slowly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``You've pushed all the chairs about, you
stupid man,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) said. Then in one minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had restored the
scattered furniture to their proper places, and had rung the bell.
When Jeannette came she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) desired that tea might be ready by the time
that the young ladies returned, and asked Captain Bellfield if a cup
should be set for him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). This he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) declined, and bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) farewell while
Jeannette was still in the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) shook hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) without
any sign of anger, and even expressed a hope that they might see him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
again before long.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a very handsome man, is the Captain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>said Jeannette, as the
hero of the Kitchyhomy River descended the stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't think about handsome men, child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'm sure I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>said Jeannette. <div class="bookquote">``Not no more than anybody
else; but if a man is handsome, ma'am, why it stands to reason that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is handsome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose Captain Bellfield has given you a kiss and a pair of
gloves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As for gloves and such like, Mr. Cheesacre is much better for giving
than the Captain; as we all know; don't we, ma'am? But in regard to
kisses, they're presents as I never takes from anybody. Let everybody
pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) debts. If the Captain ever gets a wife, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div><p/>On the following Tuesday morning Mr. Cheesacre as usual called in the
Close, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) no basket. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) merely left a winter
nosegay made of green leaves and laurestinus flowers, and sent up a
message to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) should call at half past three, and hoped that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) might then be able to see Mrs. Greenow--on particular business.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That means you, Kate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it doesn't; it doesn't mean me at all. At any rate he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) won't see
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say it's me he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) wishes to see. It seems to be the fashionable
plan now for gentlemen to make offers by deputy. If he (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>) says anything,
I can only refer him (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>) to you, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you can; you can tell him (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>) simply that I won't have him (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>)
is no more thinking of me than--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Than he (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>) is of me, you were going to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, aunt; I wasn't going to say that at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we shall see. If he (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>) does mean anything, of course you can
please yourself; but I really think you might do worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if I don't want to do at all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; you must have your own way. I can only tell you what I
think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div><p/>At half past three o'clock punctually Mr. Cheesacre came to the
door, and was shown up-stairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was told by Jeannette that Captain
Bellfield had looked in on the Sunday afternoon, but that Miss
Fairstairs and Miss Vavasor had been there the whole time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had
not got on his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) black boots nor yet had his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) round topped hat. And as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) did wear a new frock coat, and had his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) left hand thrust into a
kid glove, Jeannette was quite sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) intended business of
some kind. With new boots, creaking loudly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) walked up into the
drawing-room, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) found the widow alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks for the flowers,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) said at once. <div class="bookquote">``It was so good of you to
bring something that we could accept.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I don't see why you should scruple about a
trifle of cream, but I hope that any such feeling as that will be
over before long.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>To this the widow made no answer, but she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) looked
very sweetly on him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) sit down.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) did sit down; but first he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) hat and stick carefully away in
one corner, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) pulled off his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) glove--somewhat laboriously,
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) hand was warm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was clearly prepared for great things. As
he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) pushed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) hair with his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) hands there came from his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) locks an
ambrosial perfume,--as of marrow-oil, and there was a fixed propriety
of position of every hair of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) whiskers, which indicated very
plainly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had been at a hairdresser's shop since he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) left the
market. Nor do I believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had worn that coat when he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) came to
the door earlier in the morning. If I were to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had called
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) tailor's also, I do not think that I should be wrong.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How goes everything at Oileymead?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow, seeing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
guest wanted some little assistance in leading off the conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty well, Mrs. Greenow; pretty well. Everything will go very well
if I am successful in the object which I have on hand to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I hope you'll be successful in all your undertakings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In all my business undertakings I am, Mrs. Greenow. There isn't a
shilling due on my land to e'er a bank in Norwich; and I haven't
thrashed out a quarter of last year's corn yet, which is more than
many of them can say. But there ain't many of them who don't have to
pay rent, and so perhaps I oughtn't to boast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that Providence has been very good to you, Mr. Cheesacre, as
regards worldly matters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I haven't left it all to Providence, either. Those who do,
generally go to the wall, as far as I can see. I'm always at work
late and early, and I know when I get a profit out of a man's labour
and when I don't, as well as though it was my only chance of bread
and cheese.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I always thought you understood farming business, Mr. Cheesacre.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do. I like a bit of fun well enough, when the time for it
comes, as you saw at Yarmouth. And I keep my three or four hunters,
as I think a country gentleman should; and I shoot over my own
ground. But I always stick to my work. There are men, like Bellfield,

<p/>CHAPTER XXI.

<p/>Alice Is Taught to Grow Upwards, Towards the Light.


<p/>Before the day came on which Alice was to go to Matching Priory, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had often regretted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been induced to make the promise,
and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had as often resolved that there was no possible reason
why she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should not go to Matching Priory. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) feared this
commencement of a closer connection with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) great relations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had told herself so often that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was quite separated from them,
that the slight accident of blood in no way tied her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to them or them
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),--this lesson had been so thoroughly taught to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) by the
injudicious attempts of Lady Macleod to teach an opposite lesson,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not like the idea of putting aside the effect of that
teaching. And perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was a little afraid of the great folk whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might probably meet at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin's house. Lady Glencora herself
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had liked,--and had loved too with that momentary love which
certain circumstances of our life will sometimes produce, a love
which is strong while it lasts, but which can be laid down when the
need of it is passed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had liked and loved Lady Glencora, and had
in no degree been afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) during those strange visitings in
Queen Anne Street;--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was by no means sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) should like
Lady Glencora in the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) grandeur and surrounded by the pomp
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) rank. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would have no other friend or acquaintance in that
house, and feared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) might find herself desolate, cold, and
wounded in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) pride. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had been tricked into the visit, too, or
rather had tricked herself into it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had been sure that there had
been a joint scheme between her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) cousin and Lady Midlothian, and could
not resist the temptation of repudiating it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) letter to Lady
Glencora. But there had been no such scheme; she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had wronged Lady
Glencora, and had therefore been unable to resist her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) second request.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) felt unhappy, fearing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would be out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) element,
and more than once half made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) mind to excuse herself.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) aunt had, from the first, thought well of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) going, believing
that it might probably be the means of reconciling her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) to Mr. Grey.
Moreover, it was a step altogether in the right direction. Lady
Glencora would, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) lived, become a Duchess, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was
decidedly Alice's cousin, of course Alice should go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) house when
invited. It must be acknowledged that Lady Macleod was not selfish
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) worship of rank. She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had played out her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) game in life, and
there was no probability that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) would live to be called cousin by
a Duchess of Omnium. She (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) bade Alice go to Matching Priory, simply
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) niece, and therefore wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to live in the
best and most eligible way within her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) reach. <div class="bookquote">``I think you owe it as a
duty to your family to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div>said Lady Macleod.

<p/>What further correspondence about her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) affairs had passed between Lady
Macleod and Lady Midlothian Alice never knew. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) steadily refused
all entreaty made that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) would answer the Countess's letter, and
at last threatened her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) aunt that if the request were further urged
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) would answer it,--telling Lady Midlothian that she (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) had been very
impertinent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am becoming a very old woman, Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the poor lady said,
piteously, <div class="bookquote">``and I suppose I had better not interfere any further.
Whatever I have said I have always meant to be for your good.''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>Then
Alice got up, and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) aunt, tried to explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
resented no interference from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and felt grateful for all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
both said and did; but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not endure meddling from people
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not know, and who thought themselves entitled to meddle
by their rank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And because they are cousins as well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div>said Lady Macleod, in a
softly sad, apologetic voice.

<p/>Alice left Cheltenham about the middle of November on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) road to
Matching Priory. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was to sleep in London one night, and go down to
Matching in Yorkshire with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) maid on the following day. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father
undertook to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) at the Great Western Station, and to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
on the following morning to the Great Northern. He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) said nothing in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) letter about dining with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), muttered
something about an engagement, and taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) home graciously
promised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) would breakfast with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) on the following morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very glad you are going, Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) said when they were in the
cab together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, papa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?--because I think it's the proper thing to do. You know I've
never said much to you about these people. They're not connected with
me, and I know that they hate the name of Vavasor;--not but what the
name is a deal older than any of theirs, and the family too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And therefore I don't understand why you think I'm specially right.
If you were to say I was specially wrong, I should be less surprised,
and of course I shouldn't go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should go by all means. Rank and wealth are advantages, let
anybody say what they will to the contrary. Why else does everybody
want to get them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I shan't get them by going to Matching Priory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll get part of their value. Take them as a whole, the nobility
of England are pleasant acquaintances to have. I haven't run after
them very much myself, though I married, as I may say, among them.
That very thing rather stood in my way than otherwise. But you may be
sure of this, that men and women ought to grow, like plants, upwards.
Everybody should endeavour to stand as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>) can in the world,
and if I had a choice of acquaintance between a sugar-baker and a
peer, I should prefer the peer,--unless, indeed, the sugar-baker
had something very strong on his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) side to offer. I don't call that
tuft-hunting, and it does not necessitate toadying. It's simply
growing up, towards the light, as the trees do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father's worldly wisdom with a smile, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
did not attempt to answer him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). It was very seldom, indeed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
took upon himself the labour of lecturing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), or that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
even as much counsel as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had given now. <div class="bookquote">``Well, papa, I hope I shall
find myself growing towards the light,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got out of
the cab. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had not entered the house, but had taken the cab on
with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) club.

<p/>On her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) table Alice found a note from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin George. <div class="bookquote">``I hear you
are going down to the Pallisers at Matching Priory to-morrow, and as
I shall be glad to say one word to you before you go, will you let
me see you this evening,--say at nine?--G. V.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt immediately
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not help seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) greatly regretted the
necessity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wished that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had gone directly from Cheltenham to
the North,--regardless even of those changes of wardrobe which her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
purposed visit required. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) set herself to considering. How had
George heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) visit to the Priory, and how had he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) learned the
precise evening which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would pass in London? Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) be so
intent on watching all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) movements as it seemed that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was? As to
seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had no alternative, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) completed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) arrangements
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) journey before nine, and then awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) in the
drawing-room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm so glad you're going to Matching Priory,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>were the first words
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), too, might have taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to grow towards the light,
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) reasons;--but this she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not do just
then.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you learn that I was going?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard it from a friend of mine. Well;--from Burgo Fitzgerald, if
you must know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From Mr. Fitzgerald?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, in profound astonishment: <div class="bookquote">``How
could Mr. Fitzgerald have heard of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's more than I know, Alice. Not directly from Lady Glencora, I
should say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be impossible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; quite so, no doubt. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) keeps up her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) intimacy with
Burgo's sister, and perhaps it got round to him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And did he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) tell you also that I was going to-morrow? He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) must have
known all about it very accurately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; then I asked Kate, and Kate told me when you were going. Yes; I
know. Kate has been wrong, hasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)? Kate was cautioned, no doubt,
to say nothing about your comings and goings to so inconsiderable
a person as myself. But you must not be down upon Kate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) never
mentioned it till I showed by my question to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) that I knew all
about your journey to Matching. I own I do not understand why it
should be necessary to keep me so much in the dark.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was blushing. The caution had been given to Kate
because Kate still transgressed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) letters, by saying little
words about her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother. And Alice did not even now believe Kate
to have been false to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) herself had been
imprudent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot understand it,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>continued George, speaking without looking
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It was but the other day that we were such dear friends! Do
you remember the balcony at Basle? and now it seems that we are quite
estranged;--nay, worse than estranged; that I am, as it were, under
some ban. Have I done anything to offend you, Alice? If so, speak
out, like a woman of spirit as you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why am I tabooed? Why was I told the other day that I might not
congratulate you on your happy emancipation? I say boldly, that had
you resolved on that while we were together in Switzerland, you would
have permitted me, as a friend, almost as a brother, to discuss it
with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think not, George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you would. And why has Kate been warned not to tell me of
this visit to the Pallisers? I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) has been warned though she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
has not confessed it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice sat silent, not knowing what to say in answer to this charge
brought against her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),--thinking, perhaps, that the questioner would
allow his (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) question to pass without an answer. But Vavasor was not so
complaisant. <div class="bookquote">``If there be any reason, Alice, I think that I have a
right to ask it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>For a few seconds she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) did not speak a word, but sat considering.
He (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) also remained silent with his (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) eyes fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) looked
at him (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) and saw nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) scar,--nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) scar and the
brightness of his (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) eyes, which was almost fierce. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) was
in earnest, and therefore resolved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would be in earnest also.
<div class="bookquote">``I think that you have such a right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) said at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then let me exercise it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think that you have such a right, but I think also that you are
ungenerous to exercise it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot understand that. By heavens, Alice, I cannot be left in
this suspense! If I have done anything to offend you, perhaps I can
remove the offence by apology.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have done nothing to offend me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or if there be any cause why our friendship should be dropped,--why
we should be on a different footing to each other in London than we
were in Switzerland, I may acknowledge it, if it be explained to me.
But I cannot put up with the doubt, when I am told that I have a
right to demand its solution.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I will be frank with you, George, though my being so will, as
you may guess, be very painful.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) paused again, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>)
to see if yet he (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) would spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) was all scar and eyes as
before, and there was no mercy in his (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your sister, George, has thought that my parting with Mr. Grey
might lead to a renewal of a purpose of marriage between you and me.
You know her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) eagerness, and will understand that it may have been
necessary that I should require silence from her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) on that head. You
ought now to understand it all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I then am being punished for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sins,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) said; and suddenly the
scar on his (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) face was healed up again, and there was something of the
old pleasantness in his (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have said nothing about any sins, George, but I have found it
necessary to be on my guard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) said, after a short pause, <div class="bookquote">``You are an honest woman,
Alice,--the honestest I ever knew. I will bring Kate to order,--and,
now, we may be friends again; may we not?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) extended his (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) hand
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) across the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``certainly, if you wish it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) spoke doubtingly,
with indecision in her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) voice, as though remembering at the moment
that he (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) no pledge. <div class="bookquote">``I certainly do wish it very much,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>); and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I may now talk about your new freedom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``no. Do not speak of that. A woman does not do what I
have done in that affair without great suffering. I have to think of
it daily; but do not make me speak of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But this other subject, this visit to Matching; surely I may speak
of that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>There was something now in his (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) voice so bright, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
felt the influence of it, and answered him (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) cheerfully, <div class="bookquote">``I don't see
what you can have to say about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I have a great deal. I am so glad you are going. Mind you cement
a close intimacy with Mr. Palliser.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With Mr. Palliser?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; with Mr. Palliser. You must read all the blue books about
finance. I'll send them to you if you like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, George!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm quite in earnest. That is, not in earnest about the blue books,
as you would not have time; but about Mr. Palliser. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) will be the new
Chancellor of the Exchequer without a doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) indeed? But why should I make a bosom friend of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer. I don't want any public money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do, my girl. Don't you see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I shall get returned at this next election.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I hope you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if I do, of course it will be my game to support the
ministry;--or rather the new ministry; for of course there will be
changes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope they will be on the right side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a doubt of that, Alice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish they might be changed altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! that's impossible. It's very well as a dream; but there are no
such men as you want to see,--men really from the people,--strong
enough to take high office. A man can't drive four horses because
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a philanthropist,--or rather a philhorseophist, and is desirous
that the team should be driven without any hurt to them. A man can't
govern well, simply because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is genuinely anxious that men should
be well governed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And will there never be any such men?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't say that. I don't mind confessing to you that it is my
ambition to be such a one myself. But a child must crawl before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
can walk. Such a one as I, hoping to do something in politics, must
spare no chance. It would be something to me that Mr. Palliser should
become the friend of any dear friend of mine,--especially of a dear
friend bearing the same name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid, George, you'll find me a bad hand at making any such
friendship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They say he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is led immensely by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is very
clever. But I mean this chiefly, Alice, that I do hope I shall have
all your sympathy in any political career that I may make, and all
your assistance also.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My sympathy I think I can promise you. My assistance, I fear, would
be worthless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By no means worthless, Alice; not if I see you take that place in
the world which I hope to see you fill. Do you think women nowadays
have no bearing upon the politics of the times? Almost as much as men
have.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>In answer to which Alice shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head; but, nevertheless,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt in some way pleased and flattered.

<p/>George left her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) without saying a word more about her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) marriage
prospects past or future, and Alice as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went to bed felt glad that
this explanation between them had been made.




<p/>CHAPTER XXII.

<p/>Dandy and Flirt.


<p/>Alice reached the Matching Road Station about three o'clock in the
afternoon without adventure, and immediately on the stopping of the
train became aware that all trouble was off her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own hands. A servant
in livery came to the open window, and touching his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) hat to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),
inquired if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) were Miss Vavasor. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) dressing-bag and shawls
and cloaks were taken from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was conveyed through the
station by the station-master on one side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), the footman on the
other, and by the railway porter behind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) instantly perceived that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had become possessed of great privileges by belonging even for a
time to Matching Priory, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was essentially growing upwards
towards the light.

<p/>Outside, on the broad drive before the little station, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) saw an
omnibus that was going to the small town of Matching, intended for
people who had not grown upwards as had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) lot; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) saw
also a light stylish-looking cart which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would have called a
Whitechapel had she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) been properly instructed in such matters, and
a little low open carriage with two beautiful small horses, in
which was sitting a lady enveloped in furs. Of course this was Lady
Glencora. Another servant was standing on the ground, holding the
horses of the carriage and the cart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Alice, I'm so glad you've come,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a voice from the
furs. <div class="bookquote">``Look here, dear; your maid can go in the dog-cart with
your things,'' (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>--it wasn't a dog-cart, but Lady Glencora knew no
better;--<div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)'ll be quite comfortable there; and do you get in here.
Are you very cold?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no; not cold at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is awfully cold. You've been in the stuffy carriage, but
you'll find it cold enough out here, I can tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Lady Glencora, I am so sorry that I've brought you out on such
a morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, getting in and taking the place assigned her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
next to the charioteer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What nonsense! Sorry! Why I've looked forward to meeting you all
alone, ever since I knew you were coming. If it had snowed all the
morning I should have come just the same. I drive out almost every
day when I'm down here,--that is, when the house is not too crowded,
or I can make an excuse. Wrap these things over you; there are plenty
of them. You shall drive if you like.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice, however, declined the
driving, expressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) gratitude in what prettiest words she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could
find.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like driving better than anything, I think. Mr. Palliser doesn't
like ladies to hunt, and of course it wouldn't do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) does not hunt
himself. I do ride, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) never gets on horseback. I almost fancy I
should like to drive four-in-hand,--only I know I should be afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would look very terrible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; wouldn't it? The look would be the worst of it; as it is all
the world over. Sometimes I wish there were no such things as looks.
I don't mean anything improper, you know; only one does get so
hampered, right and left, for fear of Mrs. Grundy. I endeavour to go
straight, and get along pretty well on the whole, I suppose. Baker,
you must put Dandy in the bar; he (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) pulls so, going home, that I can't
hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) in the check.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) stopped the horses, and Baker, a very
completely-got-up groom of some forty years of age, who sat behind,
got down and put the impetuous Dandy <div class="bookquote">``in the bar,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dandy</b></font>)</div>thereby changing
the rein, so that the curb was brought to bear on him (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``They're
called Dandy and Flirt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>continued Lady Glencora, speaking to Alice.
<div class="bookquote">``Ain't they a beautiful match? The Duke gave them to me and named
them himself. Did you ever see the Duke?''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``Baker, you must put Dandy in the bar.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) won't be here before Christmas, but you shall be introduced some
day in London. He (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>)'s an excellent creature and I'm a great pet of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>);
though, after all, I never speak half a dozen words to him (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) when I see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>)'s one of those people who never talk. I'm one of those who
like talking, as you'll find out. I think it runs in families; and
the Pallisers are non-talkers. That doesn't mean that they are not
speakers, for Mr. Palliser has plenty to say in the House, and they
declare that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)'s one of the few public men who've got lungs enough
to make a financial statement without breaking down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice was aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had as yet hardly spoken herself, and
began to bethink herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) didn't know what to say. Had Lady
Glencora paused on the subject of Dandy and Flirt, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) might have
managed to be enthusiastic about the horses, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could not
discuss freely the general silence of the Palliser family, nor the
excellent lungs, as regarded public purposes, of the one who was
the husband of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) present friend. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) asked how far it was to
Matching Priory.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not tired of me already, I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``I delight in the drive. But
somehow one expects Matching Station to be near Matching.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes; that's a great cheat. It's not Matching Station at all
but Matching Road Station, and it's eight miles. It is a great bore,
for though the omnibus brings our parcels, we have to be constantly
sending over, and it's very expensive, I can assure you. I want Mr.
Palliser to have a branch, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would have to take all the
shares himself, and that would cost more, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there a town at Matching?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, a little bit of a place. I'll go round by it if you like, and in
at the further gate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but I should like. It was a borough once, and belonged to the
Duke; but they put it out at the Reform Bill. They made some kind of
bargain;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was to keep either Silverbridge or Matching, but not
both. Mr. Palliser sits for Silverbridge, you know. The Duke chose
Silverbridge,--or rather his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) father did, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was then going to
build his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) great place in Barsetshire;--that's near Silverbridge. But
the Matching people haven't forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) yet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was sitting for
Matching himself when the Reform Bill passed. Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) father died,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) hasn't lived there much since. It's a great deal nicer place
than Gatherum Castle, only not half so grand. I hate grandeur; don't
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never tried much of it, as you have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come now; that's not fair. There's no one in the world less grand
than I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean that I've not had grand people about me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Having cut all your cousins,--and Lady Midlothian in particular,
like a naughty girl as you are. I was so angry with you when you
accused me of selling you about that. You ought to have known that
I was the last person in the world to have done such a thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not think you meant to sell me, but I thought--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you did, Alice. I know what you thought; you thought that Lady
Midlothian was making a tool of me that I might bring you under her (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>)
thumb, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) might bully you into Mr. Grey's arms. That's what
you thought. I don't know that I was at all entitled to your good
opinion, but I was not entitled to that special bad opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had no bad opinion;--but it was so necessary that I should guard
myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall be guarded. I'll take you under my shield. Mr. Grey shan't
be named to you, except that I shall expect you to tell me all about
it; and you must tell me all about that dangerous cousin, too, of
whom they were saying such terrible things down in Scotland. I had
heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) before.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>These last words Lady Glencora spoke in a lower
voice and in an altered tone,--slowly, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) were thinking of
something that pained her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>). It was from Burgo Fitzgerald that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had
heard of George Vavasor.

<p/>Alice did not know what to say. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found it impossible to discuss
all the most secret and deepest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) feelings out in that open
carriage, perhaps in the hearing of the servant behind, on this her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
first meeting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin,--of whom, in fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew very
little. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had not intended to discuss these things at all, and
certainly not in such a manner as this. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) remained silent. <div class="bookquote">``This
is the beginning of the park,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, pointing to a
grand old ruin of an oak tree, which stood on the wide margin of the
road, outside the rounded corner of the park palings, propped up with
a skeleton of supporting sticks all round it. <div class="bookquote">``And that is Matching
oak, under which Coeur de Lion or Edward the Third, I forget which,
was met by Sir Guy de Palisere as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) came from the war, or from
hunting, or something of that kind. It was the king, you know, who
had been fighting or whatever it was, and Sir Guy entertained him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was very tired. Jeffrey Palliser, who is my husband's cousin,
says that old Sir Guy luckily pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) brandy-flask. But the
king immediately gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) all the lands of Matching,--only there was
a priory then and a lot of monks, and I don't quite understand how
that was. But I know one of the younger brothers always used to be
abbot and sit in the House of Lords. And the king gave him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) Littlebury
at the same time, which is about seven miles away from here. As
Jeffrey Palliser says, it was a great deal of money for a pull at his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
flask. Jeffrey Palliser is here now, and I hope you'll like him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). If
I have no child, and Mr. Palliser were not to marry again, Jeffrey
would be the heir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And here again her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) voice was low and slow, and
altogether changed in its tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose that's the way most of the old families got their
estates.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Either so, or by robbery. Many of them were terrible thieves, my
dear, and I dare say Sir Guy was no better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) should be. But
since that they have always called some of the Pallisers Plantagenet.
My husband's name is Plantagenet. The Duke is called George
Plantagenet, and the king was his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) godfather. The queen is my
godmother, I believe, but I don't know that I'm much the better for
it. There's no use in godfathers and godmothers;--do you think there
is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much as it's managed now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had a child,-- Oh, Alice, it's a dreadful thing not to have a
child when so much depends on it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you're such a short time married yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well; I can see it in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eyes when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) asks me questions; but I
don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'d say an unkind word, not if his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own position depended
on it. Ah, well; this is Matching. That other gate we passed, where
Dandy wanted to turn in,--that's where we usually go up, but I've
brought you round to show you the town. That's the inn,--whoever can
possibly come to stay there I don't know; I never saw anybody go in
or out. That's the baker who bakes our bread,--we baked it at the
house at first, but nobody could eat it; and I know that that man
there mends Mr. Palliser's shoes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)'s very particular about his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
shoes. We shall see the church as we go in at the other gate. It
is in the park, and is very pretty,--but not half so pretty as the
priory ruins close to the house. The ruins are our great lion. I do
so love to wander about them at moonlight. I often think of you when
I do; I don't know why.--But I do know why, and I'll tell you some
day. Come, Miss Flirt!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/>As they drove up through the park, Lady Glencora pointed out first
the church and then the ruins, through the midst of which the road
ran, and then they were at once before the front door. The corner
of the modern house came within two hundred yards of the gateway of
the old priory. It was a large building, very pretty, with two long
fronts; but it was no more than a house. It was not a palace, nor a
castle, nor was it hardly to be called a mansion. It was built with
gabled roofs, four of which formed the side from which the windows of
the drawing-rooms opened out upon a lawn which separated the house
from the old ruins, and which indeed surrounded the ruins, and went
inside them, forming the present flooring of the old chapel, and
the old refectory, and the old cloisters. Much of the cloisters
indeed was standing, and there the stone pavement remained; but the
square of the cloisters was all turfed, and in the middle of it stood
a large modern stone vase, out of the broad basin of which hung
flowering creepers and green tendrils.

<p/>As Lady Glencora drove up to the door, a gentleman, who had heard the
sound of the wheels, came forth to meet them. <div class="bookquote">``There's Mr. Palliser,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``that shows that you are an honoured guest, for you may
be sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) is hard at work and would not have come out for
anybody else. Plantagenet, here is Miss Vavasor, perished. Alice, my
husband.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then Mr. Palliser put forth his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hand and helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) out of
the carriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you've not found it very cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The winter has come
upon us quite suddenly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said nothing more to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) than this, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) again before
dinner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was a tall thin man, apparently not more than thirty years
of age, looking in all respects like a gentleman, but with nothing in
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) appearance that was remarkable. It was a face that you might see
and forget, and see again and forget again; and yet when you looked
at it and pulled it to pieces, you found that it was a fairly good
face, showing intellect in the forehead, and much character in the
mouth. The eyes too, though not to be called bright, had always
something to say for themselves, looking as though they had a real
meaning. But the outline of the face was almost insignificant, being
too thin; and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wore no beard to give it character. But, indeed, Mr.
Palliser was a man who had never thought of assisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) position in
the world by his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) outward appearance. Not to be looked at, but to be
read about in the newspapers, was his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) ambition. Men said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was
to be Chancellor of the Exchequer, and no one thought of suggesting
that the insignificance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) face would stand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are the people all out?''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The men have not come in from shooting;--at least I think not;--and
some of the ladies are driving, I suppose. But I haven't seen anybody
since you went.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you haven't. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) never has time, Alice, to see any one.
But we'll go up-stairs, dear. I told them to let us have tea in my
dressing-room, as I thought you'd like that better than going into
the drawing-room before you had taken off your things. You must be
famished, I know. Then you can come down, or if you want to avoid
two dressings you can sit over the fire up-stairs till dinner-time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So saying she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) skipped up-stairs and Alice followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Here's my
dressing-room, and here's your room all but opposite. You look out
into the park. It's pretty, isn't it? But come into my dressing-room,
and see the ruins out of the window.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice followed Lady Glencora across the passage into what she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
called her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) dressing-room, and there found herself surrounded by
an infinitude of feminine luxuries. The prettiest of tables were
there;--the easiest of chairs;--the most costly of cabinets;--the
quaintest of old china ornaments. It was bright with the gayest
colours,--made pleasant to the eye with the binding of many books,
having nymphs painted on the ceiling and little Cupids on the doors.
<div class="bookquote">``Isn't it pretty?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, turning quickly on Alice. <div class="bookquote">``I call it
my dressing-room because in that way I can keep people out of it,
but I have my brushes and soap in a little closet there, and my
clothes,--my clothes are everywhere I suppose, only there are none
of them here. Isn't it pretty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very pretty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Duke did it all. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) understands such things thoroughly. Now
to Mr. Palliser a dressing-room is a dressing-room, and a bedroom a
bedroom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) cares for nothing being pretty; not even his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
wouldn't have married me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't say that if you meant it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't know. Sometimes when I look at myself, when I simply
am myself, with no making up or grimacing, you know, I think I'm the
ugliest young woman the sun ever shone on. And in ten years' time
I shall be the ugliest old woman. Only think,--my hair is beginning
to get grey, and I'm not twenty-one yet. Look at it;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) lifted
up the wavy locks just above her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ear. <div class="bookquote">``But there's one comfort; he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
doesn't care about beauty. How old are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Over five-and-twenty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense;--then I oughtn't to have asked you. I am so sorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's nonsense at any rate. Why should you think I should be
ashamed of my age?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know why, only somehow, people are; and I didn't think you
were so old. Five-and-twenty seems so old to me. It would be nothing
if you were married; only, you see, you won't get married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I may yet; some day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you will. You'll have to give way. You'll find that
they'll get the better of you. Your father will storm at you, and
Lady Macleod will preach at you, and Lady Midlothian will jump upon
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not a bit afraid of Lady Midlothian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what it is, my dear, to be jumped upon. We talked with such
horror of the French people giving their daughters in marriage, just
as they might sell a house or a field, but we do exactly the same
thing ourselves. When they all come upon you in earnest how are you
to stand against them? How can any girl do it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I shall be able.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure you're older,--and you are not so heavily weighted. But
never mind; I didn't mean to talk about that;--not yet at any rate.
Well, now, my dear, I must go down. The Duchess of St. Bungay is here,
and Mr. Palliser will be angry if I don't do pretty to her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>). The Duke
is to be the new President of the Council, or rather, I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>)
is President now. I try to remember it all, but it is so hard when
one doesn't really care two pence how it goes. Not but what I'm very
anxious that Mr. Palliser should be Chancellor of the Exchequer. And
now, will you remain here, or will you come down with me, or will you
go to your own room, and I'll call for you when I go down to dinner?
We dine at eight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice decided that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would stay in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own room till dinner time,
and was taken there by Lady Glencora. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) maid unpacking
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) clothes, and for a while employed herself in assisting at the
work; but that was soon done, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was left alone. <div class="bookquote">``I shall
feel so strange, ma'am, among all those people down-stairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the
girl. <div class="bookquote">``They all seem to look at me as though they didn't know who I
was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll get over that soon, Jane.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I shall; but you see, they're all like knowing each other,
miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat down alone, felt herself to be very much in the
same condition as her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) maid. What would the Duchess of St. Bungay or Mr.
Jeffrey Palliser,--who himself might live to be a duke if things went
well for him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>),--care for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)? As to Mr. Palliser, the master of the
house, it was already evident to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would not put himself
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) way for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) not done wrong to come there? If it
were possible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to fly away, back to the dullness of Queen Anne
Street, or even to the preachings of Lady Macleod, would she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) not do
so immediately? What business had she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>),--she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) asked herself,--to come
to such a house as that? Lady Glencora was very kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), but
frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) even by her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) kindness. Moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was aware that
Lady Glencora could not devote herself especially to any such guest
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was. Lady Glencora must of course look after her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) duchesses,
and do pretty, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) called it, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband's important political
alliances.

<p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) began to think about Lady Glencora herself. What a
strange, weird nature she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was,--with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) round blue eyes and wavy
hair, looking sometimes like a child and sometimes almost like an old
woman! And how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) talked! What things she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, and what terrible
forebodings she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) uttered of stranger things that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) meant to say! Why
had she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at their first meeting made that allusion to the mode of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
own betrothal,--and then, checking herself for speaking of it so
soon, almost declare that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) meant to speak more of it hereafter?
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) should never mention it to any one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice to herself.
<div class="bookquote">``If her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) lot in life has not satisfied her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), there is so much the
more reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) should not mention it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Then Alice protested to
herself that no father, no aunt, no Lady Midlothian should persuade
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) into a marriage of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) feared the consequences. But Lady
Glencora had made for herself excuses which were not altogether
untrue. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had been very young, and had been terribly weighted with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) wealth.

<p/>And it seemed to Alice that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) everything in
that hour and a half that they had been together. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had given
a whole history of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) husband and of herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had said how
indifferent he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) pleasures, and how vainly she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) strove to
interest herself in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) pursuits. And then, as yet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was childless
and without prospect of a child, when, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) herself had said,--<div class="bookquote">``so
much depended on it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was very strange to Alice that all this
should have been already told to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). And why should Lady Glencora
think of Alice when she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) walked out among the priory ruins by
moonlight?

<p/>The two hours seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) very long,--as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) were passing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) time in absolute seclusion at Matching. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) did not
dare to go down-stairs. But at last her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) maid came to dress her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you get on below, Jane?''  (<font color='red'><b>mistress</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) mistress asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, miss, they are uncommon civil, and I don't think after all it
will be so bad. We had our teas very comfortable in the housekeeper's
room. There are five or six of us altogether, all ladies'-maids,
miss; and there's nothing on earth to do all the day long, only sit
and do a little needlework over the fire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/>A few minutes before eight Lady Glencora knocked at Alice's door, and
took her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) arm to lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) to the drawing-room. Alice saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was
magnificently dressed, with an enormous expanse of robe, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
locks had been so managed that no one could suspect the presence of
a grey hair. Indeed, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) magnificence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked almost a
child. <div class="bookquote">``Let me see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, as they went down-stairs together.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll tell Jeffrey to take you in to dinner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>)'s about the easiest
young man we have here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) rather turns up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) nose at everything,
but that doesn't make him (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) the less agreeable; does it, dear?--unless
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) turns up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) nose at you, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) won't do that. That would be uncourteous,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>)'s the most
courteous man in the world. There's nobody here, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said
as they entered the room, <div class="bookquote">``and I didn't suppose there would be. It's
always proper to be first in one's own house. I do so try to be
proper,--and it is such trouble. Talking of people earning their
bread, Alice;--I'm sure I earn mine. Oh dear!--what fun it would be
to be sitting somewhere in Asia, eating a chicken with one's fingers,
and lighting a big fire outside one's tent to keep off the lions and
tigers. Fancy your being on one side of the fire and the lions and
tigers on the other, grinning at you through the flames!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then Lady
Glencora strove to look like a lion, and grinned at herself in the
glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That sort of grin wouldn't frighten me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say not. I have been reading about it in that woman's
travels. Oh, here they are, and I mustn't make any more faces.
Duchess, do come to the fire. I hope you've got warm again. This is
my cousin, Miss Vavasor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Duchess</b></font>)</div><p/>The Duchess made a stiff little bow of condescension, and then
declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was charmingly warm. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know how you manage
in your house, but the staircases are so comfortable. Now at
Longroyston we've taken all the trouble in the world,--put down
hot-water pipes all over the house, and everything else that could be
thought of, and yet, you can't move about the place without meeting
with draughts at every corner of the passages.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Duchess</b></font>)</div>The Duchess spoke
with an enormous emphasis on every other word, sometimes putting so
great a stress on some special syllable, as almost to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) voice
to a whistle. This she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) had done with the word <div class="bookquote">``pipes''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>to a great
degree,--so that Alice never afterwards forgot the hot-water pipes
of Longroyston. <div class="bookquote">``I was telling Lady Glencora, Miss Palliser, that
I never knew a house so warm as this,--or, I'm sorry to say,'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--and
here the emphasis was very strong on the word sorry,--<div class="bookquote">``so cold as
Longroyston.''  (<font color='red'><b>a audience</b></font>)</div>And the tone in which Longroyston was uttered would
almost have drawn tears from a critical audience in the pit of a
playhouse. The Duchess was a woman of about forty, very handsome, but
with no meaning in her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) beauty, carrying a good fixed colour in her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>)
face, which did not look like paint, but which probably had received
some little assistance from art. She (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) was a well-built, sizeable
woman, with good proportions and fine health,--but a fool. She (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) had
addressed herself to one Miss Palliser; but two Miss Pallisers,
cousins of Plantagenet Palliser, had entered the room at the same
time, of whom I may say, whatever other traits of character they may
have possessed, that at any rate they were not fools.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's always easy to warm a small house like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Palliser, whose Christian names, unfortunately for her (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), were
Iphigenia Theodata, and who by her (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) cousin and sister was called
Iphy--<div class="bookquote">``and I suppose equally difficult to warm a large one such as
Longroyston.''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>The other Miss Palliser had been christened Euphemia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've got no pipes, Duchess, at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora; and
Alice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) sat listening, thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) discerned in Lady Glencora's
pronunciation of the word pipes an almost hidden imitation of the
Duchess's whistle. It must have been so, for at the moment Lady
Glencora's eye met Alice's for an instant, and was then withdrawn, so
that Alice was compelled to think that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) friend and cousin was not
always quite successful in those struggles she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) made to be proper.

<p/>Then the gentlemen came in one after another, and other ladies, till
about thirty people were assembled. Mr. Palliser came up and spoke
another word to Alice in a kind voice,--meant to express some sense
of connection if not cousinship. <div class="bookquote">``My wife has been thinking so much
of your coming. I hope we shall be able to amuse you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice, who had
already begun to feel desolate, was grateful, and made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mind
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would try to like Mr. Palliser.

<p/>Jeffrey Palliser was almost the last in the room, but directly he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
entered Lady Glencora got up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) seat, and met him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was
coming into the crowd. <div class="bookquote">``You must take my cousin, Alice Vavasor, in
to dinner,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and;--will you oblige me to-day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--as you ask me like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then try to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) comfortable.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>After that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) introduced them,
and Jeffrey Palliser stood opposite to Alice, talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), till
dinner was announced.




<p/>CHAPTER XXIII.

<p/>Dinner at Matching Priory.


<p/>Alice found herself seated near to Lady Glencora's end of the table,
and, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) resolution to like Mr. Palliser, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was not
sorry that such an arrangement had been made. Mr. Palliser had taken
the Duchess out to dinner, and Alice wished to be as far removed
as possible from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) Grace. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found herself seated between her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
bespoken friend Jeffrey Palliser and the Duke, and as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
was seated Lady Glencora introduced her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) second neighbour. <div class="bookquote">``My
cousin, Duke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora said, <div class="bookquote">``and a terrible Radical.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed; I'm glad of that. We're sadly in want of a few leading
Radicals, and perhaps I may be able to gain one now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin George, and wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), instead of
herself, was sitting next to the Duke of St. Bungay. <div class="bookquote">``But I'm afraid
I never shall be a leading Radical,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall lead me at any rate, if you will,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As the little dogs lead the blind men,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Lady Glencora, not so. But as the pretty women lead the men
who have eyes in their head. There is nothing I want so much, Miss
Vavasor, as to become a Radical;--if I only knew how.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it's very easy to know how,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you? I don't. I've voted for every liberal measure that has come
seriously before Parliament since I had a seat in either House, and
I've not been able to get beyond Whiggery yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you voted for the ballot?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>asked Alice, almost trembling at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
own audacity as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) put the question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; no, I've not. And I suppose that is the crux. But the ballot
has never been seriously brought before any House in which I have
sat. I hate it with so keen a private hatred, that I doubt whether
I could vote for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the Radicals love it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Palliser,''  (<font color='red'><b>Duke</b></font>)</div>said the Duke, speaking loudly from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) end of the table,
<div class="bookquote">``I'm told you can never be entitled to call yourself a Radical till
you've voted for the ballot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Duke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to be called a Radical,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser,--<div class="bookquote">``or to be
called anything at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Except Chancellor of the Exchequer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora in a low
voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And that's about the finest ambition by which a man can be moved,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Duke</b></font>)</div>said the Duke. <div class="bookquote">``The man who can manage the purse-strings of this
country can manage anything.''  (<font color='red'><b>Duke</b></font>)</div>Then that conversation dropped and the
Duke ate his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) dinner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was especially commissioned to amuse you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jeffrey
Palliser to Alice. <div class="bookquote">``But when I undertook the task I had no conception
that you would be calling Cabinet Ministers over the coals about
their politics.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did nothing of the kind, surely, Mr. Palliser. I suppose all
Radicals do vote for the ballot, and that's why I said it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your definition was perfectly just, I dare say, only--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Glencora need not have been so anxious to provide specially
for your amusement. Not but what I'm very much obliged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>),--of
course. But Miss Vavasor, unfortunately I'm not a politician. I
haven't a chance of a seat in the House, and so I despise politics.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Women are not allowed to be politicians in this country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God, they can't do much in that way;--not directly, I mean.
Only think where we should be if we had a feminine House of Commons,
with feminine debates, carried on, of course, with feminine courtesy.
My cousins Iphy and Phemy there would of course be members. You don't
know them yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not yet. Are they politicians?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not especially. They have their tendencies, which are decidedly
liberal. There has never been a Tory Palliser known, you know. But
they are too clever to give themselves up to anything in which they
can do nothing. Being women they live a depressed life, devoting
themselves to literature, fine arts, social economy, and the
abstract sciences. They write wonderful letters; but I believe their
correspondence lists are quite full, so that you have no chance at
present of getting on either of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't the slightest pretension to ask for such an honour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! if you mean because you don't know them, that has nothing to do
with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I have no claim either private or public.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That has nothing to do with it either. They don't at all seek people
of note as their correspondents. Free communication with all the
world is their motto, and Rowland Hill is the god they worship.
Only they have been forced to guard themselves against too great an
accession of paper and ink. Are you fond of writing letters, Miss
Vavasor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, to my friends; but I like getting them better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shrewdly suspect they don't read half what they get. Is it
possible any one should go through two sheets of paper filled by our
friend the Duchess there? No; their delight is in writing. They sit
each at her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) desk after breakfast, and go on till lunch. There is a
little rivalry between them, not expressed to each other, but visible
to their friends. Iphy certainly does get off the greater number,
and I'm told crosses quite as often as Phemy, but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) has the
advantage of a bolder and larger hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do they write to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear no. I don't think they ever write to any relative. They
don't discuss family affairs and such topics as that. Architecture
goes a long way with them, and whether women ought to be clerks in
public offices. Iphy has certain American correspondents that take
up much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) time, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) acknowledges she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) does not read their
letters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I certainly shall not write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are not American, I hope. I do hate the Americans. It's the
only strong political feeling I have. I went there once, and found I
couldn't live with them on any terms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But they please themselves. I don't see they are to be hated because
they don't live after our fashion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh; it's jealousy of course. I know that. I didn't come across a
cab-driver who wasn't a much better educated man than I am. And as
for their women, they know everything. But I hated them, and I intend
to hate them. You haven't been there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I will make bold to say that any English lady who spent a month
with them and didn't hate them would have very singular tastes. I
begin to think they'll eat each other up, and then there'll come an
entirely new set of people of a different sort. I always regarded the
States as a Sodom and Gomorrah, prospering in wickedness, on which
fire and brimstone were sure to fall sooner or later.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think that's wicked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am wicked, as Topsy used to say. Do you hunt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you shoot?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shoot! What; with a gun?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I was staying in a house last week with a lady who shot a good
deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I don't shoot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you ride?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I wish I did. I have never ridden because I've no one to ride
with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you drive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I don't drive either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what do you do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I sit at home, and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mend your stockings?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I don't do that, because it's disagreeable; but I do work a good
deal. Sometimes I have amused myself by reading.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah; they never do that here. I have heard that there is a library,
but the clue to it has been lost, and nobody now knows the way. I
don't believe in libraries. Nobody ever goes into a library to read,
any more than you would into a larder to eat. But there is this
difference;--the food you consume does come out of the larders, but
the books you read never come out of the libraries.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Except Mudie's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is the great librarian. And you mean to read all the
time you are here, Miss Vavasor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean to walk about the priory ruins sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you must go by moonlight, and I'll go with you. Only isn't it
rather late in the year for that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think it is,--for you, Mr. Palliser.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Duke</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the Duke spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got on very
well during dinner. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not but feel angry with herself
in that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had any fear on the subject;--and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not
divest herself of that fear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) acknowledged to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was
conscious of a certain inferiority to Lady Glencora and to Mr. Jeffrey
Palliser, which almost made her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) unhappy. As regarded the Duke on the
other side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had no such feeling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was old enough to be
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) father, and was a Cabinet Minister; therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) was entitled
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) reverence. But how was it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could not help accepting
the other people round her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) as being indeed superior to herself? Was
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) really learning to believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could grow upwards by their
sunlight?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jeffrey is a pleasant fellow, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
as they passed back through the billiard-room to the drawing-room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very pleasant;--a little sarcastic, perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think you would soon find yourself able to get the better
of that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) tries it upon you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora; and then the
ladies were all in the drawing-room together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is quite deliciously warm, coming from one room to another,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>said
the Duchess, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) emphasis on the <div class="bookquote">``one''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>and the <div class="bookquote">``other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we had better keep continually moving,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparkes/Mrs. Conway Sparkes</b></font>)</div>said a certain Mrs.
Conway Sparkes, a literary lady, who had been very handsome, who was
still very clever, who was not perhaps very good-natured, and of whom
the Duchess of St. Bungay was rather afraid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope we may be warm here too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But not deliciously warm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparkes/Mrs. Conway Sparkes</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Conway Sparkes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It makes me tremble in every limb when Mrs. Sparkes attacks her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparkes</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora said to Alice in Alice's own room that night, <div class="bookquote">``for I
know she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparkes</b></font>)'ll tell the Duke; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>)'ll tell that tall man with red hair
whom you see standing about, and the tall man with red hair will tell
Mr. Palliser, and then I shall catch it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And who is the tall man with red hair?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a political link between the Duke and Mr. Palliser. His (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) name is
Bott, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)'s a Member of Parliament.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) interfere?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it's his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) business. I don't quite understand all the ins
and outs of it. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)'s to be one of Mr. Palliser's private
secretaries if he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) becomes Chancellor of the Exchequer. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
doesn't tell;--only I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) does all the same. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) always calls me
Lady Glen-cowrer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) comes out of Lancashire, and made calico as long
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could get any cotton.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But this happened in the bedroom, and we
must go back for a while to the drawing-room.

<p/>The Duchess had made no answer to Mrs. Sparkes, and so nothing further
was said about the warmth. Nor, indeed, was there any conversation
that was comfortably general. The number of ladies in the room was
too great for that, and ladies do not divide themselves nicely into
small parties, as men and women do when they are mixed. Lady Glencora
behaved pretty by telling the Duchess all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) pet pheasants;
Mrs. Conway Sparkes told ill-natured tales of some one to Miss
Euphemia Palliser; one of the Duchess's daughters walked off to a
distant piano with an admiring friend and touched a few notes; while
Iphigenia Palliser boldly took up a book, and placed herself at a
table. Alice, who was sitting opposite to Lady Glencora, began to
speculate whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) might do the same; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) courage failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>),
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) sat on, telling herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) element.
<div class="bookquote">``Alice Vavasor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora after a while, suddenly, and in a
somewhat loud voice, <div class="bookquote">``can you play billiards?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, rather startled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you shall learn to-night, and if nobody else will teach you,
you shall be my pupil.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Whereupon Lady Glencora rang the bell and
ordered that the billiard-table might be got ready. <div class="bookquote">``You'll play,
Duchess, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so nice and warm, that I think I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>said the Duchess; but
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) spoke she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) looked suspiciously to that part of the room where
Mrs. Conway Sparkes was sitting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us all play,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparkes/Mrs. Conway Sparkes</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Conway Sparkes, <div class="bookquote">``and then it will be
nicer,--and perhaps warmer, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparkes/Mrs. Conway Sparkes</b></font>)</div><p/>The gentlemen joined them just as they were settling themselves round
the table, and as many of them stayed there, the billiard-room became
full. Alice had first a cue put into her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand, and making nothing
of that was permitted to play with a mace. The duty of instructing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) devolved on Jeffrey Palliser, and the next hour passed
pleasantly;--not so pleasantly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought afterwards, as did some
of those hours in Switzerland when her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousins were with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). After
all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could get more out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) life with such associates as them,
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could with any of these people at Matching. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt quite
sure of that;--though Jeffrey Palliser did take great trouble to
teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) the game, and once or twice made her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) laugh heartily by
quizzing the Duchess's attitude as she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) stood up to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) stroke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could play billiards,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparkes/Mrs. Conway Sparkes</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparkes, on one of these
occasions; <div class="bookquote">``I do indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparkes/Mrs. Conway Sparkes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you said you were coming to play,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>said the Duchess,
almost majestically, and with a tone of triumph evidently produced
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) own successes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only to see your Grace,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparkes/Mrs. Conway Sparkes</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparkes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that there is anything more to see in me than in
anybody else,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>said the Duchess. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Palliser, that was a cannon.
Will you mark that for our side?''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Palliser, that was a cannon.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, Duchess, you hit the same ball twice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well;--then I suppose Miss Vavasor plays now. That was a miss.
Will you mark that, if you please?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>This latter demand was made with
great stress, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) had been defrauded in the matter of the
cannon, and was obeyed. Before long, the Duchess, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) partner,
Lady Glencora, won the game,--which fact, however, was, I think,
owing rather to Alice's ignorance than to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) Grace's skill. The
Duchess, however, was very triumphant, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) way back into the
drawing-room with a step which seemed to declare loudly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) had
trumped Mrs. Sparkes at last.

<p/>Not long after this the ladies went up-stairs on their way to bed.
Many of them, perhaps, did not go to their pillows at once, as it was
as yet not eleven o'clock, and it was past ten when they all came
down to breakfast. At any rate, Alice, who had been up at seven, did
not go to bed then, nor for the next two hours. <div class="bookquote">``I'll come into your
room just for one minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora said as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) passed on from
the door to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) own room; and in about five minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was back with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) cousin. <div class="bookquote">``Would you mind going into my room--it's just there, and
sitting with Ellen for a minute?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>This Lady Glencora said in the
sweetest possible tone to the girl who was waiting on Alice; and
then, when they were alone together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got into a little chair by
the fireside and prepared herself for conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must keep you up for a quarter of an hour while I tell you
something. But first of all, how do you like the people? Will you
be able to be comfortable with them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice of course said that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would; and then there came that little discussion
in which the duties of Mr. Bott, the man with the red hair, were
described.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I've got something to tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, when they
had already been there some twenty minutes. <div class="bookquote">``Sit down opposite to me,
and look at the fire while I look at you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it anything terrible?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's nothing wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Lady Glencora, if it's--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't have you call me Lady Glencora. Don't I call you Alice? Why
are you so unkind to me? I have not come to you now asking you to do
for me anything that you ought not to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are going to tell me something.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice felt sure that the
thing to be told would have some reference to Mr. Fitzgerald, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
did not wish to hear Mr. Fitzgerald's name from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin's lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell you something;--of course I am. I'm going to tell you
that,--that in writing to you the other day I wrote a fib. But it
wasn't that I wished to deceive you;--only I couldn't say it all in
a letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say all what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know I confessed that I had been very bad in not coming to you
in London last year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never thought of it for a moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did not care whether I came or not: was that it? But never mind.
Why should you have cared? But I cared. I told you in my letter that
I didn't come because I had so many things on hand. Of course that
was a fib.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everybody makes excuses of that kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But they don't make them to the very people of all others whom
they want to know and love. I was longing to come to you every day.
But I feared I could not come without speaking of him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>);--and I had
determined never to speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) again.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>This she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said in that
peculiar low voice which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) assumed at times.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why do it now, Lady Glencora?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't be called Lady Glencora. Call me Cora. I had a sister once,
older than I, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) used to call me Cora. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had lived--. But
never mind that now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) didn't live. I'll tell you why I do it now.
Because I cannot help it. Besides, I've met him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>). I've been in the
same room with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>), and have spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>). What's the good of any
such resolution now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have met him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>)--Mr. Palliser--knew all about it. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) talked of taking
me to the house, I whispered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) that I thought Burgo would be
there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not call him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) Christian name,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, almost with a
shudder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?--why not his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) Christian name? I did when I told my husband.
Or perhaps I said Burgo Fitzgerald.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) bade me go. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) said it didn't signify, and that I had better
learn to bear it. Bear it, indeed! If I am to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>), and speak to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>), and look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>), surely I may mention his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) name.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
paused for an answer. <div class="bookquote">``May I not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I to say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything you please, that's not a falsehood. But I've got you here
because I don't think you will tell a falsehood. Oh, Alice, I do so
want to go right, and it is so hard!''

 (<font color='red'><b>creature</b></font>)</div><p/>Hard, indeed, poor creature, for one so weighted as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been, and
sent out into the world with so small advantages of previous training
or of present friendship! Alice began to feel now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been
enticed to Matching Priory because her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin wanted a friend, and
of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not refuse to give the friendship that was asked
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) chair, and kneeling down at the other's
feet put up her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew you would be good to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``I knew you
would. And you may say whatever you like. But I could not bear that
you should not know the real reason why I neither came to you nor
sent for you after we went to London. You'll come to me now; won't
you, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--and you'll come to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, making in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mind a sort
of bargain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was not to be received into Mr. Palliser's house
after the fashion in which Lady Midlothian had proposed to receive
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). But it struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) at once that this was unworthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), and
ungenerous. <div class="bookquote">``But I'll come to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``whether you come to
me or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, <div class="bookquote">``of course,--why shouldn't I?
But you know what I mean. We shall have dinners and parties and lots
of people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And we shall have none,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And therefore there is so much more excuse for your coming to
me;--or rather I mean so much more reason, for I don't want excuses.
Well, dear, I'm so glad I've told you. I was afraid to see you in
London. I should hardly have known how to look at you then. But I've
got over that now.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) smiled and returned the kiss which Alice
had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). It was singular to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) standing on the bedroom rug
with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) magnificence of dress, but with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hair pushed back
behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ears, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes red with tears,--as though the burden
of the magnificence remained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) after its purpose was over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I declare it's ever so much past twelve. Good night, now, dear. I
wonder whether he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s come up. But I should have heard his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) step if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
had. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) never treads lightly. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) seldom gives over work till after
one, and sometimes goes on till three. It's the only thing he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) likes,
I believe. God bless you! good night. I've such a deal more to say to
you; and Alice, you must tell me something about yourself, too; won't
you, dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Then without waiting for an answer Lady Glencora went,
leaving Alice in a maze of bewilderment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could hardly believe
that all she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had heard, and all she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had done, had happened since she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
left Queen Anne Street that morning.




<p/>CHAPTER XXIV.

<p/>Three Politicians.


<p/>Mr. Palliser was one of those politicians in possessing whom England
has perhaps more reason to be proud than of any other of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
resources, and who, as a body, give to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) that exquisite combination
of conservatism and progress which is her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) present strength and best
security for the future. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could afford to learn to be a statesman,
and had the industry wanted for such training. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was born in the
purple, noble himself, and heir to the highest rank as well as one of
the greatest fortunes of the country, already very rich, surrounded
by all the temptations of luxury and pleasure; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) devoted
himself to work with the grinding energy of a young penniless
barrister labouring for a penniless wife, and did so without any
motive more selfish than that of being counted in the roll of
the public servants of England. He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) was not a brilliant man, and
understood well that such was the case. He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) was now listened to in
the House, as the phrase goes; but he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) was listened to as a laborious
man, who was in earnest in what he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) did, who got up his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) facts with
accuracy, and who, dull though he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) be, was worthy of confidence. And
he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) was very dull. He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) rather prided himself on being dull, and on
conquering in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) dullness. He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) never allowed himself a
joke in his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) speeches, nor attempted even the smallest flourish of
rhetoric. He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) was very careful in his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) language, labouring night and
day to learn to express himself with accuracy, with no needless
repetition of words, perspicuously with regard to the special object
he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) might have in view. He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) had taught himself to believe that oratory,
as oratory, was a sin against that honesty in politics by which he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>)
strove to guide himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) desired to use words for the purpose of
teaching things which he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) knew and which others did not know; and he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>)
desired also to be honoured for his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) knowledge. But he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) had no desire
to be honoured for the language in which his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) knowledge was conveyed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) was an upright, thin, laborious man; who by his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) parts alone could
have served no political party materially, but whose parts were
sufficient to make his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) education, integrity, and industry useful in
the highest degree. It is the trust which such men inspire which
makes them so serviceable;--trust not only in their labour,--for any
man rising from the mass of the people may be equally laborious; nor
yet simply in their honesty and patriotism. The confidence is given
to their labour, honesty, and patriotism joined to such a personal
stake in the country as gives them a weight and ballast which no
politician in England can possess without it.

<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>politician</b></font>) was dull as a statesman he (<font color='blue'><b>politician</b></font>) was more dull in private life, and
it may be imagined that such a woman as his (<font color='blue'><b>politician</b></font>) wife would find some
difficulty in making his (<font color='blue'><b>politician</b></font>) society the source of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) happiness. Their
marriage, in a point of view regarding business, had been a complete
success,--and a success, too, when on the one side, that of Lady
Glencora, there had been terrible dangers of shipwreck, and when
on his (<font color='blue'><b>politician</b></font>) side also there had been some little fears of a mishap. As
regards her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) it has been told how near she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) went to throwing herself,
with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) vast wealth, into the arms of a young man, whom no
father, no guardian could have regarded as a well-chosen husband for
any girl;--one who as yet had shown no good qualities, who had been
a spendthrift, unprincipled, and debauched. Alas, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)!
It is possible that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) love and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wealth might have turned him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
from evil to good. But who would have ventured to risk her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),--I will
not say her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) vast inheritances,--on such a chance? That evil,
however, had been prevented, and those about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had managed to marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to a young man, very steady by nature, with worldly prospects as
brilliant as her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own, and with a station than which the world offers
nothing higher. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little threatened mischance,--a passing fancy for
a married lady who was too wise to receive vows which were proffered
not in the most ardent manner,--had, from special reasons, given some
little alarm to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uncle, which had just sufficed at the time to
make so very judicious a marriage doubly pleasant to that noble duke,
So that all things and all people had conspired to shower substantial
comforts on the heads of this couple, when they were joined together,
and men and women had not yet ceased to declare how happy were both
in the accumulated gifts of fortune.

<p/>And as regards Mr. Palliser, I think that his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) married life, and the
wife, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) certainly had not chosen, but who had dropped upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>),
suited him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) admirably. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wanted great wealth for that position at
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) aimed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had been rich before his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) marriage with his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) own
wealth,--so rich that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could throw thousands away if he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wished it;
but for him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) career was needed that colossal wealth which
would make men talk about it,--which would necessitate an expansive
expenditure, reaching far and wide, doing nothing, or less than
nothing, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) own personal comfort, but giving to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) at once that
rock-like solidity which is so necessary to our great aristocratic
politicians. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife was, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) knew, all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
desired. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had not dabbled much in the fountains of Venus, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had forgotten himself once, and sinned in coveting another man's
wife. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) sin then had hardly polluted his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) natural character,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) desire had been of a kind which was almost more gratified in
its disappointment than it would have been in its fruition. On the
morning after the lady had frowned on him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had told himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
was very well out of that trouble. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) knew that it would never be for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) to hang up on the walls of a temple a well-worn lute as a votive
offering when leaving the pursuits of love. _Idoneus puellis_ he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
never could have been. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) married Lady Glencora and was satisfied.
The story of Burgo Fitzgerald was told to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) supposed that
most girls had some such story to tell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) thought little about it,
and by no means understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>), with all the
impressiveness which she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could throw into the words, <div class="bookquote">``You must know
that I have really loved him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You must love me now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had replied
with a smile; and then as regarded his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) mind, the thing was over. And
since his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) marriage he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had thought that things matrimonial had gone
well with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>), and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) almost unlimited power
of enjoying her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) money, and interfered but little in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) way of
life. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) would say a word of caution to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) with reference
to those childish ways which hardly became the dull dignity of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) position; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) words then would have in them something of
unintentional severity,--whether instigated or not by the red-haired
Radical Member of Parliament, I will not pretend to say;--but on
the whole he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) was contented and loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) wife, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) thought, very
heartily, and at least better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) loved any one else. One cause
of unhappiness, or rather one doubt as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) entire good fortune,
was beginning to make itself felt, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) wife had to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sorrow
already discovered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) had hoped that before this he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) might have heard
that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) a child. But the days were young yet for that
trouble, and the care had not become a sorrow.

<p/>But this judicious arrangement as to properties, this well-ordered
alliance between families, had not perhaps suited her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as well as it
had suited him (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>). I think that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might have learned to forget her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
early lover, or to look back upon it with a soft melancholy hardly
amounting to regret, had her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) new lord been more tender in his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) ways
with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). I do not know that Lady Glencora's heart was made of that
stern stuff which refuses to change its impressions; but it was a
heart, and it required food. To love and fondle someone,--to be
loved and fondled, were absolutely necessary to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) happiness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
wanted the little daily assurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) supremacy in the man's
feelings, the constant touch of love, half accidental half contrived,
the passing glance of the eye telling perhaps of some little joke
understood only between them two rather than of love, the softness of
an occasional kiss given here and there when chance might bring them
together, some half-pretended interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) little doings, a nod, a
wink, a shake of the head, or even a pout. It should have been given
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) to feed upon such food as this daily, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would have
forgotten Burgo Fitzgerald. But Mr. Palliser understood none of these
things; and therefore the image of Burgo Fitzgerald in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) beauty
was ever before her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>But not the less was Mr. Palliser a prosperous man, as to the success
of whose career few who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had much doubt. It might be written
in the book of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) destiny that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would have to pass through some
violent domestic trouble, some ruin in the hopes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) home, of a
nature to destroy then and for ever the worldly prospects of other
men. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was one who would pass through such violence, should
it come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), without much scathe. To lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) influence with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) party would be worse to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) than to lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife, and public
disgrace would hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) harder than private dishonour.

<p/>And the present was the very moment in which success was, as was
said, coming to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had already held laborious office under the
Crown, but had never sat in the Cabinet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had worked much harder
than Cabinet Ministers generally work,--but hitherto had worked
without any reward that was worth his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) having. For the stipend which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had received had been nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>),--as the great stipend which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would receive, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hopes were true, would also be nothing to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). To have ascendancy over other men, to be known by his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) countrymen
as one of their real rulers, to have an actual and acknowledged voice
in the management of nations,--those were the rewards for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
looked; and now in truth it seemed as though they were coming to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>).
It was all but known that the existing Chancellor of the Exchequer
would separate himself from the Government, carrying various others
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>), either before or immediately consequent on the meeting
of Parliament;--and it was all but known, also, that Mr. Palliser
would fill his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) place, taking that high office at once, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
had never hitherto sat in that august assembly which men call the
Cabinet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could thus afford to put up with the small everyday
calamity of having a wife who loved another man better than she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) loved
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>The presence of the Duke of St. Bungay at Matching was assumed to be a
sure sign of Mr. Palliser's coming triumph. The Duke was a statesman
of a very different class, but he (<font color='blue'><b>statesman</b></font>) also had been eminently successful
as an aristocratic pillar of the British Constitutional Republic. He (<font color='blue'><b>statesman</b></font>)
was a minister of very many years' standing, being as used to cabinet
sittings as other men are to their own armchairs; but he (<font color='blue'><b>statesman</b></font>) had never
been a hard-working man. Though a constant politician, he (<font color='blue'><b>statesman</b></font>) had ever
taken politics easy whether in office or out. The world had said
before now that the Duke might be Premier, only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Premier</b></font>) would not
take the trouble. He (<font color='blue'><b>Premier</b></font>) had been consulted by a very distinguished
person,--so the papers had said more than once,--as to the making of
Prime Ministers. His (<font color='blue'><b>Premier</b></font>) voice in council was esteemed to be very great.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Premier</b></font>) was regarded as a strong rock of support to the liberal cause, and
yet nobody ever knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Premier</b></font>) did; nor was there much record of what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Premier</b></font>) said. The offices which he (<font color='blue'><b>Premier</b></font>) held, or had held, were generally those
to which no very arduous duties were attached. In severe debates he (<font color='blue'><b>Premier</b></font>)
never took upon himself the brunt of opposition oratory. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Premier</b></font>) said
in the House was generally short and pleasant,--with some slight,
drolling, undercurrent of uninjurious satire running through it. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Premier</b></font>) was a walking miracle of the wisdom of common sense. He (<font color='blue'><b>Premier</b></font>) never lost
his (<font color='blue'><b>Premier</b></font>) temper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Premier</b></font>) never made mistakes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Premier</b></font>) never grew either hot or cold
in a cause. He (<font color='blue'><b>Premier</b></font>) was never reckless in politics, and never cowardly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Premier</b></font>)
snubbed no man, and took snubbings from no man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a Knight of
the Garter, a Lord Lieutenant of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) county, and at sixty-two had
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) digestion unimpaired and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) estate in excellent order. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) was a
great buyer of pictures, which, perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) did not understand, and a
great collector of books which certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) never read. All the world
respected him (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) was a man to whom the respect of all the world
was as the breath of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) nostrils.

<p/>But even he (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) was not without his (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) peacock on the wall, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) skeleton
in the closet, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) thorn in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) side; though the peacock did not
scream loud, the skeleton was not very terrible in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) anatomical
arrangement, nor was the thorn likely to fester to a gangrene. The
Duke was always in awe about his (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) wife.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) was ever uneasy about his (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) wife, but it must not be supposed
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) feared the machinations of any Burgo Fitzgerald as being
destructive of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) domestic comfort. The Duchess was and always
had been all that is proper. Ladies in high rank, when gifted with
excelling beauty, have often been made the marks of undeserved
calumny;--but no breath of slander had ever touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) name. I doubt
if any man alive had ever had the courage even to wink at her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) since
the Duke had first called her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own. Nor was she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) a spendthrift, or
a gambler. She (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) was not fast in her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) tastes, or given to any pursuit
that was objectionable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) was simply a fool, and as a fool was ever
fearing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) was the mark of ridicule. In all such miseries she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>)
would complain sorrowfully, piteously, and occasionally very angrily,
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) dear Duke and protector; till sometimes her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) dear Duke did not
quite know what to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) or how to protect her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>). It did not suit
him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), a Knight of the Garter and a Duke of St. Bungay, to beg mercy
for that poor wife of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) from such a one as Mrs. Conway Sparkes; nor
would it be more in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) way to lodge a formal complaint against that
lady before his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) host or hostess,--as one boy at school may sometimes
do as regards another. <div class="bookquote">``If you don't like the people, my dear, we
will go away,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) late on that evening of which we have
spoken. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``I do not wish to go away. I have said
that we would stay till December, and Longroyston won't be ready
before that. But I think that something ought to be done to silence
that woman.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And the accent came strong upon <div class="bookquote">``something,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and then
again with terrific violence upon <div class="bookquote">``woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Duke</b></font>)</div><p/>The Duke did not know how to silence Mrs. Conway Sparkes. It was
a great principle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) life never to be angry with any one. How
could he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) get at Mrs. Conway Sparkes? <div class="bookquote">``I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is worth your
attention,''  (<font color='red'><b>the husband</b></font>)</div>said the husband. <div class="bookquote">``That's all very well, Duke,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wife</b></font>)</div>said the
wife, <div class="bookquote">``and perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is not. But I find her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in this house, and I
don't like to be laughed at. I think Lady Glencora should make her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
know her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Glencora is very young, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know about being so very young,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>said the Duchess, whose ear
had perhaps caught some little hint of poor Lady Glencora's almost
unintentional mimicry. Now as appeals of this kind were being made
frequently to the Duke, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was often driven to say some word,
of which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) himself hardly approved, to some one in protection of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
Duchess, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was aware that the matter was an annoyance, and at times
almost wished that her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) Grace was at--Longroyston.

<p/>And there was a third politician staying at Matching Priory who had
never yet risen to the rank of a statesman, but who had his (<font color='blue'><b>statesman</b></font>) hopes.
This was Mr. Bott, the member for St. Helens, whom Lady Glencora had
described as a man who stood about, with red hair,--and perhaps told
tales of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband. Mr. Bott was a person who certainly had
had some success in life and who had won it for himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) was not
very young, being at this time only just on the right side of fifty.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) was now enjoying his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) second session in Parliament, having been
returned as a pledged disciple of the Manchester school. Nor had he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>)
apparently been false to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) pledges. At St. Helens he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) was still held
to be a good man and true. But they who sat on the same side with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) in the House and watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) political manoeuvres, knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>)
was striving hard to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) finger into the public pie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) was not
a rich man, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) had made calico and had got into Parliament.
And though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) claimed to be a thoroughgoing Radical, he (<font color='blue'><b>Radical</b></font>) was a man
who liked to live with aristocrats, and was fond of listening to the
whispers of such as the Duke of St. Bungay or Mr. Palliser. It was
supposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) did understand something of finance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was at any
rate great in figures; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was possessed of much industry, and
was obedient withal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was a man who might make himself useful to a
Chancellor of the Exchequer ambitious of changes.

<p/>There are men who get into such houses as Matching Priory and whose
presence there is a mystery to many;--as to whom the ladies of the
house never quite understand why they are entertaining such a guest.
<div class="bookquote">``And Mr. Bott is coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>Mr. Palliser had said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Bott!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora had answered. <div class="bookquote">``Goodness me! who is Mr. Bott?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) is member for St. Helens,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser. <div class="bookquote">``A very serviceable
man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And what am I to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>asked Lady Glencora.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know that you can do anything with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a man who
has a great deal of business, and I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will spend most of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) time in the library.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>So Mr. Bott arrived. But though a huge
pile of letters and papers came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) every morning by post, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>)
unfortunately did not seem to spend much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) time in the library.
Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) had not found the clue to that lost apartment. Twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>)
went out shooting, but as on the first day he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) shot the keeper, and
on the second very nearly shot the Duke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) gave that up. Hunting he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>)
declined, though much pressed to make an essay in that art by Jeffrey
Palliser. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) seemed to spend his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) time, as Lady Glencora said, in
standing about,--except at certain times when he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was closeted with
Mr. Palliser, and when, it may be presumed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) made himself useful.
On such days he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would be seen at the hour of lunch with fingers
much stained with ink, and it was generally supposed that on those
occasions he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had been counting up taxes and calculating the effect
of great financial changes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was a tall, wiry, strong man, with a
bald head and bristly red beard, which, however, was cut off from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
upper and under lip. This was unfortunate, as had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hidden his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not have been in so marked a degree an ugly man. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) upper
lip was very long, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth was mean. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had found that
without the help of a razor to these parts he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not manage his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
soup to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) satisfaction, and preferring cleanliness to beauty had
shaved himself accordingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't dislike Mr. Bott so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
husband, <div class="bookquote">``if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) didn't rub his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) hands and smile so often, and seem
to be going to say something when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) really is not going to say
anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think you need trouble yourself about him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>), my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Palliser had answered.

<p/>``But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) looks at me in that way, I can't help stopping, as
I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) is going to speak; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) always says, <div class="bookquote">``Can I do
anything for you, Lady Glen-cowrer?'''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) instantly saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband did not like this. <div class="bookquote">``Don't be angry
with me, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You must admit that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) is rather a bore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not at all angry, Glencora,''  (<font color='red'><b>the husband</b></font>)</div>said the husband; <div class="bookquote">``and if you
insist upon it, I will see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) leaves;--and in such case will
of course never ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) again. But that might be prejudicial to me,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) is a man whom I trust in politics, and who may perhaps be
serviceable to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the husband</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course Lady Glencora declared that Mr. Bott might remain as long as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband desired, and of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) name no
more to Mr. Palliser; but from that time forth she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) regarded Mr. Bott as
an enemy, and felt also that Mr. Bott regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) in the same light.

<p/>When it was known among outside politicians that the Duke of St.
Bungay was staying at Matching Priory, outside politicians became
more sure than ever that Mr. Palliser would be the new Chancellor of
the Exchequer. The old minister and the young minister were of course
arranging matters together. But I doubt whether Mr. Palliser and the
Duke ever spoke on any such topic during the entire visit. Though
Mr. Bott was occasionally closeted with Mr. Palliser, the Duke never
troubled himself with such closetings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) went out shooting--on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>)
pony, read his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) newspaper, wrote his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) notes, and looked with the eye
of a connoisseur over all Mr. Palliser's farming apparatus. <div class="bookquote">``You seem
to have a good man, I should say,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duke</b></font>)</div>said the Duke. <div class="bookquote">``What! Hubbings?
Yes;--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a legacy from my uncle when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave me up the Priory.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A very good man, I should say. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't make it pay; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll make it look as though it did;--which is the next best thing.
I could never get rent out of land that I farmed myself,--never.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I
suppose not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser, who did not care much about it. The
Duke would have talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) by the hour together about farming had
Mr. Palliser been so minded; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) very little about
politics. Nor during the whole time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) stay at Matching did the
Duke make any other allusion to Mr. Palliser's hopes as regarded
the ministry, than that in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had told Lady Glencora at the
dinner-table that her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband's ambition was the highest by which
any man could be moved.

<p/>But Mr. Bott was sometimes honoured by a few words with the Duke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall muster pretty strong, your Grace,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bott had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>)
one day before dinner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends on how the changes go,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duke</b></font>)</div>said the Duke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose there will be a change?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes; there'll be a change,--certainly, I should say. And it will
be in your direction.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And in Palliser's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I should think so;--that is, if it suits him (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>). By-the-by, Mr.
Bott--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>Then there was a little whispered communication, in which
perhaps Mr. Bott was undertaking some commission of that nature which
Lady Glencora had called <div class="bookquote">``telling.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXV.

<p/>In Which Much of the History of the Pallisers Is Told.


<p/>At the end of ten days Alice found herself quite comfortable at
Matching Priory. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had now promised to remain there till the second
week of December, at which time she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was to go to Vavasor Hall,--there
to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father and Kate. The Pallisers were to pass their
Christmas with the Duke of Omnium in Barsetshire. <div class="bookquote">``We always are
to do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``It is the state occasion at Gatherum
Castle, but it only lasts for one week. Then we go somewhere else.
Oh dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you say `oh dear'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because--; I don't think I mean to tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'm sure I won't ask.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's so like you, Alice. But I can be as firm as you, and I'm sure
I won't tell you unless you do ask.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>But Alice did not ask, and it
was not long before Lady Glencora's firmness gave way.

<p/>But, as I have said, Alice had become quite comfortable at Matching
Priory. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was already growing upwards towards the light.
At any rate she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could listen with pleasure to the few words the Duke
would say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could even chat a little to the Duchess,--so
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) Grace had observed to Lady Glencora that <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin was a
very nice person,--a very nice person indeed. What a pity it was that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been so ill-treated by that gentleman in Oxfordshire!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady
Glencora had to explain that the gentleman lived in Cambridgeshire,
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), at any rate, had not treated anybody ill. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)--jilted him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>said the Duchess, almost whistling, and
opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) eyes very wide. <div class="bookquote">``Dear me, I'm sorry for that. I shouldn't
have thought it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) next spoke to Alice she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) assumed rather
a severe tone of emphasis;--but this was soon abandoned when Alice
listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) with complacency.

<p/>Alice also had learned to ride,--or rather had resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) riding,
which for years had been abandoned. Jeffrey Palliser had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
squire, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had become intimate with him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) so as to learn to
quarrel with him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) and to like him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>),--to such an extent that Lady
Glencora had laughingly told her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was going to do more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I rather think not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what has thinking to do with it? Who ever thinks about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't just at present,--at any rate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word it would be very nice;--and then perhaps some day you'd
be the Duchess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Glencora, don't talk such nonsense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Those are the speculations which people make. Only I should spite
you by killing myself, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might marry again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you say such horrid things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I shall,--some day. What right have I to stand in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) way?
He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) spoke to me the other day about Jeffrey's altered position, and I
knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) meant;--or rather what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) didn't mean to say, but what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) thought. But I shan't kill myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only know one other way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are thinking of things which should never be in your thoughts,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice vehemently. <div class="bookquote">``Have you no trust in God's providence? Cannot
you accept what has been done for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bott had gone away, much to Lady Glencora's delight, but had
unfortunately come back again. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) return Alice heard more of the
feud between the Duchess and Mrs. Conway Sparkes. <div class="bookquote">``I did not tell
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) friend;--<div class="bookquote">``I did not tell you before
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went that I was right about his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) tale-bearing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And did he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) bear tales?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I did get the scolding, and I know very well that it came
through him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), though Mr. Palliser did not say so. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) told me that
the Duchess had felt herself hurt by that other woman's way of
talking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it was not your fault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; that's what I said. It was he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) who desired me to ask Mrs. Conway
Sparkes to come here. I didn't want her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparkes</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparkes</b></font>) goes everywhere, and it
is thought a catch to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparkes</b></font>); but if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparkes</b></font>) had been drowned in the Red
Sea I shouldn't have minded. When I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said it was
nonsense,--which of course it was; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said I ought to make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparkes</b></font>) hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparkes</b></font>) tongue. Of course I said I couldn't. Mrs. Conway Sparkes
wouldn't care for me. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparkes</b></font>) quizzed me, myself, I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) that
I could take care of myself, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparkes</b></font>) were ten times Mrs. Conway
Sparkes, and had written finer poetry than Tennyson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is fine;--some of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I dare say! I know a great deal of it by heart, only I wouldn't
give her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparkes</b></font>) the pleasure of supposing that I had ever thought so much
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparkes</b></font>) poetry. And then I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tennyson</b></font>) that I couldn't take care of
the Duchess,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tennyson</b></font>) told me that I was a child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tennyson</b></font>) only meant that in love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a child; I know that. Why didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Tennyson</b></font>) marry some strong-minded,
ferocious woman that could keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Tennyson</b></font>) house in order, and frown Mrs.
Sparkes out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparkes</b></font>) impudence? It wasn't my fault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Tennyson</b></font>) that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``But I did. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tennyson</b></font>) kissed me, and said it was all right, and told me
that I should grow older. ``And Mrs. Sparkes will grow more impudent,<div class="bookquote">''
I said, `and the Duchess more silly.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparkes/Mrs. Conway Sparkes</b></font>)</div>And after that I went away. Now
this horrid Mr. Bott has come back again, and only that it would be
mean in me to condescend so far, I would punish him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) grins and
smiles at me, and rubs his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) big hands more than ever, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) feels
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) has behaved badly. Is it not horrid to have to live in the
house with such people?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think you need mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Tennyson</b></font>) much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but I am the mistress here, and am told that I am to entertain
the people. Fancy entertaining the Duchess of St. Bungay and Mr. Bott!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice had now become so intimate with Lady Glencora that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not
scruple to read her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wise lectures,--telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) allowed
herself to think too much of little things,--and too much also of
some big things. <div class="bookquote">``As regards Mr. Bott,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, <div class="bookquote">``I think you
should bear it as though there were no such person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that would be pretence,--especially to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; it would not be pretence; it would be the reticence which all
women should practise,--and you, in your position, more almost than
any other woman.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Then Lady Glencora pouted, told Alice that it was
a pity she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had not married Mr. Palliser, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>).

<p/>That evening,--the evening of Mr. Bott's return to Matching, that
gentleman found a place near to Alice in the drawing-room. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had
often come up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands together, and saying little
words, as though there was some reason from their positions that they
two should be friends. Alice had perceived this, and had endeavoured
with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) force to shake him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) off; but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a man, who if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
understood a hint, never took it. A cold shoulder was nothing to
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wanted to gain the person who showed it him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) code
of perseverance taught him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that it was a virtue to overcome cold
shoulders. The man or woman who received his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first overtures with
grace would probably be one on whom it would be better that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should
look down and waste no further time; whereas he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) or she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) who could
afford to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with disdain would no doubt be worth gaining.
Such men as Mr. Bott are ever gracious to cold shoulders. The colder
the shoulders, the more gracious are the Mr. Botts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a delightful person is our dear friend, Lady Glencora!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Bott, having caught Alice in a position from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not
readily escape.

<p/>Alice had half a mind to differ, or to make any remark that might
rid her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) from Mr. Bott. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not dare to say a word that might
seem to have been said playfully. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``How
very cold it is to-night!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was angry with herself for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own
stupidity as soon as the phrase was out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mouth, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
almost laughed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought of the Duchess and the hot-water pipes
at Longroyston.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is cold. You and her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) ladyship are great friends, I believe,
Miss Vavasor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) is my cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! yes; that is so pleasant. I have reason to know that Mr. Palliser
is very much gratified that you should be so much with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was unbearable. Alice could not quite assume sufficient courage
to get up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) chair and walk away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>), and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) must escape further conversation. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know that I am
very much with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), and if I were I can't think it would make any
difference to Mr. Palliser.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mr. Bott was not a man to be put down when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) had a purpose in
hand. <div class="bookquote">``I can assure you that those are his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) sentiments. Of course we
all know that dear Lady Glencora is young. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) is very young.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bott, I really would rather not talk about my cousin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, dear Miss Vavasor;--when we both have her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) welfare in view--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) welfare in view, Mr. Bott; not in the least. There is
no reason why I should. You must excuse me if I say I cannot talk
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) welfare with a perfect stranger.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did get up,
and went away from the Member of Parliament, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) rather
astonished at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) audacity. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) was a constant man, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) inner
resolve was simply to the effect that he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) would try it again.

<p/>I wonder whether Jeffrey Palliser did think much of the difference
between his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) present position and that which would have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had
Lady Glencora been the happy possessor of a cradle up-stairs with a
boy in it. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) must have done so. It is hardly possible that
any man should not be alive to the importance of such a chance. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
own present position was one of the most unfortunate which can fall
to the lot of a man. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, the Duke's youngest brother, had
left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) about six hundred a year, and had left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) also a taste
for living with people of six thousand. The propriety of earning
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bread had never been put before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father had been in
Parliament, and had been the most favoured son of the old Duke, who
for some years before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) death had never spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who now
reigned over the house of the Pallisers. Jeffrey's father had been
brought up at Matching Priory as scions of ducal houses are brought
up, and on the old man's death had been possessed of means sufficient
to go on in the same path, though with difficulty. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother had
done something for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and at various times he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had held some place
near the throne. But on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) death, when the property left behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was divided between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son and three daughters, Jeffrey Palliser
became possessed of the income above stated. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could live
on it,--and as during the winter months of the year a home was found
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) free of cost, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could keep hunters, and live as rich men
live. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was a poor, embarrassed man, without prospects,--until
this fine ducal prospect became opened to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the want of that
cradle at Matching Priory.

<p/>But the prospect was no doubt very distant. Lady Glencora might yet
have as many sons as Hecuba. Or she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) might die, and some other more
fortunate lady might become the mother of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cousin's heir. Or the
Duke might marry and have a son. And, moreover, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) cousin was only
one year older than himself, and the great prize, if it came his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) way,
might not come for forty years as yet. Nevertheless his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) hand might
now be acceptable in quarters where it would certainly be rejected
had Lady Glencora possessed that cradle up-stairs. We cannot but
suppose that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) must have made some calculations of this nature.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a pity you should do nothing all your life,''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) cousin
Plantagenet said to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) one morning just at this time. Jeffrey had
sought the interview in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) cousin's room, and I fear had done so
with some slight request for ready money.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Jeffrey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate you might marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes;--I could marry. There's no man so poor but what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can do
that. The question would be how I might like the subsequent
starvation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see that you need starve. Though your own fortune is small,
it is something,--and many girls have fortunes of their own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/>Jeffrey thought of Lady Glencora, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) made no allusion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) in
speech. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I'm very good at that kind of thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``When the father and mother came to ask of my house and my home I
should break down. I don't say it as praising myself;--indeed, quite
the reverse; but I fear I have not a mercenary tendency.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's nonsense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes; quite so. I admit that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Men must have mercenary tendencies or they would not have bread. The
man who ploughs that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may live does so because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), luckily, has a
mercenary tendency.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so. But you see I am less lucky than the ploughman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no vulgar error so vulgar,--that is to say, common or
erroneous, as that by which men have been taught to say that
mercenary tendencies are bad. A desire for wealth is the source
of all progress. Civilization comes from what men call greed. Let
your mercenary tendencies be combined with honesty and they cannot
take you astray.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Chancellor</b></font>)</div>This the future Chancellor of the Exchequer said
with much of that air and tone of wisdom which a Chancellor of the
Exchequer ought to possess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I haven't got any such tendencies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Jeffrey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you like to occupy a farm in Scotland?''  (<font color='red'><b>Plantagenet/Plantagenet Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Plantagenet
Palliser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And pay rent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would have to pay rent of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, no. It would be dishonest, as I know I should never pay
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are too old, I fear, for the public service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean a desk in the Treasury,--with a hundred a year. Yes; I
think I am too old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But have you no plan of your own?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much of one. Sometimes I have thought I would go to New
Zealand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would have to be a farmer there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--I shouldn't do that. I should get up an opposition to the
Government and that sort of thing, and then they would buy me off and
give me a place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That does very well here, Jeffrey, if a man can get into Parliament
and has capital enough to wait; but I don't think it would do out
there. Would you like to go into Parliament?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What; here? Of course I should. Only I should be sure to get
terribly into debt. I don't owe very much, now,--not to speak
of,--except what I owe you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You owe nothing to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Plantagenet/Plantagenet Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Plantagenet, with some little touch of
magniloquence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) tone. <div class="bookquote">``No; don't speak of it. I have no brother,
and between you and me it means nothing. You see, Jeffrey, it may
be that I shall have to look to you as my--my--my heir, in short.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hereupon Jeffrey</b></font>)</div>Hereupon Jeffrey muttered something as to the small probability of
such necessity, and as to the great remoteness of any result even if
it were so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all true,''  (<font color='red'><b>the heir</b></font>)</div>said the elder heir of the Pallisers, <div class="bookquote">``but
still--. In short, I wish you would do something. Do you think about
it; and then some day speak to me again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the heir</b></font>)</div><p/>Jeffrey, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) cousin with a cheque for #500 in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>)
waist-coat pocket, thought that the interview which had at one
time taken important dimensions, had not been concluded altogether
satisfactorily. A seat in Parliament! Yes, indeed! If his (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) cousin
would so far use his (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) political, monetary, or ducal interest as to
do that for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>);--as to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) something of the status properly
belonging to the younger son of the House, then indeed life would
have some charms for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)! But as for the farm in Scotland, or a desk
at an office in London,--his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own New Zealand plan would be better
than those. And then as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) went along of course he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) bethought himself
that it might be his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) lot yet to die, and at least to be buried, in
the purple, as a Duke of Omnium. If so, certainly it would be his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
duty to prepare another heir, and leave a duke behind him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>),--if it
were possible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to ride with us after lunch?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora to
him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) strolled into the drawing-room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Jeffrey; <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to study.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To do what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To study;--or rather I shall spend to-day in sitting down and
considering what I will study. My cousin has just been telling me
that I ought to do something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you ought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Iphigenia</b></font>)</div>said Iphigenia energetically from her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) writing-desk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) didn't seem to have any clear opinion what it ought to be.
You see there can't be two Chancellors of the Exchequer at the same
time. Mrs. Sparkes, what ought a young man like me to set about
doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go into Parliament, I should say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparkes/Mrs. Conway Sparkes</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparkes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes; exactly. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had some notion of that kind, too, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
didn't name any particular place. I think I'll try the City of
London. They've four there, and of course the chance of getting in
would thereby be doubled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought that commercial men were generally preferred in the City,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>said the Duchess, taking a strong and good-natured interest in the
matter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Palliser means to make a fortune in trade as a preliminary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparkes/Mrs. Conway Sparkes</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Sparkes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) meant anything of the kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>said the Duchess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate I have got to do something, so I can't go and ride,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Jeffrey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you ought to do something,''  (<font color='red'><b>Iphigenia</b></font>)</div>said Iphigenia from her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) desk.

<p/>Twice during this little conversation Lady Glencora had looked up,
catching Alice's eye, and Alice had well known what she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had meant.
<div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the glance had said, <div class="bookquote">``Plantagenet is beginning to take an
interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) cousin, and you know why. The man who is to be the
father of the future dukes must not be allowed to fritter away his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
time in obscurity. Had I that cradle up-stairs Jeffrey might be as
idle as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) pleased.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice understood it well.

<p/>Of course Jeffrey did join the riding party. <div class="bookquote">``What is a man like me
to do who wants to do something?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) said to Alice. Alice was quite
aware that Lady Glencora had contrived some little scheme that Mr.
Palliser should be riding next to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) liked Mr. Palliser, and
therefore had no objection; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) declared to herself that her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
cousin was a goose for her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) pains.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Sparkes says you ought to go into Parliament.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--and the dear Duchess would perhaps suggest a house in Belgrave
Square. I want to hear your advice now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can only say ditto to Miss Palliser.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! Iphy? About procrastination? But you see the more of my time
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) steals the better it is for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the evil you have got to cure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My cousin Plantagenet suggested--marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A very good thing too, I'm sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice; <div class="bookquote">``only it depends
something on the sort of wife you get.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean, of course, how much money she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Looking at it from my cousin's point of view, I suppose that it is
the only important point. Who are there coming up this year,--in the
way of heiresses?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word I don't know. In the first place, how much money makes
an heiress?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For such a fellow as me, I suppose ten thousand pounds ought to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, who had exactly that amount of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--; perhaps that's too moderate. But the lower one went in the
money speculation, the greater would be the number to choose from,
and the better the chance of getting something decent in the woman
herself. I have something of my own,--not much you know; so with
the lady's ten thousand pounds we might be able to live,--in some
second-rate French town perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't see what you would gain by that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My people here would have got rid of me. That seems to be the great
thing. If you hear of any girl with about that sum, moderately
good-looking, not too young so that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might know something of the
world, decently born, and able to read and write, perhaps you will
bear me in mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, who was quite aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had made an
accurate picture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own position. <div class="bookquote">``When I meet such a one, I will
send for you at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know no such person now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, no; not just at present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I declare I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could do anything better,''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin
said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that night. Lady Glencora was now in the habit of having
Alice with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) dressing-room every evening,
and then they would sit till the small hours came upon them. Mr.
Palliser always burnt the midnight oil and came to bed with the owls.
They would often talk of him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) prospects till Alice had perhaps
inspired his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife with more of interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) and them than she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
before felt. And Alice had managed generally to drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) friend away
from those topics which were so dangerous,--those allusions to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
childlessness, and those hints that Burgo Fitzgerald was still in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
thoughts. And sometimes, of course, they had spoken of Alice's own
prospects, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got into a way of telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin freely all
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt. On such occasions Lady Glencora would always tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had been right,--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) did not love the man. <div class="bookquote">``Though your
finger were put out for the ring,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora on one such
occasion, <div class="bookquote">``you should go back, if you did not love him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I did love him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I don't understand it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora; and, in truth,
close as was their intimacy, they did not perfectly understand each
other.

<p/>But on this occasion they were speaking of Jeffrey Palliser. <div class="bookquote">``I
declare I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could do any better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you talk such nonsense, I will not stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why should it be nonsense? You would be very comfortable with
your joint incomes. He (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is one of the best fellows in the world. It is
clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) likes you; and then we should be so near to each other.
I am sure Mr. Palliser would do something for him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) married,--and
especially if I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only know of two things against it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what are they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would not take me for his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife, and that I would not take
him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) for my husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? What do you dislike in him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) at all. I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) very much indeed. But one
can't marry all the people one likes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what reason is there why you shouldn't marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This chiefly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, after a pause; <div class="bookquote">``that I have just
separated myself from a man whom I certainly did love truly, and
that I cannot transfer my affections quite so quickly as that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>As soon as the words were out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mouth she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew that they should
not have been spoken. It was exactly what Glencora had done. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
had loved a man and had separated herself from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and had married
another all within a month or two. Lady Glencora first became red as
fire over her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) whole face and shoulders, and Alice afterwards did the
same as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked up, as though searching in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin's eyes for
pardon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is an unmaidenly thing to do, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora very
slowly, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) lowest voice. <div class="bookquote">``Nay, it is unwomanly; but one may
be driven. One may be so driven that all gentleness of womanhood is
driven out of one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Glencora!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not propose that you should do it as a sudden thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Glencora!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did do it suddenly. I know it. I did it like a beast that is
driven as its owner chooses. I know it. I was a beast. Oh, Alice, if
you know how I hate myself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I love you with all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``Glencora, I have
learned to love you so dearly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you are the only being that does. He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) can't love me. How is it
possible? You,--and perhaps another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are many who love you. He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) loves you. Mr. Palliser loves you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is impossible. I have never said a word to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) that could make
him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) love me. I have never done a thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) that can make him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) love
me. The mother of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) child he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) might have loved, because of that. Why
should he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) love me? We were told to marry each other and did it. When
could he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) have learned to love me? But, Alice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) requires no loving,
either to take it or to give it. I wish it were so with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice said what she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), but her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) words were but of
little avail as regarded those marriage sorrows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>at last Glencora said. <div class="bookquote">``What have I to forgive? You
don't suppose I do not know it all, and think of it all without the
chance of some stray word like that! Forgive you! I am so grateful
that you love me! Some one's love I must have found,--or I could not
have remained here.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXVI.

<p/>Lady Midlothian.


<p/>A week or ten days after this, Alice, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) came down to the
breakfast-parlour one morning, found herself alone with Mr. Bott. It
was the fashion at Matching Priory for people to assemble rather late
in the day. The nominal hour for breakfast was ten, and none of the
ladies of the party were ever seen before that. Some of the gentlemen
would breakfast earlier, especially on hunting mornings; and on some
occasions the ladies, when they came together, would find themselves
altogether deserted by their husbands and brothers. On this day it
was fated that Mr. Bott alone should represent the sterner sex, and
when Alice entered the room he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) was standing on the rug with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>)
back to the fire, waiting till the appearance of some other guest
should give him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) the sanction necessary for the commencement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>)
morning meal. Alice, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>), would have retreated had it
been possible, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had learned to dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) greatly, and was,
indeed, almost afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not do so without making
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) flight too conspicuous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you intend to prolong your stay here, Miss Vavasor?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Bott, taking advantage of the first moment at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked up
from a letter which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was reading.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For a few more days, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--I'm glad of that. Mr. Palliser has pressed me so much to remain
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) goes to the Duke's, that I cannot get away sooner. As I am an
unmarried man myself, I can employ my time as well in one place as in
another;--at this time of the year at least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must find that very convenient,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is convenient. You see in my position,--Parliamentary
position, I mean,--I am obliged, as a public man, to act in concert
with others. A public man can be of no service unless he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is prepared
to do that. We must give and take, you know, Miss Vavasor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>As Miss Vavasor made no remark in answer to this, Mr. Bott
continued--<div class="bookquote">``I always say to the men of my party,--of course I regard
myself as belonging to the extreme Radicals.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I came into Parliament on that understanding; and I have never
seen any occasion as yet to change any political opinion that I have
expressed. But I always say to the gentlemen with whom I act, that
nothing can be done if we don't give and take. I don't mind saying to
you, Miss Vavasor, that I look upon our friend, Mr. Palliser, as the
most rising public man in the country. I do, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am happy to hear you say so,''  (<font color='red'><b>victim</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) victim, who found herself
driven to make some remark.

<p/>``And I, as an extreme Radical, do not think I can serve my party
better than by keeping in the same boat with him (<font color='blue'><b>Radical</b></font>), as long as it will
hold the two. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Radical</b></font>)'ll make a Government hack of you,'' a friend of mine
said to me the other day. ``And I'll make a Manchester school Prime
Minister of him (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>),<div class="bookquote">'' I replied. I rather think I know what I'm about,
Miss Vavasor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so does he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>);--and so does he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>). Mr. Palliser is not the man to be
led by the nose by any one. But it's a fair system of give and take.
You can't get on in politics without it. What a charming woman is
your relative, Lady Glencowrer! I remember well what you said to me
the other evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I quite agree with you that confidential intercourse regarding
dear friends should not be lightly made.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But there are occasions, Miss Vavasor; there are occasions when the
ordinary laws by which we govern our social conduct must be made
somewhat elastic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think this one of them, Mr. Bott.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it not? Just listen to me for one moment, Miss Vavasor. Our
friend, Mr. Palliser, I am proud to say, relies much upon my humble
friendship. Our first connection has, of course, been political; but
it has extended beyond that, and has become pleasantly social;--I may
say, very pleasantly social.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a taste Mr. Palliser must have!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice thought to herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I need not tell you that Lady Glencowrer is--very young; we may
say, very young indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bott, I will not talk to you about Lady Glencora Palliser.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>This Alice said in a determined voice, and with all the power of
resistance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) command. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) frowned too, and looked savagely at Mr.
Bott. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) was a man of considerable courage, and knew how to bear
such opposition without flinching.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I tell you, Miss Vavasor, that I speak solely with a view to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) domestic happiness!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) wishes to have any such guardian of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) wishes it, Miss Vavasor! Now I have the means of knowing
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) has the greatest reliance on your judgement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hereupon Alice</b></font>)</div><p/>Hereupon Alice got up with the intention of leaving the room, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
was met at the door by Mrs. Conway Sparkes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you running from your breakfast, Miss Vavasor?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparkes</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Mrs. Sparkes; I am running from Mr. Bott,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, who was
almost beside herself with anger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bott, what is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparkes/Mrs. Conway Sparkes</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparkes. <div class="bookquote">``Ha, ha, ha,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>laughed Mr.
Bott.

<p/>Alice returned to the room, and Mrs. Sparkes immediately saw that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparkes</b></font>) had in truth been running from Mr. Bott. <div class="bookquote">``I hope I shall be able
to keep the peace,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparkes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I trust his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) offence was not one that
requires special punishment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha, ha, ha,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>again laughed Mr. Bott, who rather liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) position.

<p/>Alice was very angry with herself, feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had told more of
the truth to Mrs. Sparkes than she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparkes</b></font>) should have done, unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparkes</b></font>) was
prepared to tell the whole. As it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparkes</b></font>) wanted to say something,
and did not know what to say; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparkes</b></font>) confusion was at once stopped
by the entrance of Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Sparkes, good morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``I hope nobody has
waited breakfast. Good morning, Mr. Bott. Oh, Alice!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, going up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Alice, such a blow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>But Alice could see that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin was
not quite in earnest;--that the new trouble, though it might be
vexatious, was no great calamity. <div class="bookquote">``Come here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora;
and they both went into an embrasure of the window. <div class="bookquote">``Now I shall have
to put your confidence in me to the test. This letter is from,--whom
do you think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I guess?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From Lady Midlothian! and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)'s coming here on Monday, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) road
to London. Unless you tell me that you are quite sure this is as
unexpected by me as by you, I will never speak to you again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite sure of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! then we can consult. But first we'll go and have some
breakfast.''  (<font color='red'><b>ladies</b></font>)</div>Then more ladies swarmed into the room,--the Duchess and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) daughter, and the two Miss Pallisers, and others; and Mr. Bott
had his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) hands full in attending,--or rather in offering to attend, to
their little wants.

<p/>The morning was nearly gone before Alice and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin had any
further opportunity of discussing in private the approach of Lady
Midlothian; but Mr. Palliser had come in among them, and had been told
of the good thing which was in store for him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We shall be delighted
to see Lady Midlothian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But there is somebody here who will not be at all delighted to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there, indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Who is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) most undutiful cousin, Alice Vavasor. But, Alice, Mr. Palliser
knows nothing about it, and it is too long to explain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am extremely sorry--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>began Mr. Palliser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can assure you it does not signify in the least,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``It
will only be taking me away three days earlier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/>Upon hearing this Mr. Palliser looked very serious. What quarrel could
Miss Vavasor have had with Lady Midlothian which should make it
impossible for them to be visitors at the same house?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will do no such thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to say
that you are coward enough to run away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid, Miss Vavasor, that we can hardly bid her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) not come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Palliser. In answer to this, Alice protested that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would not
for worlds have been the means of keeping Lady Midlothian away from
Matching. <div class="bookquote">``I should tell you, Mr. Palliser, that I have never seen
Lady Midlothian, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is my far-away cousin. Nor have I ever
quarrelled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) has given me advice by letter, and I did
not answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) because I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had no business to interfere.
I shall go away, not because I am afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), but because, after
what has passed, our meeting would be unpleasant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) that Miss Vavasor is here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser.
<div class="bookquote">``And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) need not come unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) pleased.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>The matter was so managed at last that Alice found herself unable
to leave Matching without making more of Lady Midlothian's coming
than it was worth. It would undoubtedly be very disagreeable,--this
unexpected meeting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) relative; but, as Lady Glencora said,
Lady Midlothian would not eat her (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>). In truth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) felt ashamed of
herself in that she (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) was afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) relative. No doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) was
afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>). So much she (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) was forced to admit to herself. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>)
resolved at last that she (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) would not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) out of the
house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Mr. Bott an admirer of your cousin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparkes/Mrs. Conway Sparkes</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sparkes said that evening
to Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A very distant one I should think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Goodness gracious!''  (<font color='red'><b>an lady</b></font>)</div>exclaimed an old lady who had been rather awed
by Alice's intimacy and cousinship with Lady Glencora; <div class="bookquote">``it's the very
last thing I should have dreamt of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I didn't dream it, first or last,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparkes/Mrs. Conway Sparkes</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparkes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you ask?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't suppose that I am asking whether Miss Vavasor is an admirer
of his (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparkes/Mrs. Conway Sparkes</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparkes. <div class="bookquote">``I have no suspicion of that nature. I
rather think that when he (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) plays Bacchus she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) plays Ariadne, with full
intention of flying from him (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) in earnest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Mr. Bott inclined to play Bacchus?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>asked Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I rather thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) was this morning. If you observe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) has
something of a godlike and triumphant air about him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) godship will triumph there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I really think she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) would be throwing herself very much away,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said
the old lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Vavasor is not at all disposed to do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparkes/Mrs. Conway Sparkes</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparkes.
Then that conversation was allowed to drop.

<p/>On the following Monday, Lady Midlothian arrived. The carriage was
sent to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) at the station about three o'clock in the afternoon,
and Alice had to choose whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would undergo her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) first
introduction immediately on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) relative's arrival, or whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
would keep herself out of the way till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in the
drawing-room before dinner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) comes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, <div class="bookquote">``and of
course will tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) that you are here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that will be best; and--; dear me, I declare I don't know how
to manage it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) to you in my room if you like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; that would be too solemn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``That would make her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
understand that I thought a great deal about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we'll let things take their chance, and you shall come across
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) just as you would any other stranger.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Midlothian</b></font>)</div>It was settled at last
that this would be the better course, but that Lady Midlothian was to
be informed of Alice's presence at the Priory as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should
arrive.

<p/>Alice was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own room when the carriage in which sat the
unwelcome old lady was driven up to the hall-door. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heard the
wheels plainly, and knew well that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) enemy was within the house.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had striven hard all the morning to make herself feel indifferent
to this arrival, but had not succeeded; and was angry with herself
at finding that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sat up-stairs with an anxious heart, because
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cousin was in the room down-stairs. What was Lady
Midlothian to her (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) should be afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>)? And yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) was
very much afraid of Lady Midlothian. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) questioned herself on the
subject over and over again, and found herself bound to admit that
such was the fact. At last, about five o'clock, having reasoned much
with herself, and rebuked herself for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) own timidity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) descended
into the drawing-room,--Lady Glencora having promised that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would
at that hour be there,--and on opening the door became immediately
conscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was in the presence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) august relative. There
sat Lady Midlothian in a great chair opposite the fire, and Lady
Glencora sat near to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) on a stool. One of the Miss Pallisers was
reading in a further part of the room, and there was no one else
present in the chamber.

<p/>The Countess of Midlothian was a very little woman, between sixty and
seventy years of age, who must have been very pretty in her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) youth.
At present she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) made no pretension either to youth or beauty,--as
some ladies above sixty will still do,--but sat confessedly an old
woman in all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) external relations. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wore a round bonnet which
came much over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face,--being accustomed to continue the use
of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bonnet till dinner time when once she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been forced by
circumstances to put it on. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wore a short cloak which fitted
close to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) person, and, though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) occupied a great arm-chair,
sat perfectly upright, looking at the fire. Very small she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) carried in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grey eyes and sharp-cut features a certain look
of importance which saved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from being considered as small in
importance. Alice, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was a lady
over whom no easy victory could be obtained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, rising as her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) cousin entered the
room. <div class="bookquote">``Alice, let me introduce you to Lady Midlothian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) came forward, was able to assume an easy demeanour,
even though her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heart within was failing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand,
leaving it to the elder lady to speak the first words of greeting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad at last to be able to make your acquaintance, my dear,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Midlothian</b></font>)</div>said Lady Midlothian; <div class="bookquote">``very glad.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Midlothian</b></font>)</div>But still Alice did not speak.
<div class="bookquote">``Your aunt, Lady Macleod, is one of my oldest friends, and I have
heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) speak of you very often.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Lady Macleod has often spoken to me of your ladyship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said
Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we know each other's names,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div>said the Countess; <div class="bookquote">``and it will
be well that we should be acquainted with each other's persons. I am
becoming an old woman, and if I did not learn to know you now, or
very shortly, I might never do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice could not help thinking that even under those circumstances
neither might have had, so far as that was concerned, much cause of
sorrow, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not say so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was thinking altogether of Lady
Midlothian's letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>), and trying to calculate whether or no
it would be well for her (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) to rush away at once to the subject. That
Lady Midlothian would mention the letter, Alice felt well assured;
and when could it be better mentioned than now, in Glencora's
presence,--when no other person was near them to listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)? <div class="bookquote">``You
are very kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would wish to be so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>said Lady Midlothian. <div class="bookquote">``Blood is thicker
than water, my dear; and I know no earthly ties that can bind people
together if those of family connection will not do so. Your mother,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and I were young, was my dearest friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never knew my mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice,--feeling, however, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
spoke, that the strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) resistance to the old woman was
beginning to give way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear, you never did; and that is to my thinking another
reason why they who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should love you. But Lady Macleod is
your nearest relative,--on your mother's side, I mean,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) has
done her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) duty by you well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) has, Lady Midlothian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) has, and others, therefore, have been the less called upon to
interfere. I only say this, my dear, in my own vindication,--feeling,
perhaps, that my conduct needs some excuse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure Alice does not think that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is what I think rather than what Alice thinks that concerns my
own shortcomings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>said Lady Midlothian, with a smile which was
intended to be pleasant. <div class="bookquote">``But I have wished to make up for former
lost opportunities.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was about to refer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
letter, and trembled. <div class="bookquote">``I am very anxious now to be reckoned one of
Alice Vavasor's friends, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) will allow me to become so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can only be too proud,--if--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If what, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady. I believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) meant to be
gracious, but there was something in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) manner, or, perhaps, rather
in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) voice, so repellant, that Alice felt that they could hardly
become true friends. <div class="bookquote">``If what, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice means--''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>began Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let Alice say what she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) means herself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>said Lady Midlothian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hardly know how to say what I do mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, whose spirit
within her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was rising higher as the occasion for using it came upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am assured that you and I, Lady Midlothian, differ very much
as to a certain matter; and as it is one in which I must be guided by
my own opinion, and not that of any other person, perhaps--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean about Mr. Grey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice; <div class="bookquote">``I mean about Mr. Grey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so much about that matter, and your happiness as therein
concerned, that when I heard that you were here I was determined
to take Matching in my way to London, so that I might have an
opportunity of speaking to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you knew that Alice was here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I did. I suppose you have heard all the history,
Glencora?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Glencora was forced to acknowledge that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had heard the
history,--<div class="bookquote">``the history''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>being poor Alice's treatment of Mr. Grey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what do you think of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Both Alice and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hostess looked
round to the further end of the room in which Miss Palliser was
reading, intending thus to indicate that the lady knew as yet none
of the circumstances, and that there could be no good reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
should be instructed in them at this moment. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps another time
and another place may be better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Midlothian</b></font>)</div>said Lady Midlothian; <div class="bookquote">``but I must
go the day after to-morrow,--indeed, I thought of going to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Midlothian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Lady Midlothian!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must regard this as merely a passing visit, made upon business.
But, as I was saying, when shall I get an opportunity of speaking to
Alice where we need not be interrupted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Glencora suggested her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) room up-stairs, and offered the use of it
then, or on that night when the world should be about to go to bed.
But the idea of this premeditated lecture was terrible to Alice, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would not endure it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Midlothian, it would really be of no use.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of no use, my dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed. I did get your letter, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And as you have not answered it, I have come all this way to see
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be so sorry if I give offence, but it is a subject which
I cannot bring myself to discuss'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was going to say with a
stranger, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was able to check herself before the offensive word
was uttered,--<div class="bookquote">``which I cannot bring myself to discuss with any one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you don't mean to say that you won't see me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not talk upon that matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``I will not do it
even with Lady Macleod.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>said Lady Midlothian, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) sharp grey eyes now began to
kindle with anger; <div class="bookquote">``and therefore it is so very necessary that other
friends should interfere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I will endure no interference,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, <div class="bookquote">``either from persons
who are friends or who are not friends.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) spoke she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) rose
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">``You must forgive me, Lady Midlothian, if I say that
I can have no conversation with you on this matter.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) walked
out of the room, leaving the Countess and Lady Glencora together. As
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) went Miss Palliser lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) eyes from her (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) book, and knew that
there had been a quarrel, but I doubt if she (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had heard any of the
words which had been spoken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The most self-willed young woman I ever met in my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Midlothian</b></font>)</div>said Lady
Midlothian, as soon as Alice was gone.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``The most self-willed young woman I ever met in

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew very well how it would be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is quite frightful, my dear. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has been engaged, with the
consent of all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) friends, to this young man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know all about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must think she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is very wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't quite understand her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), but I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fears they would not
be happy together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Understand her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)! I should think not; nobody can understand her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). A

the world, as one may say;--to go to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) house, as I am told, and
talk to the servants, and give orders about the furniture and then
turn round and simply say that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has changed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hasn't
given the slightest reason to my knowledge.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>And Lady Midlothian, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) insisted on the absolute iniquity of Alice's proceedings, almost
startled Lady Glencora by the eagerness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) countenance. Lady
Midlothian had been one of those who, even now not quite two years
ago, had assisted in obtaining the submission of Lady Glencora
herself. Lady Midlothian seemed on the present occasion to remember
nothing of this, but Lady Glencora remembered it very exactly.
<div class="bookquote">``I shall not give it up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>continued Lady Midlothian. <div class="bookquote">``I have the
greatest possible objection to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father, who contrived to connect
himself with our family in a most shameful manner, without the

but I shall see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) now and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) my opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice held her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) ground, and avoided all further conversation with Lady
Midlothian. A message came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) through Lady Glencora imploring her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
to give way, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was quite firm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Midlothian</b></font>)</div>Lady Midlothian said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) went. <div class="bookquote">``Even yet
I hope that things may go right, and if so you will find that I can
forget and forgive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If perseverance merits success,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora to Alice, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
ought to succeed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) won't succeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.




<p/>CHAPTER XXVII.

<p/>The Priory Ruins.


<p/>Lady Midlothian went away on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) road to London on the Wednesday
morning, and Alice was to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) on the next day. It was now
December, and the weather was very clear and frosty, but at night
there was bright moonlight. On this special night the moon would be
full, and Lady Glencora had declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) and Alice would go out
amidst the ruins. It was no secret engagement, having been canvassed
in public, and having been met with considerable discouragement
by some of the party. Mr. Palliser had remarked that the night air
would be very cold, and Mr. Bott had suggested all manner of evil
consequences. Had Mr. Palliser alone objected, Lady Glencora might
have given way, but Mr. Bott's word riveted her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) purpose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are not going to be frightened,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``People do not generally walk out at night in December,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>Mr. Palliser
observed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just the reason why we want to do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.
<div class="bookquote">``But we shall wrap ourselves up, and nobody need be afraid. Jeffrey,
we shall expect you to stand sentinel at the old gate, and guard us
from the ghosts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/>Jeffrey Palliser, bargaining that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) might be allowed a cigar,
promised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was bidden.

<p/>The party at Matching Priory had by this time become very small.
There were indeed no guests left, not counting those of the Palliser
family, excepting Miss Vavasor, Mr. Bott, and an old lady who had
been a great friend of Mr. Palliser's mother. It was past ten in the
evening when Lady Glencora declared that the time had arrived for
them to carry out their purpose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) invited the two Miss Pallisers
to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), but they declined, urging their fear of the night air,
and showing by their manner that they thought the proposition a very
imprudent one. Mr. Bott offered to accompany them, but Lady Glencora
declined his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) attendance very stoutly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, Mr. Bott; you were one of those who preached a sermon
against my dissipation in the morning, and I'm not going to allow you
to join it, now the time for its enjoyment has come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Lady Glencora, if I were you, indeed I wouldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the
old lady, looking round towards Mr. Palliser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Mrs. Marsham, if you were me, indeed you would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>and Lady
Glencora also looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it a foolish thing to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser, sternly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you forbid it, of course we won't go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forbid it:--no; I shall not forbid it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Allons donc,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) and Alice were already muffled in cloaks and thick shawls, and
Alice now followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) out of the room. There was a door which opened
from the billiard-room out on to the grand terrace, which ran in
front of the house, and here they found Jeffrey Palliser already
armed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) cigar. Alice, to tell the truth, would much have
preferred to abandon the expedition, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had felt that it would
be cowardly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to desert Lady Glencora. There had not arisen any
very close intimacy between her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) and Mr. Palliser, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) entertained
a certain feeling that Mr. Palliser trusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), and liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) to
be with his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would have wished to justify this supposed
confidence, and was almost sure that Mr. Palliser expected her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) to
do so in this instance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) did say a word or two to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) cousin
up-stairs, urging that perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband would not like it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) say so plainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, <div class="bookquote">``and I'll give it
up instantly. But I'm not going to be lectured out of my purposes
secondhand by Mr. Bott or old Mother Marsham. I understand all these
people, my dear. And if you throw me over, Alice, I'll never forgive
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora added.

<p/>After this Alice resolved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would not throw her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) friend over.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was afraid to do so. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was also becoming a little afraid of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) friend,--afraid that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would be driven some day either to throw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) over, or to say words to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) that would be very unpalatable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Jeffrey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora as they walked abreast along the
broad terrace towards the ruins, <div class="bookquote">``when we get under the old gateway
you must let me and Alice go round the dormitory and the chapel
alone. Then we'll come back by the cloisters, and we'll take another
turn outside with you. The outside is the finest by this light,--only
I want to show Alice something by ourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not afraid, I know, and if Miss Vavasor is not--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Vavasor,--who, I think, would have allowed you to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) other name on such an occasion as this,--is never afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Glencora, how dare you say so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``I really think we had
better go back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt herself to be very angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) almost
began to fear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had mistaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and had thought better of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) than she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had deserved. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had now said struck Alice as
being vulgar,--as being premeditated vulgarity, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) annoyance
was excessive. Of course Mr. Palliser would think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was a
consenting party to the proposition made to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go back!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``No, indeed. We'll go on, and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
here. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) can call nobody anything. Don't be angry with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
said, as soon as they were out of hearing. <div class="bookquote">``The truth is this;--if
you choose to have him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) for your husband, you may.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if I do not choose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then there can be no harm done, and I will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) so. But,
Alice,--think of this. Whom will you meet that would suit you better?
And you need not decide now. You need not say a word, but leave me to
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), that if it is to be thought of at all, it cannot be thought
of till he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) meets you in London. Trust me, you will be safe with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall tell him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) nothing of the kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``I believe you
to be joking throughout, and I think the joke is a bad one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; there you wrong me. Indeed I am not joking. I know that in what
I am saying I am telling you the simple truth. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has said enough
to me to justify me in saying so. Alice, think of it all. It would
reconcile me to much, and it would be something to be the mother of
the future Duke of Omnium.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To me it would be nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice; <div class="bookquote">``less than nothing. I mean
to say that the temptation is one so easily resisted that it acts in
the other way. Don't say anything more about it, Glencora.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you don't wish it, I will not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--I do not wish it. I don't think I ever saw moonlight so bright
as this. Look at the lines of that window against the light. They are
clearer than you ever see them in the day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were now standing just within the gateway of the old cruciform
chapel, having entered the transept from a ruined passage which was
supposed to have connected the church with the dormitory. The church
was altogether roofless, but the entire walls were standing. The
small clerestory windows of the nave were perfect, and the large
windows of the two transepts and of the west end were nearly so. Of
the opposite window, which had formed the back of the choir, very
little remained. The top of it, with all its tracery, was gone, and
three broken upright mullions of uneven heights alone remained. This
was all that remained of the old window, but a transom or cross-bar
of stone had been added to protect the carved stone-work of the
sides, and save the form of the aperture from further ruin. That this
transom was modern was to be seen from the magnificent height and
light grace of the workmanship in the other windows, in which the
long slender mullions rose from the lower stage or foundation of the
whole up into the middle tracery of the arch without protection or
support, and then lost themselves among the curves, not running up
into the roof or soffit, and there holding on as though unable to
stand alone. Such weakness as that had not as yet shown itself in
English church architecture when Matching Priory was built.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it not beautiful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``I do love it so! And there is
a peculiar feeling of cold about the chill of the moon, different
from any other cold. It makes you wrap yourself up tight, but it does
not make your teeth chatter; and it seems to go into your senses
rather than into your bones. But I suppose that's nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
added, after a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not more so than what people are supposed to talk by moonlight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's unkind. I'd like what I say on such an occasion to be more
poetical or else more nonsensical than what other people say under
the same circumstances. And now I'll tell you why I always think of
you when I come here by moonlight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I suppose you don't often come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do; that is to say, I did come very often when we had the
full moon in August. The weather wasn't like this, and I used to run
out through the open windows and nobody knew where I was gone. I made
him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) come once, but he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) didn't seem to care about it. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) that
part of the refectory wall was falling; so he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked at that, and
had a mason sent the next day. If anything is out of order he (<font color='blue'><b>mason</b></font>) has
it put to rights at once. There would have been no ruins if all the
Pallisers had been like him (<font color='blue'><b>mason</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So much the better for the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--I say no. Things may live too long. But now I'm going to tell
you. Do you remember that night I brought you home from the play to
Queen Anne Street?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I do,--very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice had occasion to remember it, for it had been in the carriage on
that evening that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had positively refused to give any aid to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
cousin in that matter relating to Burgo Fitzgerald.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you remember how the moon shone then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know I do. As we came round the corner out of Cavendish Square he (<font color='blue'><b>mason</b></font>)
was standing there,--and a friend of yours was standing with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What friend of mine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind that; it does not matter now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean my cousin George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do mean your cousin; and oh, Alice! dear Alice! I don't know
why I should love you, for if you had not been hardhearted that
night,--stony cruel in your hard propriety, I should have gone with
him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) then, and all this icy coldness would have been prevented.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was standing quite close to Alice, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) spake she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) shook
with shivering and wrapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) furs closer and still closer about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``We had better go in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I am not cold,--not in that way. I won't go in yet. Jeffrey will
come to us directly. Yes;--we should have escaped that night if you
would have allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) to come into your house. Ah, well! we didn't,
and there's an end of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Glencora,--you cannot regret it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not regret it! Alice, where can your heart be? Or have you a heart?
Not regret it! I would give everything I have in the world to have
been true to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>). They told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) would spend my money. Though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) should have spent every farthing of it, I regret it; though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>)
should have made me a beggar, I regret it. They told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) would
ill-use me, and desert me,--perhaps beat me. I do not believe it; but
even though that should have been so, I regret it. It is better to
have a false husband than to be a false wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Glencora, do not speak like that. Do not try to make me think that
anything could tempt you to be false to your vows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tempt me to be false! Why, child, it has been all false throughout.
I never loved him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). How can you talk in that way, when you know that
I never loved him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)? They browbeat me and frightened me till I did as
I was told;--and now;--what am I now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) honest wife. Glencora, listen to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>And Alice took
hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``no; I am not honest. By law I am his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife; but the
laws are liars! I am not his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife. I will not say the thing that I
am. When I went to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) at the altar, I knew that I did not love the
man that was to be my husband. But him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),--Burgo,--I love him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) with all
my heart and soul. I could stoop at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) feet and clean his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shoes for
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and think it no disgrace!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Cora, my friend, do not say such words as those! Remember what
you owe your husband and yourself, and come away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do know what I owe him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and I will pay it him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). Alice, if I had a
child I think I would be true to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). Think! I know I would;--though
I had no hour of happiness left to me in my life. But what now is the
only honest thing that I can do? Why, leave him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>);--so leave him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) may have another wife and be the father of a child. What injury
shall I do him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) by leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) does not love me; you know yourself
that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) does not love me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice, that is untrue. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) does not; and you have seen clearly that
it is so. It may be that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) can love no woman. But another woman
would give him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) a son, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would be happy. I tell you that every
day and every night,--every hour of every day and of every night,--I
am thinking of the man I love. I have nothing else to think of. I
have no occupation,--no friends,--no one to whom I care to say a
word. But I am always talking to Burgo in my thoughts; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) listens
to me. I dream that his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) arm is round me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Glencora!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!--Do you begrudge me that I should tell you the truth? You have

after Christmas, we are to go to Monkshade, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) will be there.
Lady Monk is his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not go. No power should take you there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is easily said, child; but all the same I must go. I told Mr.
Palliser that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would be there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said it did not signify.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) actually said that it did not signify. I wonder whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
understands what it is for people to love each other;--whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) has
ever thought about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) plainly that you will not go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I did. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) plainly as words could tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). ``Glencora,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>)
said,--and you know the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) looks when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) means to be lord and
master, and put on the very husband indeed,--``This is an annoyance
which you must bear and overcome. It suits me that we should go to
Monkshade, and it does not suit me that there should be any one whom
you are afraid to meet.<div class="bookquote">'' Could I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would lose his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife
if I did go? Could I threaten him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that I would throw myself into
Burgo's arms if that opportunity were given to me? You are very wise,
and very prudent. What would you have had me say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would have you now tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) everything, rather than go to that
house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice, look here. I know what I am, and what I am like to become. I
loathe myself, and I loathe the thing that I am thinking of. I could
have clung to the outside of a man's body, to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very trappings,
and loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ten times better than myself!--ay, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had ill-treated me,--if I had been allowed to choose a husband for
myself. Burgo would have spent my money,--all that it would have been
possible for me to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>). But there would have been something
left, and I think that by that time I could have won even him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) to care
for me. But with that man--! Alice you are very wise. What am I to
do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice had no doubt as to what her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin should do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should be
true to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) marriage-vow, whether that vow when made were true or
false. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should be true to it as far as truth would now carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).
And in order that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might be true, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) husband as
much as might be necessary to induce him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) the threatened
visit to Monkshade. All that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to Lady Glencora, as they
walked slowly across the chapel. But Lady Glencora was more occupied
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) own thoughts than with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) friend's advice. <div class="bookquote">``Here's
Jeffrey!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What an unconscionable time we have kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't mention it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And I shouldn't have come to you now,
only that I thought I should find you both freezing into marble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are not such cold-blooded creatures as that,--are we, Alice?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``And now we'll go round the outside; only we must
not stay long, or we shall frighten those two delicious old duennas,
Mrs. Marsham and Mr. Bott.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>These last words were said as it were in a whisper to Alice; but they
were so whispered that there was no real attempt to keep them from
the ears of Mr. Jeffrey Palliser. Glencora, Alice thought, should not
have allowed the word duenna to have passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) lips in speaking to
any one; but, above all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should not have done so in the hearing
of Mr. Palliser's cousin.

<p/>They walked all round the ruin, on a raised gravel-path which had
been made there; and Alice, who could hardly bring herself to
speak,--so full was her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mind of that which had just been said to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),--was surprised to find that Glencora could go on, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) usual
light humour, chatting as though there were no weight within her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) to
depress her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) spirits.




<p/>CHAPTER XXVIII.

<p/>Alice Leaves the Priory.


<p/>As they came in at the billiard-room door, Mr. Palliser was there to
meet them. <div class="bookquote">``You must be very cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said to Glencora, who entered
first. <div class="bookquote">``No, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Glencora;--but her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) teeth were chattering,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) whole appearance gave the lie to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) words. <div class="bookquote">``Jeffrey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Palliser, turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) cousin, <div class="bookquote">``I am angry with you. You, at
least, should have known better than to have allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) to remain so
long.''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>Then Mr. Palliser turned away, and walked his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife off, taking
no notice whatsoever of Miss Vavasor.

<p/>Alice felt the slight, and understood it all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) plainly
enough, though not in words, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had trusted his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),
and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had betrayed the trust. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might have brought Glencora
in within five or six minutes, instead of allowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) to remain out
there in the freezing night air for nearly three-quarters of an hour.
That was the accusation which Mr. Palliser made against her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
made it with the utmost severity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) asked no question of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) whether
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) were cold. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) spoke no word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) even look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) might get herself away to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) bedroom as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) pleased. Alice
understood all this completely, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had not
deserved such severity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was not inclined to resent it. There was
so much in Mr. Palliser's position that was to be pitied, that Alice
could not find it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heart to be angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) is provoked with us, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Jeffrey Palliser, standing with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) for a moment in the billiard-room, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) a candle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) is afraid that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) will have caught cold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) thinks it wrong that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) should remain out at night so
long. You can easily understand, Miss Vavasor, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) has not much
sympathy for romance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) is right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, not exactly knowing what to
say, and not being able to forget what had been said about herself
and Jeffrey Palliser when they first left the house. <div class="bookquote">``Romance usually
means nonsense, I believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not Glencora's doctrine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) is younger than I am. My feet are very cold, Mr.
Palliser, and I think I will go up to my room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Jeffrey, offering her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``I think it so
hard that you should have incurred his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) displeasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will not hurt me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) does not forget.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Even that will not hurt me. Good night, Mr. Palliser.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As it is the last night, may I say good night, Alice? I shall be
away to-morrow before you are up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) still held her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand; but it had not been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) for half a minute,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had thought nothing of that, nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) draw it away even
now suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Glencora was very wrong there,--doing
an injury without meaning it to both of us. There can be no possible
reason why you should call me otherwise than is customary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can there never be a reason?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Mr. Palliser. Good night;--and if I am not to see you to-morrow
morning, good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will certainly not see me to-morrow morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye. Had it not been for this folly of Glencora's, our
acquaintance would have been very pleasant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To me it has been very pleasant. Good night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>), and went up alone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own room. Whether or no
other guests were still left in the drawing-room she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not know;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had seen that Mr. Palliser took his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife up-stairs, and
therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) considered herself right in presuming that the party
was broken up for the night. Mr. Palliser,--Plantagenet Palliser,
according to all rules of courtesy should have said a word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) went; but, as I have said before, Alice was disposed to overlook
his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) want of civility on this occasion. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went up alone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
room, and was very glad to find herself able to get close to a good
fire. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was, in truth, very cold--cold to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) bones, in spite of
what Lady Glencora had said on behalf of the moonlight. They two had
been standing all but still during the greater part of the time that
they had been talking, and Alice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat herself down, found that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) feet were numbed with the damp that had penetrated through her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
boots. Certainly Mr. Palliser had reason to be angry that his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife
should have remained out in the night air so long,--though perhaps
not with Alice.

<p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began to think of what had been told her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>); and to try
to think of what, under such circumstances, it behoved her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to do.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not doubt that Lady Glencora had intended to declare that,
if opportunity offered itself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband, and put
herself under the protection of Mr. Fitzgerald; and Alice, moreover,
had become painfully conscious that the poor deluded unreasoning
creature had taught herself to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might excuse herself
for this sin to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own conscience by the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was
childless, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might thus give to the man who had married
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) an opportunity of seeking another wife who might give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an
heir. Alice well knew how insufficient such an excuse would be even
to the wretched woman who had framed it for herself. But still
it would operate,--manifestly had already operated, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mind,
teaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to hope that good might come out of evil. Alice, who was
perfectly clearsighted as regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin, however much impaired
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) vision might have been with reference to herself, saw nothing but
absolute ruin, ruin of the worst and most intolerable description,
in the plan which Lady Glencora seemed to have formed. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) it was
black in the depths of hell; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) knew that to Glencora also it
was black. <div class="bookquote">``I loathe myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Glencora had said, <div class="bookquote">``and the thing that
I am thinking of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/>What was Alice to do under these circumstances? Mr. Palliser, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was
aware, had quarrelled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>); for in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) silent way he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had first
shown that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had trusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife's friend; and then, on this
evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had shown that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had ceased to trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cared
little for this. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wished to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
would listen, let his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) be what it might; and having
listened he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would surely act in some way that would serve to save
his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife. What Mr. Palliser might think of herself, Alice cared but
little.

<p/>But then there came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) an idea that was in every respect
feminine,--that in such a matter she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had no right to betray her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
friend. When one woman tells the story of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) love to another woman,
the confidant always feels that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) will be a traitor if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) reveals
the secret. Had Lady Glencora made Alice believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) meditated
murder, or robbery, Alice would have had no difficulty in telling the
tale, and thus preventing the crime. But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hesitated, feeling
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would disgrace herself by betraying her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) friend. And, after
all, was it not more than probable that Glencora had no intention of
carrying out a threat the very thought of which must be terrible to
herself?

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was thinking of all this, sitting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) dressing-gown close
over the fire, there came a loud knock at the door, which, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
had turned the key, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was forced to answer in person. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) opened
the door, and there was Iphigenia Palliser, Jeffrey's cousin, and Mr.
Palliser's cousin. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Vavasor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I know that I am taking
a great liberty, but may I come into your room for a few minutes? I
so much wish to speak to you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Alice of course bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) enter, and
placed a chair for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) by the fire.

<p/>Alice Vavasor had made very little intimacy with either of the two
Miss Pallisers. It had seemed to herself as though there had been two
parties in the house, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had belonged to the one which was
headed by the wife, whereas the Miss Pallisers had been naturally
attached to that of the husband. These ladies, as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had already
seen, almost idolized their cousin; and though Plantagenet Palliser
had till lately treated Alice with the greatest personal courtesy,
there had been no intimacy of friendship between them, and
consequently none between her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) special adherents. Nor was
either of these ladies prone to sudden friendship with such a one
as Alice Vavasor. A sudden friendship, with a snuffy president of a
foreign learned society, with some personally unknown lady employed
on female emigration, was very much in their way. But Alice had not
shown herself to be useful or learned, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) special intimacy with
Lady Glencora had marked her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) out as in some sort separated from them
and their ways.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that I am intruding,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Miss Palliser, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) were
almost afraid of Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``If I can do anything for you I shall be
very happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are going to-morrow, and if I did not speak to you now I should
have no other opportunity. Glencora seems to be very much attached to
you, and we all thought it so good a thing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) should have such
a friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you have not all changed your minds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, with a
faint smile, thinking as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) spoke that the <div class="bookquote">``all''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>must have been
specially intended to include the master of the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no;--by no means. I did not mean that. My cousin, Mr. Palliser,
I mean, liked you so much when you came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) does not like me quite so much now, because I went out in the
moonlight with his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife. Isn't that it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--no, Miss Vavasor. I had not intended to mention that at all.
I had not indeed. I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) certainly since you came in,--just
for a minute, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) is vexed. But it is not about that that I would
speak to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw plainly enough that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was angry with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) thought you would have brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) in earlier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) think that I can manage his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife? She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was
the mistress out there as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is in here. Mr. Palliser has been
unreasonable. Not that it signifies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) has been unreasonable; I don't, indeed, Miss
Vavasor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) has certainly been vexed. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) has much to vex
him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). You see, Glencora is very young.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bott also had declared that Lady Glencora was very young. It was
probable, therefore, that that special phrase had been used in some
discussion among Mr. Palliser's party as to Glencora's foibles. So
thought Alice as the remembrance of the word came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) is not younger than when Mr. Palliser married her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean that if a man marries a young wife he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) must put up with the
trouble. That is a matter of course. But their ages, in truth, are
very suitable. My cousin himself is not yet thirty. When I say that
Glencora is young--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) is younger in spirit, and perhaps in conduct, than
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had expected to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are not to suppose that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) complains, Miss Vavasor. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is
much too proud for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should hope so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, thinking of Mr. Bott.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hardly know how to explain to you what I wish to say, or how far
I may be justified in supposing that you will believe me to be acting
solely on Glencora's behalf. I think you have some influence with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>);--and I know no one else that has any.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My friendship with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) is not of very long date, Miss Palliser.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it, but still there is the fact. Am I not right in
supposing--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In supposing what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In supposing that you had heard the name of Mr. Fitzgerald as
connected with Glencora's before her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) marriage with my cousin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice paused a moment before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I had,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) then said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I think you were agreed, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) other relations, that such a
marriage would have been very dreadful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never spoke of the matter in the presence of any relatives of
Glencora's. You must understand, Miss Palliser, that though I am her (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
far-away cousin, I do not even know her (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) nearest connections. I never
saw Lady Midlothian till she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) came here the other day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) to abandon Mr. Fitzgerald.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was much with you, just at that time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I used to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then there was a pause, and Miss Palliser, in truth, scarcely knew
how to go on. There had been a hardness about Alice which her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) visitor
had not expected,--an unwillingness to speak or even to listen, which
made Miss Palliser almost wish that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) were out of the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had, however, mentioned Burgo Fitzgerald's name, and out of the room
now she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not go without explaining why she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had done so. But at
this point Alice came suddenly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) assistance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was often with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, continuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) reply;
<div class="bookquote">``and there was much talk between us about Mr. Fitzgerald. What was
my advice then can be of little matter; but in this we shall be both
agreed, Miss Palliser, that Glencora now should certainly not be
called upon to be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) has told you, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) has told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) is to be at Lady Monk's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) has told me that Mr. Palliser expects her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) at the
place to which they are going when they leave the Duke's, and that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) thinks it hard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) should be subjected to such a trial.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It should be no trial, Miss Vavasor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can it be otherwise? Come, Miss Palliser; if you are her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) friend,
be fair to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) friend;--but I am, above everything, my cousin's friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
has told me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) has complained of having to meet this man. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
declares that it should be nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>), and that the fear is an
idle folly. It should be nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>), but still the fear may not
be idle. Is there any reason,--any real reason,--why she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) should not
go? Miss Vavasor, I conjure you to tell me,--even though in doing so
you must cast so deep reproach upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) name! Anything will be better
than utter disgrace and sin!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I conceive that I cast no reproach upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) in saying that there is
great reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) should not go to Monkshade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think there is absolute grounds for interference? I must tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), you know, openly what he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would have to fear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think,--nay, Miss Palliser, I know,--that there is ample reason
why you should save her (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) from being taken to Monkshade, if you have
the power to do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can only do it, or attempt to do it, by telling him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) just what you
tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then tell him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). You must have thought of that, I suppose, before you
came to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--yes, Miss Vavasor. I had thought of it. No doubt I had thought
of it. But I had believed all through that you would assure me that
there was no danger. I believed that you would have said that she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) was
innocent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) is innocent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, rising from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) chair, as though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might thus give emphasis to words which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hardly dared to speak
above a whisper. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) is innocent. Who accuses her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) of guilt? You ask
me a question on his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) behalf--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On hers--and on his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), Miss Vavasor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A question which I feel myself bound to answer truly,--to answer
with reference to the welfare of them both; but I will not have it
said that I accuse her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) had been attached to Mr. Fitzgerald when
your cousin married her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) knew that this had been the case. She (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)
told him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) the whole truth. In a worldly point of view her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) marriage
with Mr. Fitzgerald would probably have been very imprudent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would have been utterly ruinous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps so; I say nothing about that. But as it turned out, she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) gave
up her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) own wishes and married your cousin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know about her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) own wishes, Miss Vavasor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is what she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) did. She (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) would have married Mr. Fitzgerald, had she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)
not been hindered by the advice of those around her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>). It cannot be
supposed that she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) has forgotten him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) in so short a time. There can be
no guilt in her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) remembrance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is guilt in loving any other than her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, Miss Palliser, it was her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) marriage that was guilty, and not
her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) love. But all that is done and past. It should be your cousin's
object to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) to forget Mr. Fitzgerald, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) will not do that
by taking her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) to a house where that gentleman is staying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) has said so much to you herself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know that I need declare to you what she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) has said herself.
You have asked me a question, and I have answered it, and I am
thankful to you for having asked it. What object can either of us
have but to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) position?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And to save him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) from dishonour. I had so hoped that this was simply
a childish dread on her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not so. It is no childish dread. If you have the power to
prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) going to Lady Monk's, I implore you to use it. Indeed, I
will ask you to promise me that you will do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``After what you have said, I have no alternative.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly. There is no alternative. Either for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sake or for hers,
there is none.''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>Thereupon Miss Palliser got up, and wishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) companion good
night, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) departure. Throughout the interview there had been
no cordiality of feeling between them. There was no pretence of
friendship, even as they were parting. They acknowledged that their
objects were different. That of Alice was to save Lady Glencora
from ruin. That of Miss Palliser was to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) cousin from
disgrace,--with perhaps some further honest desire to prevent sorrow
and sin. One loved Lady Glencora, and the other clearly did not love
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>). But, nevertheless, Alice felt that Miss Palliser, in coming to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), had acted well, and that to herself this coming had afforded
immense relief. Some step would now be taken to prevent that meeting
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had so deprecated, and it would be taken without any great
violation of confidence on her (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) part. She (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had said nothing as to which
Lady Glencora could feel herself aggrieved.

<p/>On the next morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was down in the breakfast-room soon after
nine, and had not been in the room many minutes before Mr. Palliser
entered. <div class="bookquote">``The carriage is ordered for you at a quarter before ten,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and I have come down to give you your breakfast.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>There was
a smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) spoke, and Alice could see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) intended
to make himself pleasant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you allow me to give you yours instead?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). But as it
happened, no giving on either side was needed, as Alice's breakfast
was brought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) separately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Glencora bids me say that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will be down immediately,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Palliser.

<p/>Alice then made some inquiry with reference to the effects of last
night's imprudence, which received only a half-pronounced reply.
Mr. Palliser was willing to be gracious, but did not intend to be
understood as having forgiven the offence. The Miss Pallisers then
came in together, and after them Mr. Bott, closely followed by Mrs.
Marsham, and all of them made inquiries after Lady Glencora, as
though it was to be supposed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) might probably be in a perilous
state after what she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had undergone on the previous evening. Mr. Bott
was particularly anxious. <div class="bookquote">``The frost was so uncommonly severe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that any delicate person like Lady Glencora must have suffered
in remaining out so long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The insinuation that Alice was not a delicate person and that, as
regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), the severity of the frost was of no moment, was very
open, and was duly appreciated. Mr. Bott was aware that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) great
patron had in some sort changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) opinion about Miss Vavasor, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) was of course disposed to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) own. A fortnight since Alice
might have been as delicate as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) pleased in Mr. Bott's estimation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you do not consider Lady Glencora delicate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice to Mr.
Palliser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) is not robust,''  (<font color='red'><b>the husband</b></font>)</div>said the husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By no means,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marsham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Marsham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bott.

<p/>Alice knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was being accused of being robust herself; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) bore it in silence. Ploughboys and milkmaids are robust, and the
accusation was a heavy one. Alice, however, thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would
not have minded it, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could have allowed herself to reply; but
this at the moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) going away she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) is as strong as the rest of us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Iphigenia</b></font>)</div>said Iphigenia
Palliser, who felt that after last night she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) owed something to Miss
Vavasor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As some of us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bott, determined to persevere in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>)
accusation.

<p/>At this moment Lady Glencora entered, and encountered the eager
inquiries of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) two duennas. These, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) quickly put aside,
and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) way up to Alice. <div class="bookquote">``The last morning has come, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Palliser must have thought that I was
never going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the other hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I have felt much obliged to you for
staying.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) said it coldly; and Alice began to wish that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
never seen Matching Priory.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Obliged!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``I can't tell you how much
obliged I am. Oh, Alice, I wish you were going to stay with us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are leaving this in a week's time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course we are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``With all my heart I wish we

town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will let me know when you come up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will send to you instantly; and, Alice, I will write to you from
Gatherum,--or from Monkshade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice could not help looking around and catching Miss Palliser's eye.
Miss Palliser was standing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) foot on the fender, but was so
placed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could see Alice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) made a slight sign with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
head, as much as to say that Lady Glencora must have no opportunity
of writing from the latter place; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said nothing.

<p/>Then the carriage was announced, and Mr. Palliser took Alice out on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) arm. <div class="bookquote">``Don't come to the door, Glencora,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I especially
wish you not to do so.''  (<font color='red'><b>The cousins</b></font>)</div>The two cousins then kissed each other, and
Alice went away to the carriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Miss Vavasor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) expressed no wish
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) might see her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) again as his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) guest at Matching Priory.

<p/>Alice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was driven in solitary grandeur to the railway station,
could not but wish that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had never gone there.




<p/>CHAPTER XXIX.

<p/>Burgo Fitzgerald.


<p/>On the night before Christmas Eve two men were sitting together in
George Vavasor's rooms in Cecil Street. It was past twelve o'clock,
and they were both smoking; there were square bottles on the table
containing spirits, with hot water and cold water in jugs, and one
of the two men was using, and had been using, these materials for
enjoyment. Vavasor had not been drinking, nor did it appear as though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) intended to begin. There was a little weak brandy and water in
a glass by his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) side, but there it had remained untouched for the
last twenty minutes. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) companion, however, had twice in that time
replenished his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) beaker, and was now puffing out the smoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) pipe
with the fury of a steamer's funnel when she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) has not yet burned the
black off her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) last instalment of fresh coals. This man was Burgo
Fitzgerald. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) was as handsome as ever;--a man whom neither man nor
woman could help regarding as a thing beautiful to behold;--but
not the less was there in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes and cheeks a look of haggard
dissipation,--of riotous living, which had become wearisome, by its
continuance, even to himself,--that told to all who saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) much
of the history of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life. Most men who drink at nights, and are
out till cockcrow doing deeds of darkness, become red in their
faces, have pimpled cheeks and watery eyes, and are bloated and not
comfortable to be seen. It is a kind dispensation of Providence who
thus affords to such sinners a visible sign, to be seen day by day,
of the injury which is being done. The first approach of a carbuncle
on the nose, about the age of thirty, has stopped many a man from
drinking. No one likes to have carbuncles on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose, or to appear
before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) female friends with eyes which look as though they were
swimming in grog. But to Burgo Fitzgerald Providence in her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) anger had
not afforded this protection. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) became at times pale, sallow, worn,
and haggard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) grew thin, and still thinner. At times he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had been
ill to death's door. Among his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) intimate friends there were those who
heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) declare frequently that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) liver had become useless to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>); and that, as for gastric juices, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had none left to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>). But
still his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) beauty remained. The perfect form of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) almost god-like
face was the same as ever, and the brightness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) bright blue eye
was never quenched.

<p/>On the present occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had come to Vavasor's room with the object
of asking from him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) certain assistance, and perhaps also some amount
of advice. But as regarded the latter article he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) was, I think, in the
state of most men when they seek for counsellors who shall counsel
them to do evil. Advice administered in accordance with his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) own views
would give him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) comfortable encouragement, but advice on the other
side he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) was prepared to disregard altogether. These two men had known
each other long, and a close intimacy had existed between them in the
days past, previous to Lady Glencora's engagement with Mr. Palliser.
When Lady Glencora endeavoured, vainly as we know, to obtain aid from
Alice Vavasor, Burgo had been instigated to believe that Alice's
cousin might assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>). Any such assistance George Vavasor would
have been quite ready to give. Some pecuniary assistance he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had
given, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) at that time having been in good funds. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had for
a moment induced Burgo to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) could obtain for the pair the
use of the house in Queen Anne Street as a point at which they might
meet, and from whence they might start on their journey of love. All
that was over. Those hopes had been frustrated, and Lady Glencora
M``Cluskie had become Lady Glencora Palliser and not Lady Glencora
Fitzgerald. But now other hopes had sprung up, and Burgo was again
looking to his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) friend for assistance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>Burgo said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) lifted the glass to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) mouth. <div class="bookquote">``It's a thing of that sort that a man can only
believe,--perhaps only hope,--till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has tried. I know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is
not happy with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and I have made up my mind that I will at least
ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) fortune all the same?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know how that would be. I haven't inquired, and I don't mean
to inquire. Of course I don't expect you or any one else to believe
me, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) money has no bearing on the question now. Heaven knows I
want money bad enough, but I wouldn't take away another man's wife
for money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean to say you think it would be wicked. I supposed you
to be above those prejudices.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all very well for you to chaff.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no chaff at all. I tell you fairly I wouldn't run away with any
man's wife. I have an old-fashioned idea that when a man has got a
wife he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to be allowed to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Public opinion, I know, is
against me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran away with my wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo, with emphasis;
<div class="bookquote">``that's the way I look at it. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was engaged to me first; and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
really loved me, while she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) never cared for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nevertheless, marriage is marriage, and the law is against you. But
if I did go in for such a troublesome job at all, I certainly should
keep an eye upon the money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It can make no difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It did make a difference, I suppose, when you first thought of
marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it did. My people brought us together because she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had a
large fortune and I had none. There's no doubt in the world about
that. And I'll tell you what; I believe that old harridan of an aunt
of mine is willing to do the same thing now again. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
doesn't say as much. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) wouldn't dare do that, but I do believe she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
means it. I wonder where she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) expects to go to!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's grateful on your part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my soul I hate her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). I do indeed. It isn't love for me now so
much as downright malice against Palliser, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) baulked her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
project before. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is a wicked old woman. Some of us fellows are
wicked enough--you and I for instance--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. I don't know, however, that I am qualified to run in a
curricle with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we are angels to such an old she-devil as that. You may believe
me or not, as you like.--I dare say you won't believe me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll say I do, at any rate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The truth is, I want to get her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), partly because I love her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>); but
chiefly because I do believe in my heart that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) loves me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) sake then! You are ready to sacrifice yourself to do
her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) a good turn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As for sacrificing myself, that's done. I'm a man utterly ruined
and would cut my throat to-morrow for the sake of my relations, if I
cared enough about them. I know my own condition pretty well. I have
made a shipwreck of everything, and have now only got to go down
among the breakers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only you would like to take Lady Glencora with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, by heavens! But sometimes, when I do think about it at
all,--which I do as seldom as I can,--it seems to me that I might
still become a different fellow if it were possible for me to marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had you married her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was free to marry any one and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
money was her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) own, it might have been so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it would be quite as much so now. I do, indeed. If I could
get her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) once, say to Italy, or perhaps to Greece, I think I could
treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) well, and live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) quietly. I know that I would try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Without the assistance of brandy and cigars.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And without any money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With only a little. I know you'll laugh at me; but I make pictures
to myself of a sort of life which I think would suit us, and be very
different from this hideous way of living, with which I have become
so sick that I loathe it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something like Juan and Haidée, with Planty Pall coming after you,
like old Lambro.''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>By the nickname of Planty Pall George Vavasor
intended to designate Lady Glencora's present husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Juan</b></font>)'d get a divorce, of course, and then we should be married. I
really don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Juan</b></font>)'d dislike it, when it was all done. They tell
me he (<font color='blue'><b>Juan</b></font>) doesn't care for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) since her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) marriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; twice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And have spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Once only,--so as to be able to do more than ask her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) were
well. Once, for about two minutes, I did speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what did she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said it would be better that we should not meet. When she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said
that, I knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was still fond of me. I could have fallen at
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) feet that moment, only the room was full of people. I do think
that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is fond of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Vavasor paused a few minutes. <div class="bookquote">``I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is fond of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
then said; <div class="bookquote">``but whether she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has pluck for such a thing as this, is
more than I can say. Probably she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has not. And if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has, probably
you would fail in carrying out your plan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must get a little money first,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And that's an operation which no doubt you find more difficult every
day, as you grow older.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to be much the same sort of thing. I went to Magruin this
morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)'s the fellow that lives out near Gray's Inn Lane?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just beyond the Foundling Hospital. I went to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was quite
civil about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) says I owe him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) over three thousand pounds, but
that doesn't seem to make any difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much did you ever have from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't recollect that I ever absolutely had any money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) got a
bill of mine from a tailor who went to smash, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) kept on renewing
that till it grew to be ever so many bills. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) did once let
me have twenty-four pounds,--but certainly never more than that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)'ll give you money now? I suppose you told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) why you
wanted it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't name her (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>),--but I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) what would make him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) understand
that I hoped to get off with a lady who had a lot of tin. I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
for two hundred and fifty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)'ll let me have one hundred and
fifty on a bill at two months for five hundred,--with your name to
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With my name to it! That's kind on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) part,--and on yours too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I can't take it up at the end of two months.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) won't come upon you then,--nor for a year or more afterwards.
I did pay you what you lent me before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you did. I always thought that to be a special compliment on
your part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you'll find I'll pull you through now in some way. If I don't
succeed in this I shall go off the hooks altogether soon; and if I
were dead my people would pay my debts then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Before the evening was over Vavasor promised the assistance asked
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was lending his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) name to a man who was
utterly ruined, and putting it into the hands of another man who was
absolutely without conscience in the use he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would make of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was creating for himself trouble, and in all probability
loss, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was ill able to bear. But the thing was one which came
within the pale of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laws. Such assistance as that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might ask of
others, and had asked and received before now. It was a reckless deed
on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) part, but then all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doings were reckless. It was consonant
with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mode of life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you would, old fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) got up to go
away. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, you know, I shall pull through in this; and perhaps,
after all, some part of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) fortune will come with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). If so you'll
be all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I may. But look here, Burgo,--don't you give that fellow up
the bill till you've got the money into your fist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may be quite easy about that. I know their tricks. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) and I will
go to the bank together, and we shall squabble there at the door
about four or five odd sovereigns,--and at last I shall have to give
him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) up two or three. Beastly old robber! I declare I think he (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>)'s worse
than I am myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>Then Burgo Fitzgerald took a little more brandy
and water and went away.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) was living at this time in the house of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) relatives in
Cavendish Square, north of Oxford Street. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) uncles and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) aunts,
and all those who were his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) natural friends, had clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) with a
tenacity that was surprising; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had never been true to any of
them, and did not even pretend to like them. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) father, with whom
for many years he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had not been on speaking terms, was now dead; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had sisters whose husbands would still open their houses to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>),
either in London or in the country;--would open their houses to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>),
and lend him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) their horses, and provide him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) with every luxury which
the rich enjoy,--except ready money. When the uttermost stress of
pecuniary embarrassment would come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>), they would pay something
to stave off the immediate evil. And so Burgo went on. Nobody now
thought of saying much to reproach him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>). It was known to be waste of
words, and trouble in vain. They were still fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
was beautiful and never vain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) beauty;--because in the midst
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) recklessness there was always about him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) a certain kindliness
which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) pleasant to those around him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was soft and gracious
with children, and would be very courteous to his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) lady cousins. They
knew that as a man he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was worthless, but nevertheless they loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>).
I think the secret of it was chiefly in this,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) seemed to
think so little of himself.

<p/>But now as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) walked home in the middle of the night from Cecil
Street to Cavendish Square he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) did think much of himself. Indeed such
self-thoughts come naturally to all men, be their outward conduct
ever so reckless. Every man to himself is the centre of the whole
world;--the axle on which it all turns. All knowledge is but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
perception of the things around him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). All love, and care for others,
and solicitude for the world's welfare, are but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own feelings as
to the world's wants and the world's merits.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had played his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) part as a centre of all things very badly. Of that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very well aware. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had sense enough to know that it should be
a man's lot to earn his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bread after some fashion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) often told
himself that never as yet had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) earned so much as a penny roll. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had learned to comprehend that the world's progress depends on the
way in which men do their duty by each other,--that the progress
of one generation depends on the discharge of such duties by that
which preceded it;--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) generation, had done
nothing to promote such progress. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoroughly despised himself,--if
there might be any good in that! But on such occasions as these, when
the wine he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had drunk was sufficient only to drive away from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the
numbness of despair, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was all alone with the cold night air
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, when the stars were bright above him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and the world
around him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was almost quiet, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would still ask himself whether
there might not yet be, even for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), some hope of a redemption,
--some chance of a better life in store for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was still
young,--wanting some years of thirty. Could there be, even for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
some mode of extrication from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) misery?

<p/>We know what was the mode which now, at this moment, was suggesting
itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was proposing to himself, as the best thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
could do, to take away another man's wife and make himself happy with
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)! What he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had said to Vavasor as to disregarding Lady Glencora's
money had been perfectly true. That in the event of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) going off
with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), some portion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) enormous wealth would still cling to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did believe. Seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had no children he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not
understand where else it should all go. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought of this
as it regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), not as it regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had before
made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>),--a suit which was then honourable, however
disadvantageous it might have seemed to be to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had made in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
mind certain calculations as to the good things which would result
to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were successful He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would keep hounds, and have three or
four horses every day for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own riding, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have no more
interviews with Magruin, waiting in that rogue's dingy back parlour
for many a weary wretched half-hour, till the rogue should be pleased
to show himself. So far he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) had been mercenary; but he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) had learned to
love the girl, and to care more for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) than for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) money, and when
the day of disappointment came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>),--the day on which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had
told him (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) that all between them was to be over for ever,--he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) had, for
a few hours, felt the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) love more than the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>)
money.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) had had no further hope. No such idea as that which now
filled his (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) mind had then come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>). The girl had gone from him (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>)
and married another man, and there was an end of it. But by degrees
tidings had reached him (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not happy,--reaching him (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) through
the mouths of people who were glad to exaggerate all that they had
heard. A whole tribe of his (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) female relatives had been anxious to
promote his (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) marriage with Lady Glencora M``Cluskie, declaring that,
after all that was come and gone, Burgo would come forth from his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
troubles as a man of great wealth. So great was the wealth of the
heiress that it might withstand even his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) propensities for spending.
That whole tribe had been bitterly disappointed; and when they heard
that Mr. Palliser's marriage had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) no child, and that Lady
Glencora was unhappy,--they made their remarks in triumph rather
than in sorrow. I will not say that they looked forward approvingly
to such a step as that which Burgo now wished to take,--though as
regarded his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) aunt, Lady Monk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) himself had accused her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>); but they
whispered that such things had been done and must be expected, when
marriages were made up as had been that marriage between Mr. Palliser
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) bride.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) walked on, thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) project, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) strove hard to cheat
himself into a belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would do a good thing in carrying Lady
Glencora away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband. Bad as had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had
never before done aught so bad as that. The more fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) intention
became, the more thoroughly he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) came to perceive how great and
grievous was the crime which he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) contemplated. To elope with another
man's wife no longer appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) to be a joke at which such men
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) might smile. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) tried to think that in this case there
would be special circumstances which would almost justify him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), and
also her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). They had loved each other and had sworn to love each other
with constancy. There had been no change in the feelings or even in
the wishes of either of them. But cold people had come between them
with cold calculations, and had separated them. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) told
himself, made to marry a man she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did not love. If they two loved
each other truly, would it not still be better that they should come
together? Would not the sin be forgiven on account of the injustice
which had been done to them? Had Mr. Palliser a right to expect more
from a wife who had been made to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) without loving him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)? Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) reverted to those dreams of a life of love, in some sunny country,
of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had spoken to Vavasor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) strove to nourish them.
Vavasor had laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), talking of Juan and Haidée. But Vavasor,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Juan</b></font>) said to himself, was a hard cold man, who had no touch of romance
in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) character. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not be laughed out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plan by such as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--nor would he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be frightened by the threat of any Lambro who might
come after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might come in the guise of indignant uncle
or injured husband.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had crossed from Regent Street through Hanover Square, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
came out by the iron gates into Oxford Street, a poor wretched girl,
lightly clad in thin raiment, into whose bones the sharp freezing air
was penetrating, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for money. Would he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) something to
get drink, so that for a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might feel the warmth of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life
renewed? Such midnight petitions were common enough in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ears, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was passing on without thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was urgent, and
took hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``For love of God,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if it's only a penny
to get a glass of gin! Feel my hand,--how cold it is.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) strove
to put it up against his (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) face.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) looked round at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was very young,--sixteen,
perhaps, at the most, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had once,--nay very lately,--been
exquisitely pretty. There still lingered about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes some remains
of that look of perfect innocency and pure faith which had been hers
not more than twelve months since. And now, at midnight, in the
middle of the streets, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was praying for a pennyworth of gin, as
the only comfort she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew, or could expect!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are cold!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>), trying to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cheerily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cold!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), repeating the word, and striving to wrap herself
closer in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rags, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shivered--<div class="bookquote">``Oh God! if you knew what it
was to be as cold as I am! I have nothing in the world,--not one
penny,--not a hole to lie in!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are alike then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo, with a slight low laugh. <div class="bookquote">``I also
have nothing. You cannot be poorer than I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You poor!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Gracious; how beautiful you are! Such as you are never poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) laughed again,--in a different tone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) always laughed when any
one told him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) beauty. <div class="bookquote">``I am a deal poorer than you, my girl,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You have nothing. I have thirty thousand pounds worse than
nothing. But come along, and I will get you something to eat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), eagerly. Then looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) again, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
exclaimed--<div class="bookquote">``Oh, you are so handsome!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to a public-house and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bread and meat and beer,
and stood by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ate it. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was shy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) then, and
would fain have taken it to a corner by herself, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) perceived this, and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) back to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), but still spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
a word or two as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ate. The woman at the bar who served him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) looked
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) wonderingly, staring into his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) face; and the pot-boy woke
himself thoroughly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) might look at Burgo; and the waterman from
the cab-stand stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>); and women who came in for gin looked
almost lovingly up into his (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>) regarded them all not at all,
showing no feeling of disgrace at his (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>) position, and no desire to
carry himself as a ruffler. He (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>) quietly paid what was due when the
girl had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) meal, and then walked with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) out of the
shop. <div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``what must I do with you? If I give you a
shilling can you get a bed?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could get a bed
for sixpence. <div class="bookquote">``Then keep the other sixpence for your breakfast,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But you must promise me that you will buy no gin to-night.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
promised him (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>) hand as he (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>) wished her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) good
night;--his (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>) hand, which it had been the dearest wish of Lady Glencora
to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) took it and pressed it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I
might once see you again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``because you are so good and so
beautiful.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>) laughed again cheerily, and walked on, crossing the
street towards Cavendish Square. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) stood looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>) was
out of sight, and then as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) moved away,--let us hope to the bed
which his (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>) bounty had provided, and not to a gin-shop,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) exclaimed
to herself again and again--<div class="bookquote">``Gracious, how beautiful he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s
a good un,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the woman at the public-house had said as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>)
left it; <div class="bookquote">``but, my! did you ever see a man's face handsome as that
fellow's?''


 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: Burgo Fitzgerald.-RSB-


<p/>Poor Burgo! All who had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) since life had begun with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) and striven to cherish him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>). And with it all, to what a
state had he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) come! Poor Burgo! had his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) eyes been less brightly blue,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) face less godlike in form, it may be that things would
have gone better with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>). A sweeter-tempered man than he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) never
lived,--nor one who was of a kinder nature. At this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had
barely money about him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) aunt's house at
Monkshade, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had promised to be there before Christmas Day,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) was bound to start on the next morning, before help from Mr.
Magruin was possible. Nevertheless, out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Magruin</b></font>) very narrow funds he (<font color='blue'><b>Magruin</b></font>)
had given half a crown to comfort the poor creature who had spoken to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Magruin</b></font>) in the street.




<p/>CHAPTER XXX.

<p/>Containing a Love Letter.


<p/>Vavasor, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Magruin</b></font>) sat alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Magruin</b></font>) room, after Fitzgerald had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>),
began to think of the days in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had before wished to assist
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) friend in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) views with reference to Lady Glencora;--or rather
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) began to think of Alice's behaviour then, and of Alice's words.
Alice had steadfastly refused to give any aid. No less likely
assistant for such a purpose could have been selected. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
been very earnest in declaring that it was Glencora's duty to stand
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) promise to Burgo. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is a desperate spendthrift,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>Kate
Vavasor had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Then let her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) teach him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to be otherwise,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice had answered. <div class="bookquote">``That might have been a good reason for refusing
his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) offer when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) first made it; but it can be no excuse for untruth,
now that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has told him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) loves him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If a woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
said again, <div class="bookquote">``won't venture her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) fortune for the man she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) loves, her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
love is not worth having.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>All this George Vavasor remembered now;
and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) remembered it he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) asked himself whether the woman that had
once loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would venture her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fortune for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) still.

<p/>Though his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) sister had pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) on the subject with all the
vehemence that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could use, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had hardly hitherto made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) really desired to marry Alice. There had grown upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) lately certain Bohemian propensities,--a love of absolute
independence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) thoughts as well as actions,--which were
antagonistic to marriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was almost inclined to think that
marriage was an old-fashioned custom, fitted indeed well enough for
the usual dull life of the world at large,--as many men both in
heathen and in Christian ages have taught themselves to think of
religion,--but which was not adapted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) advanced intelligence.
If he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) loved any woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) cousin Alice. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) thoroughly
respected any woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) respected her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). But that idea of tying himself
down to a household was in itself distasteful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It is a thing
terrible to think of,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) once said to a congenial friend in these
days of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) life, <div class="bookquote">``that a man should give permission to a priest
to tie him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to another human being like a Siamese twin, so that all
power of separate and solitary action should be taken from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for
ever! The beasts of the field do not treat each other so badly. They
neither drink themselves drunk, nor eat themselves stupid;--nor do
they bind themselves together in a union which both would have to
hate.''  (<font color='red'><b>a friend</b></font>)</div>In this way George Vavasor, trying to imitate the wisdom of
the brutes, had taught himself some theories of a peculiar nature.
But, nevertheless, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) thought of Alice Vavasor on this occasion,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) began to feel that if a Siamese twin were necessary for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
of all others was the woman to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would wish to be so bound.

<p/>And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) did it at all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) must do it now. Under the joint
instigation of himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) sister,--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) thought, and perhaps
not altogether without reason,--she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had broken her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) engagement with Mr.
Grey. That she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would renew it again if left to herself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) believed
probable. And then, despite that advanced intelligence which had
taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) to regard all forms and ceremonies with the eye of a
philosopher, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had still enough of human frailty about him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) to feel
keenly alive to the pleasure of taking from John Grey the prize which
John Grey had so nearly taken from him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). If Alice could have been
taught to think as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) did as to the absurdity of those indissoluble
ties, that would have been better. But nothing would have been more
impossible than the teaching of such a lesson to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) cousin Alice.
George Vavasor was a man of courage, and dared do most things;--but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would not have dared to commence the teaching of such a lesson to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).

<p/>And now, at this moment, what was his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) outlook into life generally? He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
had very high ambition, and a fair hope of gratifying it if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) could
only provide that things should go well with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) for a year or so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
was still a poor man, having been once nearly a rich man; but still
so much of the result of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nearly acquired riches remained to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
that on the strength of them he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might probably find his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way into
Parliament. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had paid the cost of the last attempt, and might,
in a great degree, carry on this present attempt on credit. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
succeeded there would be open to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a mode of life, agreeable in
itself, and honourable among men. But how was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to bear the cost
of this for the next year, or the next two years? His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grandfather
was still alive, and would probably live over that period. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
married Alice he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would do so with no idea of cheating her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
money. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should learn,--nay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had already learned from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
lips,--how perilous was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enterprise. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to be a woman
who would boldly risk all in money, though no consideration would
induce her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to stir a hair's breadth towards danger in reputation.
Towards teaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that doctrine at which I have hinted, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
not have dared to make an attempt; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have no
repugnance to telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted to spend all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) money in
the first year or two of their married life!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was still in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm-chair, thinking of all this, with that small
untasted modicum of brandy and water beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard some
distant Lambeth clock strike three from over the river. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rose
from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seat, and taking the candles in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, sat himself down
at a writing-desk on the other side of the room. <div class="bookquote">``I needn't send it
when it's written,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``and the chances are that I
won't.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paper, and wrote as follows:--


<p/>DEAR ALICE,

<p/>The time was when the privilege was mine of beginning my
letters to you with a warmer show of love than the above
word contains,--when I might and did call you dearest; but
I lost that privilege through my own folly, and since that
it has been accorded to another. But you have found,--with
a thorough honesty of purpose than which I know nothing
greater,--that it has behoved you to withdraw that
privilege also. I need hardly say that I should not have
written as I now write, had you not found it expedient to
do as you have done. I now once again ask you to be my
wife. In spite of all that passed in those old days,--of
all the selfish folly of which I was then guilty, I think
you know, and at the time knew, that I ever loved you.
I claim to say for myself that my love to you was true
from first to last, and I claim from you belief for that
statement. Indeed I do not think that you ever doubted my
love.

<p/>Nevertheless, when you told me that I might no longer hope
to make you my wife, I had no word of remonstrance that
I could utter. You acted as any woman would act whom love
had not made a fool. Then came the episode of Mr. Grey;
and bitter as have been my feelings whilst that engagement
lasted, I never made any attempt to come between you and
the life you had chosen. In saying this I do not forget
the words which I spoke last summer at Basle, when, as
far as I knew, you still intended that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) should be your
husband. But what I said then was nothing to that which,
with much violence, I refrained from saying. Whether you
remember those few words I cannot tell; but certainly
you would not have remembered them,--would not even have
noticed them,--had your heart been at Nethercoats.

<p/>But all this is nothing. You are now again a free woman;
and once again I ask you to be my wife. We are both older
than we were when we loved before, and will both be prone
to think of marriage in a somewhat different light. Then
personal love for each other was most in our thoughts. God
forbid that it should not be much in our thoughts now!
Perhaps I am deceiving myself in saying that it is not
even now stronger in mine than any other consideration.
But we have both reached that time of life, when it is
probable that in any proposition of marriage we should
think more of our adaptability to each other than we
did before. For myself I know that there is much in my
character and disposition to make me unfit to marry a
woman of the common stamp. You know my mode of life,
and what are my hopes and my chances of success. I run
great risk of failing. It may be that I shall encounter
ruin where I look for reputation and a career of honour.
The chances are perhaps more in favour of ruin than of
success. But, whatever may be the chances, I shall go on
as long as any means of carrying on the fight are at my
disposal. If you were my wife to-morrow I should expect to
use your money, if it were needed, in struggling to obtain
a seat in Parliament and a hearing there. I will hardly
stoop to tell you that I do not ask you to be my wife for
the sake of this aid;--but if you were to become my wife
I should expect all your cooperation;--with your money,
possibly, but certainly with your warmest spirit.

<p/>And now, once again, Alice,--dearest Alice, will you
be my wife? I have been punished, and I have kissed the
rod,--as I never kissed any other rod. You cannot accuse
my love. Since the time in which I might sit with my arm
round your waist, I have sat with it round no other waist.
Since your lips were mine, no other lips have been dear
to me. Since you were my counsellor, I have had no other
counsellor,--unless it be poor Kate, whose wish that we
may at length be married is second in earnestness only
to my own. Nor do I think you will doubt my repentance.
Such repentance indeed claims no merit, as it has been
the natural result of the loss which I have suffered.
Providence has hitherto been very good to me in not having
made that loss irremediable by your marriage with Mr. Grey.
I wish you now to consider the matter well, and to tell me
whether you can pardon me and still love me. Do I flatter
myself when I feel that I doubt your pardon almost more
than I doubt your love?

<p/>Think of this thing in all its bearings before you answer
me. I am so anxious that you should think of it that I
will not expect your reply till this day week. It can
hardly be your desire to go through life unmarried. I
should say that it must be essential to your ambition that
you should join your lot to that of some man the nature
of whose aspirations would be like to your own. It is
because this was not so as regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whose suit you had
accepted, that you found yourself at last obliged to part
from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). May I not say that with us there would be no
such difference? It is because I believe that in this
respect we are fitted for each other, as man and woman
seldom are fitted, that I once again ask you to be my
wife.

<p/>This will reach you at Vavasor, where you will now be with
the old squire and Kate. I have told her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) nothing of my
purpose in writing this letter. If it should be that your
answer is such as I desire, I should use the opportunity
of our re-engagement to endeavour to be reconciled to my
grandfather. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) has misunderstood me and has ill-used me.
But I am ready to forgive that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) will allow me to
do so. In such case you and Kate would arrange that, and
I would, if possible, go down to Vavasor while you are
there. But I am galloping on a-head foolishly in thinking
of this, and am counting up my wealth while the crockery
in my basket is so very fragile. One word from you will
decide whether or no I shall ever bring it into market.

<p/>If that word is to be adverse do not say anything
of a meeting between me and the Squire. Under such
circumstances it would be impossible. But, oh, Alice! do
not let it be adverse. I think you love me. Your woman's
pride towards me has been great and good and womanly; but
it has had its way; and, if you love me, might now be
taught to succumb.

<p/>Dear Alice, will you be my wife?

<p/>Yours, in any event, most affectionately,

<p/>GEORGE VAVASOR.


<p/>Vavasor, when he (<font color='blue'><b>VAVASOR</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>VAVASOR</b></font>) letter, went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>VAVASOR</b></font>) seat over
the fire, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>VAVASOR</b></font>) sat with it close at his (<font color='blue'><b>VAVASOR</b></font>) hand for nearly an
hour. Once or twice he (<font color='blue'><b>VAVASOR</b></font>) took it up with fingers almost itching to
throw it into the fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>VAVASOR</b></font>) took it up and held the corners between
his (<font color='blue'><b>VAVASOR</b></font>) forefinger and thumb, throwing forward his (<font color='blue'><b>VAVASOR</b></font>) hand towards the
flame, as though willing that the letter should escape from him (<font color='blue'><b>VAVASOR</b></font>) and
perish if chance should so decide. But chance did not so decide, and
the letter was put back upon the table at his (<font color='blue'><b>VAVASOR</b></font>) elbow. Then when the
hour was nearly over he (<font color='blue'><b>VAVASOR</b></font>) read it again. <div class="bookquote">``I'll bet two to one that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
gives way,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>VAVASOR</b></font>) said to himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>VAVASOR</b></font>) put the sheet of paper back
into the envelope. <div class="bookquote">``Women are such out-and-out fools.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>VAVASOR</b></font>) took
his (<font color='blue'><b>VAVASOR</b></font>) candle, and carrying his (<font color='blue'><b>VAVASOR</b></font>) letter with him (<font color='blue'><b>VAVASOR</b></font>), went into his (<font color='blue'><b>VAVASOR</b></font>) bedroom.

<p/>The next morning was the morning of Christmas Eve. At about nine
o'clock a boy came into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) room who was accustomed to call for
orders for the day. <div class="bookquote">``Jem,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said to the boy, <div class="bookquote">``there's half a crown
lying there on the looking-glass.''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>Jem looked and acknowledged the
presence of the half-crown. <div class="bookquote">``Is it a head or a tail, Jem?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>asked
the boy's master. Jem scrutinized the coin, and declared that the
uppermost surface showed a tail. <div class="bookquote">``Then take that letter and post it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George Vavasor. Whereupon Jem, asking no question and thinking
but little of the circumstances under which the command was given,
did take the letter and did post it. In due accordance with postal
regulations it reached Vavasor Hall and was delivered to Alice on the
Christmas morning.

<p/>A merry Christmas did not fall to the lot of George Vavasor on the
present occasion. An early Christmas-box he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) did receive in the shape
of a very hurried note from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) friend Burgo. <div class="bookquote">``This will be brought
to you by Stickling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stickling</b></font>)</div>the note said; but who Stickling was Vavasor
did not know. <div class="bookquote">``I send the bill. Couldn't you get the money and send
it me, as I don't want to go up to town again before the thing comes
off? You're a trump; and will do the best you can. Don't let that
rogue off for less than a hundred and twenty.--Yours, B. F.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Magruin/Magruin</b></font>)</div>Vavasor,
therefore, having nothing better to do, spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) Christmas morning
in calling on Mr. Magruin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Vavasor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Magruin/Magruin</b></font>)</div>said Magruin; <div class="bookquote">``really this is no morning for
business!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Magruin/Magruin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Time and tide wait for no man, Mr. Magruin, and my friend wants his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
money to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Vavasor,--to-morrow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, to-morrow. If time and tide won't wait, neither will love.
Come, Mr. Magruin, out with your cheque-book, and don't let's have any
nonsense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But is the lady sure, Mr. Vavasor?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Magruin/Magruin</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Magruin, anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ladies never are sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor; <div class="bookquote">``hardly more sure than bills
made over to money-lenders. I'm not going to wait here all day. Are
you going to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) the money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Christmas-day, Mr. Vavasor! There's no getting money in the city
to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>But Vavasor before he (<font color='blue'><b>Magruin</b></font>) left did get the money from Mr. Magruin,--#122
10s.--for which an acceptance at two months for #500 was given
in exchange,--and carried it off in triumph. <div class="bookquote">``Do tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) to be
punctual,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Magruin/Magruin</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Magruin, when Vavasor took his (<font color='blue'><b>Magruin</b></font>) leave. <div class="bookquote">``I do so
like young men to be punctual. But I really think Mr. Fitzgerald is
the most unpunctual young man I ever did know yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George Vavasor, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) went away.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) ate his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) Christmas dinner in absolute solitude at an eating-house
near his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) lodgings. It may be supposed that no man dares to dine at
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) club on a Christmas Day. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at any rate did not so dare;--and
after dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wandered about through the streets, wondering within
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would endure the restraints of married life. And the
same dull monotony of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) days was continued for a week, during which
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waited, not impatiently, for an answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) letter. And before
the end of the week the answer came.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXI.

<p/>Among the Fells.


<p/>Alice came down to breakfast on that Christmas morning at Vavasor
Hall without making any sign as to the letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had received. The
party there consisted of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) grandfather, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin
Kate, and herself. They all made their Christmas salutations as is
usual, and Alice received and made hers as did the others, without
showing that anything had occurred to disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tranquillity. Kate
remarked that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had heard that morning from Aunt Greenow, and
promised to show Alice the letter after breakfast. But Alice said no
word of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't your aunt come here to eat her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) Christmas dinner?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said
the Squire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, sir, because you didn't ask her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, standing close
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) grandfather,--for the old man was somewhat deaf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why didn't you ask her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>);--that is, if she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) stands upon asking to
come to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) old home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, sir, but I couldn't do that without your bidding. We Vavasors
are not always fond of meeting each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold your tongue, Kate. I know what you mean, and you should be the
last to speak of it. Alice, my dear, come and sit next to me. I am
much obliged to you for coming down all this way to see your old
grandfather at Christmas. I am indeed. I only wish you had brought
better news about your sweetheart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>)'ll think better of it before long, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa, you shouldn't say that. You would not wish me to marry against
my own judgement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know much about ladies' judgements,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man. <div class="bookquote">``It
does seem to me that when a lady makes a promise she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ought to keep
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``According to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, <div class="bookquote">``if I were engaged to a man, and
found that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a murderer, I still ought to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Mr. Grey is not a murderer,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray,--pray, don't talk about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``If you do I really
cannot sit and hear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have given over saying anything on the subject,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Vavasor/Mr. John Vavasor/Mr. Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said John
Vavasor, speaking as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had already expended upon it a vast
amount of paternal eloquence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had, however, never said more than
has been recorded in these pages. Alice during this conversation, sat
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin's letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) pocket, and as yet had not even begun
to think what should be the nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) reply.

<p/>The Squire of Vavasor Hall was a stout old man, with a red face and
grey eyes, which looked fiercely at you, and with long grey hair, and
a rough grey beard, which gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) something of the appearance of an
old lion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was passionate, unreasoning, and specially impatient
of all opposition; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was affectionate, prone to forgive when
asked to do so, unselfish, and hospitable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was, moreover, guided
strictly by rules, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) believed to be rules of right. His (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
grandson George had offended him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) very deeply,--had offended him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
and never asked his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pardon. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was determined that such pardon
should never be given, unless it were asked for with almost bended
knees; but, nevertheless, this grandson should be his (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) heir. That
was his (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) present intention. The right of primogeniture could not, in
accordance with his (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) theory, be abrogated by the fact that it was, in
George Vavasor's case, protected by no law. The Squire could leave
Vavasor Hall to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) pleased, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) could not have hoped to rest
quietly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) grave should it be found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had left it to any
one but the eldest son of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) own eldest son. Though violent, and
even stern, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was more prone to love than to anger; and though none
of those around him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) dared to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) grandson, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
longed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) heart for some opportunity of being reconciled to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>).

<p/>The whole party went to church on this Christmas morning. The small
parish church of Vavasor, an unpretending wooden structure, with a
single bell which might be heard tinkling for a mile or two over
the fells, stood all alone about half a mile from the Squire's gate.
Vavasor was a parish situated on the intermediate ground between
the mountains of the lake country and the plains. Its land was
unproductive, ill-drained, and poor, and yet it possessed little or
none of the beauty which tourists go to see. It was all amidst the
fells, and very dreary. There were long skirtings of dark pines
around a portion of the Squire's property, and at the back of the
house there was a thick wood of firs running up to the top of what
was there called the Beacon Hill. Through this there was a wild steep
walk which came out upon the moorland, and from thence there was a
track across the mountain to Hawes Water and Naddale, and on over
many miles to the further beauties of Bowness and Windermere. They
who knew the country, and whose legs were of use to them, could find
some of the grandest scenery in England within reach of a walk from
Vavasor Hall; but to others the place was very desolate. For myself,
I can find I know not what of charm in wandering over open, unadorned
moorland. It must be more in the softness of the grass to the feet,
and the freshness of the air to the lungs, than in anything that
meets the eye. You might walk for miles and miles to the north-east,
or east, or south-east of Vavasor without meeting any object to
arrest the view. The great road from Lancaster to Carlisle crossed
the outskirts of the small parish about a mile from the church, and
beyond that the fell seemed to be interminable. Towards the north
it rose, and towards the south it fell, and it rose and fell very
gradually. Here and there some slight appearance of a valley might
be traced which had been formed by the action of the waters; but
such breakings of ground were inconsiderable, and did not suffice to
interrupt the stern sameness of the everlasting moorland.

<p/>The daily life at Vavasor was melancholy enough for such a one as the
Squire's son, who regarded London as the only place on the earth's
surface in which a man could live with comfort. The moors offered
no charms to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) much appreciate the homely comforts of
the Hall; for the house, though warm, was old-fashioned and small,
and the Squire's cook was nearly as old as the Squire himself. John
Vavasor's visits to Vavasor were always visits of duty rather than of
pleasure. But it was not so with Alice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could be very happy there
with Kate; for, like herself, Kate was a good walker and loved the
mountains. Their regard for each other had grown and become strong
because they had gone together o'er river and moor, and because they
had together disregarded those impediments of mud and wet which
frighten so many girls away from the beauties of nature.

<p/>On this Christmas Day they all went to church, the Squire being
accompanied by Alice in a vehicle which in Ireland is called an
inside jaunting-car, and which is perhaps the most uncomfortable kind
of vehicle yet invented; while John Vavasor walked with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) niece.
But the girls had arranged that immediately after church they would
start for a walk up the Beacon Hill, across the fells, towards Hawes
Water. They always dined at the Hall at the vexatious hour of five;
but as their church service, with the sacrament included, would
be completed soon after twelve, and as lunch was a meal which the
Squire did not himself attend, they could have full four hours for
their excursion. This had all been planned before Alice received her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
letter; but there was nothing in that to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) change her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mind
about the walk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) when they were together in
the jaunting-car, <div class="bookquote">``you ought to get married.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>The Squire was hard
of hearing, and under any circumstances an inside jaunting-car is a
bad place for conversation, as your teeth are nearly shaken out of
your head by every movement which the horse makes. Alice therefore
said nothing, but smiled faintly, in reply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) grandfather. On
returning from church he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) insisted that Alice should again accompany
him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>), telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) specially that he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) desired to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``My dear
child,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I have been thinking a great deal about you, and
you ought to get married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, perhaps I shall some day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if you quarrel with all your suitors,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man. <div class="bookquote">``You
quarrelled with your cousin George, and now you have quarrelled with
Mr. Grey. You'll never get married, my dear, if you go on in that
way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I be married more than Kate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Kate! I don't know that anybody wants to marry Kate. I wish
you'd think of what I say. If you don't get married before long,
perhaps you'll never get married at all. Gentlemen won't stand that
kind of thing for ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girls</b></font>)</div><p/>The two girls took a slice of cake each in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand, and started on
their walk. <div class="bookquote">``We shan't be able to get to the lake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice; <div class="bookquote">``but we can go as far as the big stone on Swindale
Fell, where we can sit down and see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember the last time we sat there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate. <div class="bookquote">``It is
nearly three years ago, and it was then that you told me that all was
to be over between you and George. Do you remember what a fool I was,
and how I screamed in my sorrow? I sometimes wonder at myself and my
own folly. How is it that I can never get up any interest about my
own belongings? And then we got soaking wet through coming home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember that very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how dark it was! That was in September, but we had dined early.
If we go as far as Swindale we shall have it very dark coming home
to-day;--but I don't mind that through the Beacon Wood, because I
know my way so well. You won't be afraid of half an hour's dark?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I do remember that day. Well; it's all for the best, I suppose.
And now I must read you my aunt's letter.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>Then, while they were
still in the wood, Kate took out the letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt and read
it, while they still walked slowly up the hill. It seemed that
hitherto neither of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) two suitors had brought the widow to terms.
Indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) continued to write of Mr. Cheesacre as though that
gentleman were inconsolable for the loss of Kate, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) niece
much serious advice as to the expedience of returning to Norfolk,
in order that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) might secure so eligible a husband. <div class="bookquote">``You must
understand all the time, Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, pausing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) read the
letter, <div class="bookquote">``that the dear man has never given me the slightest ground
for the faintest hope, and that I know to a certainty that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) makes
an offer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) twice a week,--that is, on every market day. You
can't enjoy half the joke if you won't bear that in mind.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Alice
promised that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would bear it all in mind, and then Kate went on
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) reading. Poor Bellfield was working very hard at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) drill,
Mrs. Greenow went on to say; so hard that sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) really thought
the fatigue would be too much for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) strength. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would come in
sometimes of an evening and just take a cup of tea;--generally on
Mondays and Thursdays. <div class="bookquote">``These are not market days at Norwich,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said
Kate; <div class="bookquote">``and thus unpleasant meetings are avoided.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comes in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Greenow, <div class="bookquote">``and takes a little tea; and sometimes I think that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will faint at my feet.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kneels there on every occasion,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, <div class="bookquote">``and repeats his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) offer also twice a week, I have not the
least doubt in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And will she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) accept him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at last?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really I don't know what to think of it. Sometimes I fancy that
she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likes the fun of the thing, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is too wide-awake to
put herself in any man's power. I have no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lends him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money,
because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants it sadly and she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is very generous. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gives him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
money, I feel sure, but takes his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) receipt on stamped paper for every
shilling. That's her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) character all over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the writer</b></font>)</div><p/>The letter then went on to say that the writer had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mind
to remain at Norwich certainly through the winter and spring, and
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was anxiously desirous that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) dear Kate should go back to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Come and have one other look at Oileymead,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the letter,
<div class="bookquote">``and then, if you make up your mind that you don't like it or him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I
won't ask you to think of them ever again. I believe him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be a very
honest fellow.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did you ever know such a woman?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate; <div class="bookquote">``with
all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) faults I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would go through fire and water to serve
me. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d lend me money without any stamped paper.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>Then Aunt
Greenow's letter was put up, and the two girls had come out upon the
open fell.

<p/>It was a delicious afternoon for a winter's walk. The air was clear
and cold, but not actually frosty. The ground beneath their feet
was dry, and the sky, though not bright, had that appearance of
enduring weather which gives no foreboding of rain. There is a
special winter's light, which is very clear though devoid of all
brilliancy,--through which every object strikes upon the eye with
well-marked lines, and under which almost all forms of nature seem
graceful to the sight if not actually beautiful. But there is a
certain melancholy which ever accompanies it. It is the light of
the afternoon, and gives token of the speedy coming of the early
twilight. It tells of the shortness of the day, and contains even in
its clearness a promise of the gloom of night. It is absolute light,
but it seems to contain the darkness which is to follow it. I do not
know that it is ever to be seen and felt so plainly as on the wide
moorland, where the eye stretches away over miles, and sees at the
world's end the faint low lines of distant clouds settling themselves
upon the horizon. Such was the light of this Christmas afternoon, and
both the girls had felt the effects of it before they reached the big
stone on Swindale Fell, from which they intended to look down upon
the loveliness of Hawes Water. As they went up through the wood there
had been some laughter between them over Aunt Greenow's letter; and
they had discussed almost with mirth the merits of Oileymead and
Mr. Cheesacre; but as they got further on to the fell, and as the
half-melancholy wildness of the place struck them, their words became
less light, and after a while they almost ceased to speak.

<p/>Alice had still her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) pocket. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had placed it there
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) came down to breakfast, and had carried it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) since.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had come to no resolution as yet as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) answer to it, nor had
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) resolved whether or no she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would show it to Kate. Kate had ever
been regarded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) steadfast friend. In all these affairs
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had spoken openly to Kate. We know that Kate had in part betrayed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), but Alice suspected no such treason. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had often quarrelled
with Kate; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had quarrelled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) not on account of any sin
against the faith of their friendship. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) believed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cousin
perfectly, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) found herself often called upon to disagree
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) almost violently. Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) not show this letter to
Kate, and discuss it in all its bearings before she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) replied to it?
This was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mind as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) walked silently along over the fell.

<p/>The reader will surmise from this that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was already half inclined
to give way, and to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) lot to that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cousin George. Alas,
yes! The reader will be right in his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) surmise. And yet it was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
love for the man that prompted her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) to run so terrible a risk. Had
it been so, I think that it would be easier to forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was
beginning to think that love,--the love of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had once thought
so much,--did not matter. Of what use was it, and to what had it led?
What had love done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) friend Glencora? What had love done for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)? Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) not loved John Grey, and had she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) not felt that with
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) love life with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would have been distasteful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)? It
would have been impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) to marry a man whom personally she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
disliked; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cousin George,--well enough, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said
to herself almost indifferently.

<p/>Upon the whole it was a grievous task to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) in these days,--this
having to do something with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) life. Was it not all vain and futile?
As for that girl's dream of the joys of love which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had once
dreamed,--that had gone from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) slumbers, never to return. How might
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) best make herself useful,--useful in some sort that might gratify
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) ambition;--that was now the question which seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) to be of
most importance.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cousin's letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had been very crafty. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had studied the
whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) character accurately as he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) wrote it. When he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had sat
down to write it he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had been indifferent to the result; but he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had
written it with that care to attain success which a man uses when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
is anxious not to fail in an attempt. Whether or no he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cared to marry
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cousin was a point so little interesting to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that chance might
decide it for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but when chance had decided that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did wish it,
it was necessary for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) honour that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have that for which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
condescended to ask.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been clever and very crafty. <div class="bookquote">``At any rate he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
does me justice,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to herself, when she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read those words
about her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money, and the use which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) proposed to make of it. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is
welcome to it all if it will help him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) career, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has
it as my friend or as my husband.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought of Kate's promise
of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little mite, and declared to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not be
less noble than her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cousin Kate. And would it not be well that she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
should be the means of reconciling George to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) grandfather? George
was the representative of the family,--of a family so old that no one
now knew which had first taken the ancient titular name of some old
Saxon landowner,--the parish, or the man. There had been in old days
some worthy Vavaseurs, as Chaucer calls them, whose rank and bearing
had been adopted on the moorland side. Of these things Alice thought
much, and felt that it should be her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) duty so to act, that future
Vavasors might at any rate not be less in the world than they who
had passed away. In a few years at furthest, George Vavasor must be
Vavasor of Vavasor. Would it not be right that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should help him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) to
make that position honourable?

<p/>They walked on, exchanging now and again a word or two, till the
distant Cumberland mountains began to form themselves in groups of
beauty before their eyes. <div class="bookquote">``There's Helvellyn at last,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm always happy when I see that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And isn't that Kidsty Pike?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>asked Alice. <div class="bookquote">``No; you don't see Kidsty yet. But you will when you
get up to the bank there. That's Scaw Fell on the left;--the round
distant top. I can distinguish it, though I doubt whether you can.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Then they went on again, and were soon at the bank from whence the
sharp top of the mountain which Alice had named was visible. <div class="bookquote">``And now
we are on Swindale, and in five minutes we shall get to the stone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In less than five minutes they were there; and then, but not till
then, the beauty of the little lake, lying down below them in the
quiet bosom of the hills, disclosed itself. A lake should, I think,
be small, and should be seen from above, to be seen in all its glory.
The distance should be such that the shadows of the mountains on its
surface may just be traced, and that some faint idea of the ripple
on the waters may be present to the eye. And the form of the lakes
should be irregular, curving round from its base among the lower
hills, deeper and still deeper into some close nook up among the
mountains from which its head waters spring. It is thus that a lake
should be seen, and it was thus that Hawes Water was seen by them
from the flat stone on the side of Swindale Fell. The basin of the
lake has formed itself into the shape of the figure of 3, and the top
section of the figure lies embosomed among the very wildest of the
Westmoreland mountains. Altogether it is not above three miles long,
and every point of it was to be seen from the spot on which the girls
sat themselves down. The water beneath was still as death, and as
dark,--and looked almost as cold. But the slow clouds were passing
over it, and the shades of darkness on its surface changed themselves
with gradual changes. And though no movement was visible, there
was ever and again in places a slight sheen upon the lake, which
indicated the ripple made by the breeze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm so glad I've come here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, seating herself. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot
bear the idea of coming to Vavasor without seeing one of the lakes at
least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll get over to Windermere one day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think we shall. I don't think it possible that I should stay
long. Kate, I've got a letter to show you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>And there was that in the
tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) voice which instantly put Kate upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mettle.

<p/>Kate seated herself also, and put up her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) hand for the letter. <div class="bookquote">``Is it
from Mr. Grey?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice; <div class="bookquote">``it is not from Mr. Grey.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
companion the paper. Kate before she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had touched it had seen that it
was from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother George; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) opened it looked anxiously
into Alice's face. <div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) offended you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>Kate asked.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: Swindale Fell.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Read it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, <div class="bookquote">``and then we'll talk of it afterwards,--as we
go home.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got up from the stone and walked a step or two
towards the brow of the fell, and stood there looking down upon the
lake, while Kate read the letter. <div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) returned
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate. <div class="bookquote">``Alice, Alice, it will, indeed, be well if you
listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). Oh, Alice, may I hope? Alice, my own Alice, my
darling, my friend! Say that it shall be so.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>And Kate knelt at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
friend's feet upon the heather, and looked up into her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) face with eyes
full of tears. What shall we say of a woman who could be as false as
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been, and yet could be so true?

<p/>Alice made no immediate answer, but still continued to gaze down over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) friend upon the lake. <div class="bookquote">``Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>continued Kate, <div class="bookquote">``I did not think
I should be made so happy this Christmas Day. You could not have the
heart to bring me here and show me this letter in this way, and bid
me read it so calmly, and then tell me that it is all for nothing.
No; you could not do that? Alice, I am so happy. I will so love this
place. I hated it before.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) face down upon the
boulder-stone and kissed it. Still Alice said nothing, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began
to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had gone further than she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had intended. It was
almost impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) now to say that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) answer to George must
be a refusal.

<p/>Then Kate again went on speaking. <div class="bookquote">``But is it not a beautiful letter?
Say, Alice,--is it not a letter of which if you were his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) brother you
would feel proud if another girl had shown it to you? I do feel proud
of him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>). I know that he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is a man with a manly heart and manly courage,
who will yet do manly things. Here out on the mountain, with nobody
near us, with Nature all round us, I ask you on your solemn word as a
woman, do you love him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Love him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--love him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>): as a woman should love her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband. Is not your
heart his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)? Alice, there need be no lies now. If it be so, it should
be your glory to say so, here, to me, as you hold that letter in your
hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can have no such glory, Kate. I have ever loved my cousin; but not
so passionately as you seem to think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then there can be no passion in you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not, Kate. I would sometimes hope that it is so. But come;
we shall be late; and you will be cold sitting there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would sit here all night to be sure that your answer would be as
I would have it. But, Alice, at any rate you shall tell me before I
move what your answer is to be. I know you will not refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); but
make me happy by saying so with your own lips.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell you before you move, Kate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I have not as yet resolved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that is impossible. That is quite impossible. On such a subject
and under such circumstances a woman must resolve at the first
moment. You had resolved, I know, before you had half read the
letter;--though, perhaps, it may not suit you to say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are quite mistaken. Come along and let us walk, and I will tell
you all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>Then Kate arose, and they turned their back to the lake,
and began to make their way homewards. <div class="bookquote">``I have not made up my mind as
to what answer I will give him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>); but I have shown you his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) letter in

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--no; I want nothing of the kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But yet I could not deny myself the comfort of your friendship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Alice, I will not hurry you. I will do nothing that you do not

it not been the longing of all my life? Have I not passed my time
plotting and planning and thinking of it till I have had time to
think of nothing else? Do you know what I suffered when, through
George's fault, the engagement was broken off? Was it not martyrdom
to me,--that horrid time in which your Crichton from Cambridgeshire
was in the ascendant? Did I not suffer the tortures of purgatory
while that went on;--and yet, on the whole, did I not bear them with
patience? And, now, can you be surprised that I am wild with joy when
I begin to see that everything will be as I wish;--for it will be as
I wish, Alice. It may be that you have not resolved to accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Crichton</b></font>).
But you would have resolved to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Crichton</b></font>) instantly had that been
your destined answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Crichton</b></font>) letter.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Beacon Wood Kate</b></font>)</div>There was but little more said
between them on the subject as they were passing over the fell, but
when they were going down the path through the Beacon Wood, Kate
again spoke: <div class="bookquote">``You will not answer him (<font color='blue'><b>Crichton</b></font>) without speaking to me first?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will, at any rate, not send my answer without telling you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said
Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you will let me see it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice; <div class="bookquote">``I will not promise that. But if it is
unfavourable I will show it you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I shall never see it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``But that is quite
enough for me. I by no means wish to criticise the love-sweet words
in which you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Crichton</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Crichton</b></font>) offences are all forgiven. I know how
sweet they will be. Oh, heavens! how I envy him (<font color='blue'><b>Crichton</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then they were at home; and the old man met them at the front door,
glowering at them angrily from out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old leonine eyes, because the
roast beef was already roasted. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) great uncouth silver watch
in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, which was always a quarter of an hour too fast, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
pointed at it fiercely, showing them the minute hand at ten minutes
past the hour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, grandpapa, you are always too fast,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are always too slow, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>the squire</b></font>)</div>said the hungry old squire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, it is not five yet. Is it, Alice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how long are you going to be dressing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not ten minutes;--are we, Alice? And, grandpapa, pray don't wait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't wait! That's what they always say,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) muttered, peevishly.
<div class="bookquote">``As if one would be any better waiting for them after the meat is
on the table.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>But neither Kate nor Alice heard this, as they were
already in their rooms.

<p/>Nothing more was said that evening between Alice and Kate about the
letter; but Kate, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cousin good night inside her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
bedroom door, spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) just one word--<div class="bookquote">``Pray for him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to-night,''
 (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``as you pray for those you love best.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Alice made no
answer, but we may believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was desired to do.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXII.

<p/>Containing an Answer to the Love Letter.


<p/>Alice had had a week allowed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to write her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) answer; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
sent it off before the full week was past. <div class="bookquote">``Why should I keep him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) in
suspense?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``If it is to be so, there can be no good in not
saying so at once.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought, also, that if this were to be
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) destiny it might be well for Mr. Grey that all his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) doubts on the
matter should be dispelled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) badly,--very badly.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had so injured him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) that the remembrance of the injury must always
be a source of misery to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) owed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) above everything to
let him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) know what were her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) intentions as soon as they were settled.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tried to console herself by thinking that the wound to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would
be easy to cure. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) also is not passionate,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said. But in so
saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) deceived herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was a man in whom Love could be very
passionate;--and was, moreover, one in whom Love could hardly be
renewed.

<p/>Each morning Kate asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) answer was written; and on
the third day after Christmas, just before dinner, Alice said that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had written it, and that it was gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it isn't post-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate;--for the post illuminated Vavasor
but three days a week.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have given a boy sixpence to take it to Shap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice,
blushing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what have you said?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>asked Kate, taking hold of the other's arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have kept my promise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice; <div class="bookquote">``and do you keep yours by
asking no further questions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My sister,--my own sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate. And then, as Alice met her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
embrace, there was no longer any doubt as to the nature of the reply.

<p/>After this there was of course much close discussion between them as
to what other steps should now be taken. Kate wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cousin to
write immediately to Mr. Grey, and was somewhat frightened when Alice
declined to do so till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had received a further letter from George.
<div class="bookquote">``You have not proposed any horrid stipulations to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>exclaimed
Kate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you may call horrid stipulations,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice,
gravely. <div class="bookquote">``My conditions have not been very hard, and I do not think
you would have disapproved them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)!--He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is so impetuous! Will he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) disapprove them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have told him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)-- But, Kate, this is just what I did not mean to
tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should there be secrets between us?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There shall be none, then. I have told him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that I cannot bring
myself to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) instantly;--that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) must allow me twelve
months to wear off, if I can in that time, much of sadness and of
self-reproach which has fallen to my lot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Twelve months, Alice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen to me. I have said so. But I have told him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) also that if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
wishes it still, I will at once tell papa and grandpapa that I hold
myself as engaged to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), so that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) may know that I bind myself
to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as far as it is possible that I should do so. And I have
added something else, Kate,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) continued to say after a slight
pause,--<div class="bookquote">``something else which I can tell you, though I could tell it
to no other person. I can tell you because you would do, and will
do the same. I have told him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that any portion of my money is at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
service which may be needed for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) purposes before that twelve
months is over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Alice! No;--no. You shall not do that. It is too generous.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>And
Kate perhaps felt at the moment that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother was a man to whom
such an offer could hardly be made with safety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I have done it. Mercury, with sixpence in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pocket, is already
posting my generosity at Shap. And, to tell the truth, Kate, it is
no more than fair. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has honestly told me that while the old Squire
lives he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) will want my money to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) in a career of which I do
much more than approve. It has been my earnest wish to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) in
Parliament. It will now be the most earnest desire of my heart;--the
one thing as to which I shall feel an intense anxiety. How then can
I have the face to bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wait twelve months for that which is
specially needed in six months' time? It would be like the workhouses
which are so long in giving bread, that in the mean time the wretches
starve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the wretch shan't starve,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate. <div class="bookquote">``My money, small as it is,
will carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) over this bout. I have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) shall have it,
and that I expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) to spend it. Moreover, I have no doubt that
Aunt Greenow would lend me what he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wants.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I should not wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) to borrow from Aunt Greenow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) would
advance him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) the money, as you say, upon stamped paper, and then talk
of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) shall have mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And who are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``You are not going to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) shall not touch your money till you are his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate,
very seriously. <div class="bookquote">``I wish you would consent to change your mind about
this stupid tedious year, and then you might do as you pleased. I
have no doubt such a settlement might be made as to the property
here, when my grandfather hears of it, as would make you ultimately
safe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you think I care to be ultimately safe, as you call it? Kate,
my dear, you do not understand me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose not. And yet I thought that I had known something about
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is because I do not care for the safety of which you speak that I
am now going to become your brother's wife. Do you suppose that I do
not see that I must run much risk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You prefer the excitement of London to the tranquillity, may I say,
of Cambridgeshire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly;--and therefore I have told George that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) shall have my
money whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wants it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Kate was very persistent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) objection to this scheme till
George's answer came. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) answer to Alice was accompanied by a letter
to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sister, and after that Kate said nothing more about the
money question. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said no more then; but it must not therefore be
supposed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was less determined than she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had been that no part
of Alice's fortune should be sacrificed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) brother's wants;--at
any rate before Alice should become her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) brother's wife. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
brother's letter for the moment stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mouth. It would be
necessary that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) again spoke to
Alice.

<p/>In what words Alice had written her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) assent it will be necessary that
the reader should know, in order that something may be understood
of the struggle which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) made upon the occasion; but they shall be
given presently, when I come to speak of George Vavasor's position as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) received them. George's reply was very short and apparently very
frank. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) deprecated the delay of twelve months, and still hoped to
be able to induce her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to be more lenient to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to
write to Mr. Grey at once,--and as regarded the Squire he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
_carte blanche_ to act as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) pleased. If the Squire required any
kind of apology, expression of sorrow,--and asking for pardon, or
such like, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), George, would, under the circumstances as they now
existed, comply with the requisition most willingly. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would regard
it as a simple form, made necessary by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) coming marriage. As to
Alice's money, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heartily for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) confidence. If the
nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) coming contest at Chelsea should make it necessary,
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would use her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) offer as frankly as it had been made. Such was his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
letter to Alice. What was contained in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) letter to Kate, Alice
never knew.

<p/>Then came the business of telling this new love tale,--the
third which poor Alice had been forced to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father and
grandfather;--and a grievous task it was. In this matter she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) feared
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father much more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) grandfather, and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) resolved
to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) grandfather first;--or, rather, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
would tell the Squire, and that in the mean time Kate should talk to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Grandpapa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) the morning after she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had received her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
cousin's second letter.--The old man was in the habit of breakfasting
alone in a closet of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own, which was called his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dressing-room,
but in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept no appurtenances for dressing, but in lieu of
them a large collection of old spuds and sticks and horse's-bits.
There was a broken spade here, and a hoe or two; and a small table
in the corner was covered with the debris of tradesmen's bills
from Penrith, and dirty scraps which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was wont to call his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) farm
accounts.--<div class="bookquote">``Grandpapa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, rushing away at once into the
middle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) subject, <div class="bookquote">``you told me the other day that you thought
I ought to be--married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I, my dear? Well, yes; so I did. And so you ought;--I mean to
that Mr. Grey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is impossible, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what's the use of your coming and talking to me about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>This made Alice's task not very easy; but, nevertheless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
persevered. <div class="bookquote">``I am come, grandpapa, to tell you of another
engagement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Another!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). And by the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) accused his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
granddaughter of having a larger number of favoured suitors than
ought to fall to the lot of any young lady. It was very hard upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), but still she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that some years ago I was to have been married
to my cousin George;'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) paused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I remember you told me then that you were much pleased.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I was. George was doing well then; or,--which is more
likely,--had made us believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was doing well. Have you made it
up with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that's the meaning of your jilting Mr. Grey, is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Alice! It is hard to explain how heavy a blow fell upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) from the open utterance of that word! Of all words in the
language it was the one which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) now most dreaded. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had called
herself a jilt, with that inaudible voice which one uses in making
self-accusations;--but hitherto no lips had pronounced the odious
word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ears. Poor Alice! She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was a jilt; and perhaps it may have
been well that the old man should tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Grandpapa!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said; and there was that in the tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) voice
which somewhat softened the Squire's heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, I don't want to be ill-natured. So you are going at
last to marry George, are you? I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'ll treat you well; that's
all. Does your father approve of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have told you first, sir;--because I wish to obtain your consent
to seeing George again here as your grandson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, snarling;--<div class="bookquote">``never!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has been wrong, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will beg your pardon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has been wrong! Didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) want to squander every shilling of
the property,--property which has never belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>);--property
which I could give to Tom, Dick, or Harry to-morrow, if I liked?--If
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has been wrong!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not defending him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), sir;--but I thought that, perhaps, on such
an occasion as this--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A Tom Fool's occasion! You've got money of your own. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'ll spend all
that now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) will be less likely to do so if you will recognise him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) as your
heir. Pray believe, sir, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is not the sort of man that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) must be a very clever sort of man, I think, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has talked
you out of such a husband as John Grey. It's astounding to me,--with
that ugly mug of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)! Well, my dear, if your father approves of it,
and if George will ask my pardon,--but I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ever will--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will, sir. I am his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) messenger for as much as that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you are, are you? Then you may also be my messenger to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) that, for your sake, I will let him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) come back here. I know
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'ll insult me the first day; but I'll try and put up with it,--for
your sake, my dear. Of course I must know what your father thinks
about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/>It may be imagined that Kate's success was even less than that which
Alice achieved. <div class="bookquote">``I knew it would be so,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Vavasor/Mr. John Vavasor/Mr. Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said John Vavasor, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
niece first told him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>);--and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) spoke he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) hand upon the
table. <div class="bookquote">``I knew all along how it would be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why should it not be so, Uncle John?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is your brother, and I will not tell you why.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is a spendthrift?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is as unsafe a man as ever I knew to be intrusted
with the happiness of any young woman. That is all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are hard upon him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), uncle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps so. Tell Alice this from me,--that as I have never yet been
able to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to think anything of my opinion, I do not at all
expect that I shall be able to induce her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to do so now. I will not
even make the attempt. As my son-in-law I will not receive George
Vavasor. Tell Alice that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice was told her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father's message; but Kate in telling it felt no
deep regret. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) well knew that Alice would not be turned back from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) present intention by her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father's wishes. Nor would it have
been very reasonable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father had for many years
relieved himself from the burden of a father's cares, and now had
hardly the right to claim a father's privileges.

<p/>We will now go once again to George Vavasor's room in Cecil Street,
in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) received Alice's letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was dressing when it was
first brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>); and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) recognised the handwriting he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) put
it down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) toilet table unopened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) put it down, and went on
brushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) hair, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) were determined to prove to himself
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was indifferent as to the tidings which it might contain.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) went on brushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) hair, and cleaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) teeth, and tying his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>)
cravat carefully over his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) turned-down collar, while the unopened
letter lay close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) hand. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was thinking of it,--of
course he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was anxious,--of course his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) eye went to it from moment
to moment. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) carried it with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) into the sitting-room still
unopened, and so it remained until after the girl had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>)
tea and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) toast. <div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) threw himself into his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>)
arm-chair, <div class="bookquote">``let us see what the girl of my heart says to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The
girl of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) heart said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) as follows:--


<p/>MY DEAR GEORGE,

<p/>I feel great difficulty in answering your letter. Could I
have my own way, I should make no answer to it at present,
but leave it for the next six months, so that then such
answer might hereafter be made as circumstances should
seem to require. This will be little flattering to you,
but it is less flattering to myself. Whatever answer I may
make, how can anything in this affair be flattering either
to you or to me? We have been like children who have
quarrelled over our game of play, till now, at the close
of our little day of pleasure, we are fain to meet each
other in tears, and acknowledge that we have looked for
delights where no delights were to be found.

<p/>Kate, who is here, talks to me of passionate love. There
is no such passion left to me;--nor, as I think, to you
either. It would not now be possible that you and I should
come together on such terms as that. We could not stand
up together as man and wife with any hope of a happy
marriage, unless we had both agreed that such happiness
might be had without passionate love.

<p/>You will see from all this that I do not refuse your
offer. Without passion, I have for you a warm affection,
which enables me to take a livelier interest in your
career than in any other of the matters which are around
me. Of course, if I become your wife that interest will be
still closer and dearer, and I do feel that I can take in
it that concern which a wife should have in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's
affairs.

<p/>If it suits you, I will become your wife;--but it cannot
be quite at once. I have suffered much from the past
conflicts of my life, and there has been very much with
which I must reproach myself. I know that I have behaved
badly. Sometimes I have to undergo the doubly bitter
self-accusation of having behaved in a manner which the
world will call unfeminine. You must understand that I
have not passed through this unscathed, and I must beg
you to allow me some time for a cure. A perfect cure I
may never expect, but I think that in twelve months from
this time I may so far have recovered my usual spirit and
ease of mind as to enable me to devote myself to your
happiness. Dear George, if you will accept me under such
circumstances, I will be your wife, and will endeavour to
do my duty by you faithfully.

<p/>I have said that even now, as your cousin, I take a lively
interest in your career,--of course I mean your career as
a politician,--and especially in your hopes of entering
Parliament. I understand, accurately as I think, what you
have said about my fortune, and I perfectly appreciate
your truth and frankness. If I had nothing of my own you,
in your circumstances, could not possibly take me as your
wife. I know, moreover, that your need of assistance from
my means is immediate rather than prospective. My money
may be absolutely necessary to you within this year,
during which, as I tell you most truly, I cannot bring
myself to become a married woman. But my money shall
be less cross-grained than myself. You will take it as
frankly as I mean it when I say, that whatever you want
for your political purposes shall be forthcoming at your
slightest wish. Dear George, let me have the honour and
glory of marrying a man who has gained a seat in the
Parliament of Great Britain! Of all positions which a man
may attain that, to me, is the grandest.

<p/>I shall wait for a further letter from you before I speak
either to my father or to my grandfather. If you can tell
me that you accede to my views, I will at once try to
bring about a reconciliation between you and the Squire.
I think that that will be almost easier than inducing my
father to look with favour upon our marriage. But I need
hardly say that should either one or the other oppose
it,--or should both do so,--that would not turn me from my
purpose.

<p/>I also wait for your answer to write a last line to Mr.
Grey.

<p/>Your affectionate cousin,

<p/>ALICE VAVASOR.


<p/>George Vavasor when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had read the letter threw it carelessly from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) on to the breakfast table, and began to munch his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) toast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) threw
it carelessly from him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>), as though taking a certain pride in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
carelessness. <div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``so be it. It is probably the
best thing that I could do, whatever the effect may be on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) newspaper. But before the day was over he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had made
many plans,--plans made almost unconsciously,--as to the benefit
which might accrue to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) from the offer which she (<font color='blue'><b>VAVASOR</b></font>) had made of her (<font color='blue'><b>VAVASOR</b></font>)
money. And before night he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had written that reply to her (<font color='blue'><b>VAVASOR</b></font>) of which we
have heard the contents; and had written also to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) sister Kate a
letter, of which Kate had kept the contents to herself.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIII.

<p/>Monkshade.


<p/>When the first of the new year came round Lady Glencora was not
keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) appointment at Lady Monk's house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) went to Gatherum
Castle, and let us hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) enjoyed the magnificent Christmas
hospitality of the Duke; but when the time came for moving on to
Monkshade, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was indisposed, and Mr. Palliser went thither alone.
Lady Glencora returned to Matching and remained at home, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
husband was away, in company with the two Miss Pallisers.

<p/>When the tidings reached Monkshade that Lady Glencora was not to
be expected, Burgo Fitzgerald was already there, armed with such
pecuniary assistance as George Vavasor had been able to wrench out
of the hands of Mr. Magruin. <div class="bookquote">``Burgo,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Magruin</b></font>) aunt, catching him (<font color='blue'><b>Magruin</b></font>) one
morning near his (<font color='blue'><b>Magruin</b></font>) bedroom door as he (<font color='blue'><b>Magruin</b></font>) was about to go down-stairs in
hunting trim, <div class="bookquote">``Burgo, your old flame, Lady Glencora, is not coming
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Glencora not coming!''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo, betraying by his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) look and the
tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) voice too clearly that this change in the purpose of a
married lady was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) of more importance than it should have been.
Such betrayal, however, to Lady Monk was not perhaps matter of much
moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) is not coming. It can't be matter of any moment to you now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, by heavens, it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) hand up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
forehead, and leaning back against the wall of the passage as though
in despair. <div class="bookquote">``It is matter of moment to me. I am the most unfortunate
devil that ever lived.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fie, Burgo, fie! You must not speak in that way of a married woman.
I begin to think it is better that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should not come.''  (<font color='red'><b>another man</b></font>)</div>At this
moment another man booted and spurred came down the passage, upon
whom Lady Monk smiled sweetly, speaking some pretty little word as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passed. Burgo spoke never a word, but still stood leaning against
the wall, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) forehead, showing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had heard
something which had moved him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) greatly. <div class="bookquote">``Come back into your room,
Burgo,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) aunt; and they both went in at the door that was
nearest to them, for Lady Monk had been on the look-out for him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), and
had caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) appeared in the passage. <div class="bookquote">``If this does
annoy you, you should keep it to yourself! What will people say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I help what they say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you would not wish to injure her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), I suppose? I thought it best
to tell you, for fear you should show any special sign of surprise
if you heard of it first in public. It is very weak in you to allow
yourself to feel that sort of regard for a married woman. If you
cannot constrain yourself I shall be afraid to let you meet her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in
Brook Street.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div><p/>Burgo looked for a moment into his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) aunt's face without answering her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>),
and then turned away towards the door. <div class="bookquote">``You can do as you please
about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but you know as well as I do what I have made
up my mind to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Burgo; I know nothing of the kind. But do you go
down-stairs to breakfast, and don't look like that when you go among
the people there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monk</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Monk was a woman now about fifty years of age, who had been a
great beauty, and who was still handsome in her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) advanced age. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>)
figure was very good. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) was tall and of fine proportion, though by
no means verging to that state of body which our excellent American
friend and critic Mr. Hawthorne has described as beefy and has
declared to be the general condition of English ladies of Lady Monk's
age. Lady Monk was not beefy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) was a comely, handsome, upright,
dame,--one of whom, as regards her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) outward appearance, England might
be proud,--and of whom Sir Cosmo Monk was very proud. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) had come of
the family of the Worcestershire Fitzgeralds, of whom it used to be
said that there never was one who was not beautiful and worthless.
Looking at Lady Monk you would hardly think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) could be a
worthless woman; but there were one or two who professed to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>),
and who declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) was a true scion of the family to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>)
belonged;--that even her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) husband's ample fortune had suffered from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) extravagance, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) had quarrelled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) only son, and
had succeeded in marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) daughter to the greatest fool in the
peerage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) had striven very hard to bring about a marriage between
her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) nephew and the great heiress, and was a woman not likely to
pardon those who had foiled her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>At this moment Burgo felt very certain that his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) aunt was aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
purpose, and could not forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) for pretending to be innocent of
it. In this he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was most ungrateful, as well as unreasonable,--and
very indiscreet also. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) been a man who ever reflected he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) must
have known that such a woman as his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) aunt could only assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) as
long as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might be presumed to be ignorant of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) intention. But
Burgo never reflected. The Fitzgeralds never reflected till they were
nearer forty than thirty, and then people began to think worse of
them than they had thought before.

<p/>When Burgo reached the dining-room there were many men there, but no
ladies. Sir Cosmo Monk, a fine bald-headed hale man of about sixty,
was standing up at the sideboard, cutting a huge game pie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) was a
man also who did not reflect much, but who contrived to keep straight
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) course through the world without much reflection. <div class="bookquote">``Palliser
is coming without her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) loud clear voice, thinking
nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) wife's nephew. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s ill, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>said one man. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s a deal the better fellow of
the two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has twice more go in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) than Planty Pall,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Planty is no fool, I can tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cosmo/Cosmo Monk</b></font>)</div>said Sir Cosmo, coming to the
table with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) plate full of pie. <div class="bookquote">``We think he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'s about the most
rising man we have.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cosmo/Cosmo Monk</b></font>)</div>Sir Cosmo was the member for his (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) county, and
was a Liberal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) had once, when a much younger man, been at the
Treasury, and had since always spoken of the Whig Government as
though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself were in some sort a part of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Burgo, do you hear that Palliser is coming without his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife?''
 (<font color='red'><b>man man</b></font>)</div>said one man,--a very young man, who hardly knew what had been the
circumstances of the case. The others, when they saw Burgo enter, had
been silent on the subject of Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard,--and be d--d to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo. Then there was
suddenly a silence in the room, and everyone seemed to attend
assiduously to his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) breakfast. It was very terrible, this clear
expression of a guilty meaning with reference to the wife of another
man! Burgo regarded neither his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) plate nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) cup, but thrusting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) breeches pockets, sat back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) chair with the
blackness as of a thunder cloud upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) brow.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``I have heard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Burgo, you had better eat your breakfast,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cosmo/Cosmo Monk</b></font>)</div>said Sir Cosmo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want any breakfast.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) took, however, a bit of toast,
and crumbling it up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) hand as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) put a morsel into his (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) mouth,
went away to the sideboard and filled for himself a glass of cherry
brandy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you don't eat any breakfast the less of that you take the
better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cosmo/Cosmo Monk</b></font>)</div>said Sir Cosmo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm all right now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>), and coming back to the table, went
through some form of making a meal with a roll and a cup of tea.

<p/>They who were then present used afterwards to say that they should
never forget that breakfast. There had been something, they declared,
in the tone of Burgo's voice when he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) uttered his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) curse against Mr.
Palliser, which had struck them all with dread. There had, too, they
said, been a blackness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) face, so terrible to be seen, that it
had taken from them all the power of conversation. Sir Cosmo, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>)
had broken the ominous silence, had done so with a manifest struggle.
The loud clatter of glasses with which Burgo had swallowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) dram,
as though resolved to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was regardless who might know that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was drinking, added to the feeling. It may easily be understood
that there was no further word spoken at that breakfast-table about
Planty Pall or his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) wife.

<p/>On that day Burgo Fitzgerald startled all those who saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) by the
mad way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) rode. Early in the day there was no excuse for
any such rashness. The hounds went from wood to wood, and men went in
troops along the forest sides as they do on such occasions. But Burgo
was seen to cram his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) horse at impracticable places, and to ride at
gates and rails as though resolved to do himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) uncle's
steed a mischief. This was so apparent that some friend spoke to Sir
Cosmo Monk about it. <div class="bookquote">``I can do nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cosmo/Cosmo Monk</b></font>)</div>said Sir Cosmo. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) is a
man whom no one's words will control. Something has ruffled him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) this
morning, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) must run his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) chance till he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) becomes quiet.''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>In the
afternoon there was a good run, and Burgo again rode as hard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
could make his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) horse carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>);--but then there was the usual excuse
for hard riding; and such riding in a straight run is not dangerous,
as it is when the circumstances of the occasion do not warrant it,
But, be that as it may, Burgo went on to the end of the day without
accident, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) went home, assured Sir Cosmo, in a voice which
was almost cheery, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) mare Spinster was by far the best thing
in the Monkshade stables. Indeed Spinster made quite a character that
day, and was sold at the end of the season for three hundred guineas
on the strength of it. I am, however, inclined to believe that there
was nothing particular about the mare. Horses always catch the
temperament of their riders, and when a man wishes to break his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will generally find a horse willing to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in appearance,
but able to save him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the performance. Burgo, at any rate, did not
break his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) neck, and appeared at the dinner-table in a better humour
than that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had displayed in the morning.

<p/>On the day appointed Mr. Palliser reached Monkshade. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was, in a
manner, canvassing for the support of the Liberal party, and it would
not have suited him (<font color='blue'><b>Liberal</b></font>) to show any indifference to the invitation of
so influential a man as Sir Cosmo. Sir Cosmo had a little party of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) own in the House, consisting of four or five other respectable
country gentlemen, who troubled themselves little with thinking, and
who mostly had bald heads. Sir Cosmo was a man with whom it was quite
necessary that such an aspirant as Mr. Palliser should stand well, and
therefore Mr. Palliser came to Monkshade, although Lady Glencora was
unable to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are so sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monk</b></font>)</div>said Lady Monk. <div class="bookquote">``We have been looking forward to
having Lady Glencora with us beyond everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Palliser declared that Lady Glencora herself was overwhelmed with
grief in that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) should have been debarred from making this special
visit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had, however, been so unwell at Gatherum, the anxious
husband declared, as to make it unsafe for her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) to go again away from
home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope it is nothing serious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monk</b></font>)</div>said Lady Monk, with a look of grief
so well arranged that any stranger would have thought that all the
Pallisers must have been very dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) heart. Then Mr. Palliser
went on to explain that Lady Glencora had unfortunately been foolish.
During one of those nights of hard frost she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had gone out among the
ruins at Matching, to show them by moonlight to a friend. The friend
had thoughtlessly, foolishly, and in a manner which Mr. Palliser
declared to be very reprehensible, allowed Lady Glencora to remain
among the ruins till she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had caught cold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How very wrong!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monk</b></font>)</div>said Lady Monk with considerable emphasis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was very wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser, speaking of poor Alice almost
maliciously. <div class="bookquote">``However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) caught a cold which, unfortunately, has
become worse at my uncle's, and so I was obliged to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Monk perceived that Mr. Palliser had in truth left his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife
behind because he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) to be ill, and not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was
afraid of Burgo Fitzgerald. So accomplished a woman as Lady Monk felt
no doubt that the wife's absence was caused by fear of the lover, and
not by any cold caught in viewing ruins by moonlight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) was not to
be deceived in such a matter. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) became aware that Mr. Palliser
had been deceived. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) was right in this we must go back for a
moment, and say a word of things as they went on at Matching after
Alice Vavasor had left that place.

<p/>Alice had told Miss Palliser that steps ought to be taken, whatever
might be their cost, to save Lady Glencora from the peril of a visit
to Monkshade. To this Miss Palliser had assented, and, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) left
Alice, was determined to tell Mr. Palliser the whole story. But when
the time for doing so had come, her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) courage failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could not
find words in which to warn the husband that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife would not be
safe in the company of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) old lover. The task with Lady Glencora
herself, bad as that would be, might be easier, and this task she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) at
last undertook,--not without success.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Glencora,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) found a fitting opportunity, <div class="bookquote">``you
won't be angry, I hope, if I say a word to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends very much upon what the word is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.
And here it must be acknowledged that Mr. Palliser's wife had not done
much to ingratiate herself with Mr. Palliser's cousins;--not perhaps
so much as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should have done, seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) found them in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
husband's house. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had taught herself to think that they were hard,
stiff, and too proud of bearing the name of Palliser. Perhaps some
little attempt may have been made by one or both of them to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
something, and it need hardly be said that such an attempt on the
part of a husband's unmarried female relations would not be forgiven
by a young bride. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had undoubtedly been ungracious, and of this
Miss Palliser was well aware.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,--the word shall be as little unpleasant as I can make it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Palliser, already appreciating fully the difficulty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
task.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why say anything that is unpleasant? However, if it is to be
said, let us have it over at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are going to Monkshade, I believe, with Plantagenet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--and what of that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Glencora, I think you had better not go. Do you not think so
yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who has been talking to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, turning upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
very sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody has been talking to me;--not in the sense you mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Plantagenet has spoken to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a word,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Palliser. <div class="bookquote">``You may be sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would not
utter a word on such a subject to anyone unless it were to yourself.
But, dear Glencora, you should not go there;--I mean it in all
kindness and love,--I do indeed.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Saying this she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) hand to
Glencora, and Glencora took it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) in a low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I do. The world is so hard and cruel in what it says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not care two straws for what the world says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) might care.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not my fault. I do not want to go to Monkshade. Lady Monk was
my friend once, but I do not care if I never see her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) again. I did not
arrange this visit. It was Plantagenet who did it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) will not take you there if you say you do not wish it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have said so, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) told me that I must go. You will hardly
believe me,--but I condescended even to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) why I thought it
better to remain away. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) told me, in answer, that it was a silly
folly which I must live down, and that it did not become me to be
afraid of any man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you are not afraid, but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid. That is just the truth. I am afraid;--but what can I do
more than I have done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was very terrible to Miss Palliser. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had not thought that
Lady Glencora would say so much, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) felt a true regret in having
been made to hear words which so nearly amounted to a confession.
But for this there was no help now. There were not many more words
between them, and we already know the result of the conversation.
Lady Glencora became so ill from the effects of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) imprudent
lingering among the ruins that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was unable to go to Monkshade.

<p/>Mr. Palliser remained three days at Monkshade, and cemented his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
political alliance with Sir Cosmo much in the same way as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had
before done with the Duke of St. Bungay. There was little or nothing
said about politics, and certainly not a word that could be taken as
any definite party understanding between the men; but they sat at
dinner together at the same table, drank a glass of wine or two out
of the same decanters, and dropped a chance word now and again about
the next session of Parliament. I do not know that anything more had
been expected either by Mr. Palliser or by Sir Cosmo; but it seemed
to be understood when Mr. Palliser went away that Sir Cosmo was of
opinion that that young scion of a ducal house ought to become the
future Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Whig Government.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't see that there's so much in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>member</b></font>)</div>said one young member of
Parliament to Sir Cosmo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I rather think that there is, all the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet.
<div class="bookquote">``There's a good deal in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I believe! I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s not very
bright, but I don't know that we want brightness. A bright financier
is the most dangerous man in the world. We've had enough of that
already. Give me sound common sense, with just enough of the gab in
a man to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to say what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s got to say! We don't want more
than that nowadays.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cosmo/Cosmo Monk</b></font>)</div>From which it became evident that Sir Cosmo was
satisfied with the new political candidate for high place.

<p/>Lady Monk took an occasion to introduce Mr. Palliser to Burgo
Fitzgerald; with what object it is difficult to say, unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) was
anxious to make mischief between the men. Burgo scowled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>); but
Mr. Palliser did not notice the scowl, and put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
late rival most affably. Burgo was forced to take it, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) did
so made a little speech. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry that we have not the pleasure of
seeing Lady Glencora with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) is unfortunately indisposed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo--<div class="bookquote">``very sorry indeed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) turned
his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) back and walked away. The few words he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had spoken, and the manner
in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had carried himself, had been such as to make all those
around them notice it. Each of them knew that Lady Glencora's name
should not have been in Burgo's mouth, and all felt a fear not
easily to be defined that something terrible would come of it. But
Mr. Palliser himself did not seem to notice anything, or to fear
anything; and nothing terrible did come of it during that visit of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) to Monkshade.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIV.

<p/>Mr. Vavasor Speaks to His (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) Daughter.


<p/>Alice Vavasor returned to London with her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) father, leaving Kate at
Vavasor Hall with her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) grandfather. The journey was not a pleasant
one. Mr. Vavasor knew that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) duty to do something,--to
take some steps with the view of preventing the marriage which his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
daughter meditated; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) did not know what that something should
be, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) did know that, whatever it might be, the doing of it
would be thoroughly disagreeable. When they started from Vavasor he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
had as yet hardly spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) a word upon the subject. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot
congratulate you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had simply said. <div class="bookquote">``I hope the time may come,
papa, when you will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice had answered; and that had been all.

<p/>The squire had promised that he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) would consent to a reconciliation
with his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) grandson, if Alice's father would express himself satisfied
with the proposed marriage. John Vavasor had certainly expressed
nothing of the kind. <div class="bookquote">``I think so badly of him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had said, speaking
to the old man of George, <div class="bookquote">``that I would rather know that almost any
other calamity was to befall her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), than that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) should be united
to him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Then the squire, with his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) usual obstinacy, had taken up
the cudgels on behalf of his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) grandson; and had tried to prove that
the match after all would not be so bad in its results as his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) son
seemed to expect. <div class="bookquote">``It would do very well for the property,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``I would settle the estate on their eldest son, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could
not touch it; and I don't see why he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) shouldn't reform as well as
another.''  (<font color='red'><b>John Vavasor/Mr. John Vavasor/Mr. Vavasor</b></font>)</div>John Vavasor had then declared that George was thoroughly
bad, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was an adventurer; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) to be a ruined
man, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would never reform. The squire upon this had waxed
angry, and in this way George obtained aid and assistance down at
the old house, which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) certainly had no right to expect. When Alice
wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) grandfather good-bye the old man gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) a message to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
grandson. <div class="bookquote">``You may tell him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that I will never see him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
again unless he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) begs my pardon for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) personal bad conduct to me,
but that if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) marries you, I will take care that the property is
properly settled upon his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) child and yours. I shall always be glad to
see you, my dear; and for your sake, I will see him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) will humble
himself to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>There was no word spoken then about her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father's
consent; and Alice, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) left Vavasor, felt that the squire was
rather her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) friend than her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) enemy in regard to this thing which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
contemplated. That her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father was and would be an uncompromising
enemy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),--uncompromising though probably not energetical,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
was well aware; and, therefore, the journey up to London was not
comfortable.

<p/>Alice had resolved, with great pain to herself, that in this matter
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) owed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father no obedience. <div class="bookquote">``There cannot be obedience on one
side,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself, <div class="bookquote">``without protection and support on the
other.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Now it was quite true that John Vavasor had done little in
the way of supporting or protecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) daughter. Early in life,
before she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had resided under the same roof with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) in London, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
had, as it were, washed his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) hands of all solicitude regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>);
and having no other ties of family, had fallen into habits of life
which made it almost impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) as any other
father would live with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) child. Then, when there first sprang
up between them that manner of sharing the same house without any
joining together of their habits of life, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had excused himself
to himself by saying that Alice was unlike other girls, and that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) required no protection. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) fortune was her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own, and at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own
disposal. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) character was such that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) showed no inclination to
throw the burden of such disposal on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father's shoulders. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was
steady, too, and given to no pursuits which made it necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
should watch closely over her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was a girl, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thought, who could
do as well without surveillance as with it,--as well, or perhaps
better. So it had come to pass that Alice had been the free mistress
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own actions, and had been left to make the most she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own hours. It cannot be supposed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had eaten her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) lonely
dinners in Queen Anne Street night after night, week after week,
month after month, without telling herself that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father was
neglecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not perceive that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spent every evening in
society, but never an evening in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) society, without feeling that
the tie between her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) and him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was not the strong bond which usually
binds a father to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) child. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was well aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been
ill-used in being thus left desolate in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had uttered no
word of complaint; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had learned, without being aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
was doing so, to entertain a firm resolve that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father should not
guide her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) path through life. In that affair of John Grey they
had both for a time thought alike, and Mr. Vavasor had believed that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) theory with reference to Alice had been quite correct. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
been left to herself, and was going to dispose of herself in a way
than which nothing could be more eligible. But evil days were now
coming, and Mr. Vavasor, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) travelled up to London, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
daughter seated opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) in the railway carriage, felt that
now, at last, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) must interfere. In part of the journey they had the
carriage to themselves, and Mr. Vavasor thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would begin
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had to say; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) put it off till others joined them, and
then there was no further opportunity for such conversation as that
which would be necessary between them. They reached home about
eight in the evening, having dined on the road. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) will be tired
to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) said to himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) went off to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) club, <div class="bookquote">``and I
will speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to-morrow.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Alice specially felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) going on this
evening. When two persons had together the tedium of such a journey
as that from Westmoreland up to London, there should be some feeling
between them to bind them together while enjoying the comfort of the
evening. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) stayed and sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tea-table, Alice would
at any rate have endeavoured to be soft with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) in any discussion
that might have been raised; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) went away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) at once,
leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to think alone over the perils of the life before her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I
want to speak to you after breakfast to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) said as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) went
out. Alice answered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should be there,--as a matter of course.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) scorned to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was always there,--always alone at
home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had never uttered a word of complaint, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would not
begin now.

<p/>The discussion after breakfast the next day was commenced with
formal and almost ceremonial preparation. The father and daughter
breakfasted together, with the knowledge that the discussion was
coming. It did not give to either of them a good appetite, and very
little was said at table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you come up-stairs?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) perceived that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
father had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps that will be best,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) into the
drawing-room in which the fire had just been lit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I must speak to you about this engagement of
yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't you sit down, papa? It does look so dreadful, your standing up
over one in that way.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had placed himself on the rug with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) back
to the incipient fire, but now, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) request, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sat himself down
opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was greatly grieved when I heard of this at Vavasor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry that you should be grieved, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was grieved. I must confess that I never could understand why you
treated Mr. Grey as you have done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa, that's done and past. Pray let that be among the bygones.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) know yet of your engagement with your cousin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) will know it by this time to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I beg of you, as a great favour, to postpone your letter to
him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>To this Alice made no answer. <div class="bookquote">``I have not troubled you with
many such requests, Alice. Will you tell me that this one shall be
granted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think that I owe it to him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) as an imperative duty to let him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) know
the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you may change your mind again.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice found that this was
hard to bear and hard to answer; but there was a certain amount of

impossible,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) replied, in words that were barely audible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--exactly so,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``And therefore it will be better
that you should postpone any such communication.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For how long do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Till you and I shall have agreed together that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) should be told.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, papa; I will not consent to that. I consider myself bound to let
him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) know the truth without delay. I have done him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) a great injury, and
I must put an end to that as soon as possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have done him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) an injury certainly, my dear;--a very great
injury,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vavasor, going away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) object about the
proposed letter; <div class="bookquote">``and I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) will feel it as such to the last

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not. I believe that it will not be so. I feel sure that it

When you simply told me that you intended to--.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice winced,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) feared to hear from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father that odious word which her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
grandfather had used to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>); and indeed the word had been on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
father's lips, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had refrained and spared her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``that you
intended to break your engagement with Mr. Grey,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``I
said little or nothing to you. I would not ask you to marry any man,
even though you had yourself promised to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But when you
tell me that you are engaged to your cousin George, the matter is
very different. I do not think well of your cousin. Indeed I think
anything but well of him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). It is my duty to tell you that the world
speaks very ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) paused, but Alice remained silent. <div class="bookquote">``When
you were about to travel with him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``I ought perhaps to
have told you the same. But I did not wish to pain you or his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) sister;

I had heard before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As you did not tell me before, I think you might spare me now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear; I cannot allow you to sacrifice yourself without
telling you that you are doing so. If it were not for your money he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
would never think of marrying you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of that I am well aware,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) has told me so himself
very plainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet you will marry him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I will. It seems to me, papa, that there is a great deal
of false feeling about this matter of money in marriage,--or rather,
perhaps, a great deal of pretended feeling. Why should I be angry
with a man for wishing to get that for which every man is struggling?
At this point of George's career the use of money is essential to
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could not marry without it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better then give him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) your money without yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vavasor, jumping up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) seat. <div class="bookquote">``You mean to give

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me this, Alice; has he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) got any of it as yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a shilling. Papa, pray do not look at me like that. If I had no
thought of marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) you would not call me mad because I lent to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should only say that so much of your fortune was thrown away, and

was altogether unworthy of you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We were both younger, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, speaking very softly, but
very seriously. <div class="bookquote">``We were both much younger then, and looked at life
with other eyes than those which we now use. For myself I expected
much then, which I now seem hardly to regard at all; and as for him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>),
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was then attached to pleasures to which I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) has now
learned to be indifferent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Psha!''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>ejaculated the father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can only speak as I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>continued Alice. <div class="bookquote">``And I think I may
perhaps know more of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) manner of life than you do, papa. But I am
prepared to run risks now which I feared before. Even though he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) were
all that you think him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) to be, I would still endeavour to do my duty
to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), and to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) to other things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it you expect to get by marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Vavasor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A husband whose mode of thinking is congenial to my own,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>answered
Alice. <div class="bookquote">``A husband who proposes to himself a career in life with which
I can sympathize. I think that I may perhaps help my cousin in the
career which he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) has chosen, and that alone is a great reason why I
should attempt to do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With your money?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vavasor with a sneer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Partly with my money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, disdaining to answer the sneer.
<div class="bookquote">``Though it were only with my money, even that would be something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Alice, as your father, I can only implore you to pause before
you commit yourself to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hands. If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) demands money from you, and
you are minded to give it to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) have it in moderation.
Anything will be better than marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I know that I cannot
hinder you; you are as much your own mistress as I am my own
master,--or rather a great deal more, as my income depends on my
going to that horrid place in Chancery Lane. But yet I suppose you
must think something of your father's wishes and your father's
opinion. It will not be pleasant for you to stand at the altar
without my being there near you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>To this Alice made no answer; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) told herself that it had not
been pleasant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to have stood at so many places during the last
four years,--and to have found herself so often alone,--without her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
father being near to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). That had been his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fault, and it was not now
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) power to remedy the ill-effects of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has any day been fixed between you and him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing has been said about that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; something has been said. I have told him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) that it cannot be for
a year yet. It is because I told him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) that, that I told him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) also that
he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) should have my money when he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) wanted it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not all of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vavasor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) will need it all. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) intends to stand again for
Chelsea, and it is the great expense of the election which makes
him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) want money. You are not to suppose that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) has asked me for it.
When I made him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) understand that I did not wish to marry quite yet,
I offered him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) the use of that which would be ultimately his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) has accepted it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) answered me just as I had intended,--that when the need came he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
would take me at my word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, Alice, I will tell you what is my belief. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) will drain you of
every shilling of your money, and when that is gone, there will be no
more heard of the marriage. We must take a small house in some cheap
part of the town and live on my income as best we may. I shall go
and insure my life, so that you may not absolutely starve when I
die.''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Having said this, Mr. Vavasor went away, not immediately to the
insurance office, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) words seemed to imply, but to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) club where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) sat alone, reading the newspaper, very gloomily, till the time
came for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) afternoon rubber of whist, and the club dinner bill for
the day was brought under his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) eye.

<p/>Alice had no such consolations in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) solitude. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had fought her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
battle with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father tolerably well, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was now called upon
to fight a battle with herself, which was one much more difficult
to win. Was her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) betrothed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) now must regard him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>),
the worthless, heartless, mercenary rascal which her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father painted
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)? There had certainly been a time, and that not very long distant,
in which Alice herself had been almost constrained so to regard him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
Since that any change for the better in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been
grounded on evidence given either by himself or by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sister Kate.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had done nothing to inspire her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) with any confidence, unless his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
reckless daring in coming forward to contest a seat in Parliament
could be regarded as a doing of something. And he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had owned himself
to be a man almost penniless; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had spoken of himself as being
utterly reckless,--as being one whose standing in the world was and
must continue to be a perch on the edge of a precipice, from which
any accident might knock him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) headlong. Alice believed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heart
that this last profession or trade to which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had applied himself,
was becoming as nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),--that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) received from it no certain
income;--no income that a man could make to appear respectable to
fathers or guardians when seeking a girl in marriage. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father
declared that all men spoke badly of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Alice knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father to be
an idle man, a man given to pleasure, to be one who thought by far
too much of the good things of the world; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had never found him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
to be either false or malicious. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) unwonted energy in this matter
was in itself evidence that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) believed himself to be right in what
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said.

<p/>To tell the truth, Alice was frightened at what she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had done, and
almost repented of it already. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) acceptance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin's
offer had not come of love;--nor had it, in truth, come chiefly of
ambition. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had not so much asked herself why she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should do this
thing, as why she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should not do it,--seeing that it was required
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) friend. What after all did it matter? That was her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
argument with herself. It cannot be supposed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked back
on the past events of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) life with any self-satisfaction. There was
no self-satisfaction, but in truth there was more self-reproach than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) deserved. As a girl she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin George passionately,
and that love had failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not tell herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
been wrong when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) up, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought herself to have been
most unfortunate in the one necessity. After such an experience as
that, would it not have been better for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to have remained without
further thought of marriage?

<p/>Then came that terrible episode in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) life for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) never could
forgive herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had accepted Mr. Grey because she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) and
honoured him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And I did love him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself, now on this
morning. Poor, wretched, heart-wrung woman! As she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat there thinking
of it all in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) solitude she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was to be pitied at any rate, if not to
be forgiven. Now, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought of Nethercoats, with its quiet life,
its gardens, its books, and the peaceful affectionate ascendancy of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) who would have been her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lord and master, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feelings were very
different from those which had induced her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to resolve that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would
not stoop to put her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neck beneath that yoke. Would it not have been
well for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to have a master who by his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) wisdom and strength could
save her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from such wretched doubtings as these? But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had refused
to bend, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had found herself desolate and alone in the
world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I can do him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) good why should I not marry him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>chief</b></font>)</div>In that feeling
had been the chief argument which had induced her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to return such
an answer as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had sent to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cousin. <div class="bookquote">``For myself, what does it
matter? As to this life of mine and all that belongs to it, why
should I regard it otherwise than to make it of some service to
some one who is dear to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had been ever dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
earliest years. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) believed in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) intellect, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not
believe in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) conduct. Kate, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) friend, longed for this thing. As
for that dream of love, it meant nothing; and as for those arguments
of prudence,--that cold calculation about her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) money, which all people
seemed to expect from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>),--she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would throw it to the winds. What if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) were ruined! There was always the other chance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) might save
him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) from ruin, and help him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) to honour and fortune.

<p/>But then, when the word was once past her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) lips, there returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
that true woman's feeling which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) plead for a long day,--which
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) feel that that long day would be all too short,--which made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) already dread the coming of the end of the year. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had said
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would become George Vavasor's wife, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) wished that the
saying so might be the end of it. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) to embrace
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) how should she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)? The memory of John Grey's last kiss
still lingered on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) lips. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had told herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) scorned the
delights of love; if it were so, was she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) not bound to keep herself
far from them; if it were so,--would not her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cousin's kiss pollute
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It may be as my father says,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``It may be that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wants
my money only; if so, let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) have it. Surely when the year is over
I shall know.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then a plan formed itself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) head, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) did
not make willingly, with any voluntary action of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mind,--but which
came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) as plans do come,--and recommended itself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) in
despite of herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) should have her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) money as he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) might call for
it,--all of it excepting some small portion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) income, which
might suffice to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) from burdening her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) father. Then, if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) were
contented, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should go free, without reproach, and there should be
an end of all question of marriage for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>).

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) thought of this, and matured it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mind, the door opened,
and the servant announced her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cousin George.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXV.

<p/>Passion versus Prudence.


<p/>It had not occurred to Alice that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) accepted lover would come to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) so soon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had not told him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) expressly of the day on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
would return, and had not reflected that Kate would certainly inform
him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had been thinking so much of the distant perils of this
engagement, that this peril, so sure to come upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) before many
days or hours could pass by, had been forgotten. When the name struck
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) ear, and George's step was heard outside on the landing-place,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) felt the blood rush violently to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) heart, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) jumped up
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) seat panic-stricken and in utter dismay. How should she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
receive him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)? And then again, with what form of affection would she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) be
accosted by him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)? But he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was there in the room with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had
had a moment allowed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) for thought.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) hardly ventured to look up at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>); but, nevertheless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) became
aware that there was something in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) appearance and dress brighter,
more lover-like, perhaps newer, than was usual with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). This in
itself was an affliction to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ought to have understood that
such an engagement as theirs not only did not require, but absolutely
forbade, any such symptom of young love as this. Even when their
marriage came, if it must come, it should come without any customary
sign of smartness, without any outward mark of exaltation. It would
have been very good in him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to have remained away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) for weeks
and months; but to come upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) thus, on the first morning of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
return, was a cruelty not to be forgiven. These were the feelings
with which Alice regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) betrothed when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) came to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), coming up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) extended hand,--<div class="bookquote">``Dearest
Alice!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand, and muttered some word which was inaudible
even to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand, and immediately endeavoured to
resume it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) held it clenched within his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) prisoner. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was standing close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) now, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could
not escape from him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was trembling with fear lest worse might
betide her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) even than this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had promised to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
was covered with dismay as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt rather than thought how very far
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was from loving the man to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had given this promise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am a man once again. It is only now that I can
tell you what I have suffered during these last few years.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still
held her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not as yet attempted any closer embrace.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was standing away from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) awkwardly, almost
showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) repugnance to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but it was altogether beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) power
to assume an attitude of ordinary ease. <div class="bookquote">``Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``I
feel that I am a strong man again, armed to meet the world at all
points. Will you not let me thank you for what you have done for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) must speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! Though the doing so should be ever so painful
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) must say some word to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) which should have in it a sound
of kindness. After all, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) undoubted right to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),
and the footing on which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) assumed to stand was simply that which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) herself had given to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It was not his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fault if at this moment
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inspired her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) with disgust rather than with love.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have done nothing for you, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``nothing at all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand away from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and retreated back to a sofa
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) seated herself, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still standing in the space
before the fire. <div class="bookquote">``That you may do much for yourself is my greatest
hope. If I can help you, I will do so most heartily.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
became thoroughly ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) words, feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was at once
offering to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the use of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) purse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you will help me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I am full of plans, all of
which you must share with me. But now, at this moment, my one great
plan is that in which you have already consented to be my partner.
Alice, you are my wife now. Tell me that it will make you happy to
call me your husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Not for worlds could she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) have said so at this moment. It was
ill-judged in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to press her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thus. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should already have seen,
with half an eye, that no such triumph as that which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now demanded
could be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on this occasion. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) triumph when, in the
solitude of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own room, with quiet sarcasm he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had thrown on one
side of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the letter in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as though the
matter had been one almost indifferent to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no right to
expect the double triumph. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had frankly told himself that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
money would be useful to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have been contented with
that conviction, and not have required her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) also to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soft
winning words of love.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That must be still distant, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I have suffered so
much!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And it has been my fault that you have suffered; I know that. These
years of misery have been my doing.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was, however, the year of
coming misery that was the most to be dreaded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``nor have I ever thought it. I have
myself and myself only to blame.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) altogether misunderstood
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), believing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to mean that the fault for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) blamed
herself had been committed in separating herself from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on that
former occasion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice, dear, let bygones be bygones.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bygones will not be bygones. It may be well for people to say so,
but it is never true. One might as well say so to one's body as to
one's heart. But the hairs will grow grey, and the heart will grow
cold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not see that one follows upon the other,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``My hair
is growing very grey;'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and to show that it was so, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lifted the
dark lock from the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) forehead, and displayed the incipient
grizzling of the hair from behind. <div class="bookquote">``If grey hairs make an old man,
Alice, you will marry an old husband; but even you shall not be
allowed to say that my heart is old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>That word <div class="bookquote">``husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>which her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin had twice used, was painful to
Alice's ear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) shrunk from it with palpable bodily suffering. Marry
an old husband! His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) age was nothing to the purpose, though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had
been as old as Enoch. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was again obliged to answer him (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I
spoke of my own heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``I sometimes feel that it has grown
very old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice, that is hardly cheering to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have come to me too quickly, George, and do not reflect how much
there is that I must remember. You have said that bygones should be
bygones. Let them be so, at any rate as far as words are concerned.
Give me a few months in which I may learn,--not to forget them, for
that will be impossible,--but to abstain from speaking of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) look as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) spoke, and in the tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
voice that was very sad. It struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) forcibly, but it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>)
with anger rather than with sadness. Doubtless her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) money had been
his (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) chief object when he (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) offered to renew his (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) engagement with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).
Doubtless he (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) would have made no such offer had she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) been penniless,
or even had his (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) own need been less pressing. But, nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>)
desired something more than money. The triumph of being preferred
to John Grey,--of having John Grey sent altogether adrift, in order
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) old love might be recovered, would have been too costly a
luxury for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) to seek, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) not in seeking it been able to combine
prudence with the luxury. But though his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) prudence had been undoubted,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) desired the luxury also. It was on a calculation of the combined
advantage that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) second offer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) cousin. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
would by no means have consented to proceed with the arrangement
without the benefit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) cousin's money, so also did he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) feel
unwilling to dispense with some expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) love for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), which
would be to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) triumphant. Hitherto in their present interview there
had certainly been no expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) love.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``your greeting to me is hardly all that I had
hoped.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it not?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Indeed, George, I am sorry that you should
be disappointed; but what can I say? You would not have me affect a
lightness of spirit which I do not feel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), very slowly,--<div class="bookquote">``if you wish to retract your
letter to me, you now have my leave to do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>What an opportunity was this of escape! But she (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had not the courage
to accept it. What girl, under such circumstances, would have had
such courage? How often are offers made to us which we would almost
give our eyes to accept, but dare not accept because we fear the
countenance of the offerer? <div class="bookquote">``I do not wish to retract my letter,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), speaking as slowly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had spoken; <div class="bookquote">``but I wish to be left
awhile, that I may recover my strength of mind. Have you not heard
doctors say, that muscles which have been strained, should be allowed
rest, or they will never entirely renew their tension? It is so with
me now; if I could be quiet for a few months, I think I could learn
to face the future with a better courage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is that all you can say to me, Alice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What would you have me say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would fain hear one word of love from you; is that unreasonable?
I would wish to know from your own lips that you have satisfaction in
the renewed prospect of our union; is that too ambitious? It might
have been that I was over-bold in pressing my suit upon you again;
but as you accepted it, have I not a right to expect that you should
show me that you have been happy in accepting it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had not been happy in accepting it. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not happy now
that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had accepted it. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could not show to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) any sign of such
joy as that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) desired to see. And now, at this moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
feared with an excessive fear that there would come some demand for
an outward demonstration of love, such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) position might
have a right to make. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed to be aware that this might be
prevented only by such demeanour on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) part as that which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had
practised, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could not, therefore, be stirred to the expression
of any word of affection. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) listened to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) appeal, and when it was
finished she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) made no reply. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) chose to take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in dudgeon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
must do so. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would make for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) any sacrifice that was possible to
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), but this sacrifice was not possible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have not a word to say to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) asked. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked up at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), and saw that the cicature on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) face was becoming ominous; his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
eyes were bent upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with all their forbidding brilliance, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
was assuming that look of angry audacity which was so peculiar to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), and which had so often cowed those with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was brought in
contact.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No other word, at present, George; I have told you that I am not at
ease. Why do you press me now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) in the breast-pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) coat, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) hand was on it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) might fling it back to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and tell
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would not hold her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) promised wife under such
circumstances as these. The anger which would have induced him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) to do
so was the better part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) nature. Three or four years since, this
better part would have prevailed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would have given way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
rage. But now, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) fingers played upon the paper, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) remembered
that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) money was absolutely essential to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>),--that some of it was
needed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) almost instantly,--that on this very morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was
bound to go where money would be demanded from him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
hopes with regard to Chelsea could not be maintained unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was
able to make some substantial promise of providing funds. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) sister
Kate's fortune was just two thousand pounds. That, and no more, was
now the capital at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) command, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) should abandon this other
source of aid. Even that must go, if all other sources should fail
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would fain have that untouched, if it were possible. Oh,
that that old man in Westmoreland would die and be gathered to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
fathers, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was full of years and ripe for the sickle! But
there was no sign of death about the old man. So his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fingers released
their hold on the letter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) anger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wish me then to go from you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not be angry with me, George!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Angry! I have no right to be angry. But, by heaven, I am wrong
there. I have the right, and I am angry. I think you owed it me to
give me some warmer welcome. Is it to be thus with us always for the
next accursed year?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, George!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To me it will be accursed. But is it to be thus between us always?
Alice, I have loved you above all women. I may say that I have never
loved any woman but you; and yet I am sometimes driven to doubt
whether you have a heart in you capable of love. After all that has
passed, all your old protestations, all my repentance, and your
proffer of forgiveness, you should have received me with open arms.
I suppose I may go now, and feel that I have been kicked out of your
house like a dog.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you speak to me like that, and look at me like that, how can I
answer you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want no answer. I wanted you to put your hand in mine, to kiss me,
and to tell me that you are once more my own. Alice, think better of
it; kiss me, and let me feel my arm once more round your waist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) shuddered as she (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) sat, still silent, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) seat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) shuddered. With all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desire for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) money,--his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) instant need
of it,--this was too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heel, and
left the room without another word. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quick step as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
hurried down the stairs, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) did not rise to arrest him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
heard the door slam as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left the house, but still she (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) did not move
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) seat. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) immediate desire had been that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should go,--and
now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was gone. There was in that a relief which almost comforted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). And this was the man from whom, within the last few days, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
had accepted an offer of marriage.

<p/>George, when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) left the house, walked hurriedly into Cavendish
Square, and down along the east side, till he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) way out along
Princes Street, into the Circus in Oxford Street. Close to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) there,
in Great Marlborough Street, was the house of his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) parliamentary
attorney, Mr. Scruby, on whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) was bound to call on that morning. As
he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) had walked away from Queen Anne Street, he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) had thought of nothing
but that too visible shudder which his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) cousin Alice had been unable
to repress. He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) had been feeding on his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) anger, and indulging it,
telling himself at one moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) would let her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) money
go from him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) whither they list,--and making inward threats in the
next that the time should come in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) would punish her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) for this
ill-usage. But there was the necessity of resolving what he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) would say
to Mr. Scruby. To Mr. Scruby was still due some trifle on the cost of
the last election; but even if this were paid, Mr. Scruby would make
no heavy advance towards the expense of the next election. Whoever
might come out at the end of such affairs without a satisfactory
settlement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) little bill, as had for a while been the case with
Mr. Grimes, from the <div class="bookquote">``Handsome Man,'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimes/Grimes</b></font>)</div>--and as, indeed, still was the
case with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>), as that note of hand at three months' date was not yet
paid,--Mr. Scruby seldom allowed himself to suffer. It was true that
the election would not take place till the summer; but there were
preliminary expenses which needed ready money. Metropolitan voters,
as Mr. Scruby often declared, required to be kept in good humour,--so
that Mr. Scruby wanted the present payment of some five hundred
pounds, and a well-grounded assurance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) would be put in full
funds by the beginning of next June. Even Mr. Scruby might not be true
as perfect steel, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) candidate at the last moment
would not come forth properly prepared. Other candidates, with money
in their pockets, might find their way into Mr. Scruby's offices.
As George Vavasor crossed Regent Street, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) gulped down his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) anger,
and applied his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) mind to business. Should he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) prepare himself to give
orders that Kate's little property should be sold out, or would he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
resolve to use his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) cousin's money? That his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) cousin's money would
still be at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) disposal, in spite of the stormy mood in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had
retreated from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) presence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) felt sure; but the asking for it on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) part would be unpleasant. That duty he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) must entrust to Kate. But
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) reached Mr. Scruby's door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) had decided that for such purposes
as those now in hand, it was preferable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) should use his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) wife's
fortune. It was thus that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) own mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) worded the phrase, and
made for himself an excuse. Yes;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) would use his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) wife's fortune,
and explain to Mr. Scruby that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) would be justified in doing so
by the fact that his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) own heritage would be settled on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
marriage. I do not suppose that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) altogether liked it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) was not,
at any rate as yet, an altogether heartless swindler. He (<font color='blue'><b>swindler</b></font>) could not
take his (<font color='blue'><b>swindler</b></font>) cousin's money without meaning,--without thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>swindler</b></font>)
meant, to repay her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in full all that he (<font color='blue'><b>swindler</b></font>) took. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) behaviour to him (<font color='blue'><b>swindler</b></font>)
this very morning had no doubt made the affair more difficult to
his (<font color='blue'><b>swindler</b></font>) mind, and more unpleasant than it would have been had she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) smiled
on him (<font color='blue'><b>swindler</b></font>); but even as it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>swindler</b></font>) managed to assure himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>swindler</b></font>)
was doing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) no wrong, and with this self-assurance he (<font color='blue'><b>swindler</b></font>) entered Mr.
Scruby's office.

<p/>The clerks in the outer office were very civil to him (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>), and undertook
to promise him (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) should not be kept waiting an instant. There
were four gentlemen in the little parlour, they said, waiting to see
Mr. Scruby, but there they should remain till Mr. Vavasor's interview
was over. One gentleman, as it seemed, was even turned out to make
way for him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>); for as George was ushered into the lawyer's room, a
little man, looking very meek, was hurried away from it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can wait, Smithers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Scruby, speaking from within. <div class="bookquote">``I
shan't be very long.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Vavasor apologized to his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) agent for the injury
he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) was doing Smithers; but Mr. Scruby explained that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) was only a
poor devil of a printer, looking for payment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) little account.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) had printed and posted 30,000 placards for one of the late
Marylebone candidates, and found some difficulty in getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>)
money. <div class="bookquote">``You see, when they're in a small way of business, it ruins
them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Scruby. <div class="bookquote">``Now that poor devil,--he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) hasn't had a shilling
of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) money yet, and the greater part has been paid out of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)
pocket to the posters. It is hard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>It comforted Vavasor when he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) thus heard that there were others who
were more backward in their payments, even than himself, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>)
reflect that a longer credit than had yet been achieved by him (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>), might
perhaps be within his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) reach. <div class="bookquote">``It is astonishing how much a man may
get done for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``without paying anything for years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; that's true. So he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows how to go about it. But
when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does pay, Mr. Vavasor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) does it through the nose;--cent. per
cent., and worse, for all his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) former shortcomings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How many there are who never pay at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. Vavasor;--that's true, too. But see what a life they lead.
It isn't a pleasant thing to be afraid of coming into your agent's
office; not what you would like, Mr. Vavasor;--not if I know you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never was afraid of meeting anyone yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor; <div class="bookquote">``but I
don't know what I may come to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor never will, I'll go bail. But, Lord love you, I could tell
you such tales! I've had Members of Parliament, past, present, and
future, almost down on their knees to me in this little room. It's
about a month or six weeks before the elections come on when they're
at their worst. There is so much you see, Mr. Vavasor, for which a
gentleman must pay ready money. It isn't like a business in which a
lawyer is supposed to find the capital. If I had money enough to pay
out of my own pocket all the cost of all the metropolitan gentlemen
for whom I act, why, I could live on the interest without any
trouble, and go into Parliament myself like a man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>George Vavasor perfectly understood that Mr. Scruby was explaining to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>), with what best attempt at delicacy he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) could make, that funds for
the expense of the Chelsea election were not to be forthcoming from
the Great Marlborough Street establishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But you do do it sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, Mr. Vavasor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Scruby, very solemnly. <div class="bookquote">``As a rule,
never. I may advance the money, on interest, of course, when I
receive a guarantee from the candidate's father, or from six or
seven among the committee, who must all be very substantial,--very
substantial indeed. But in a general way I don't do it. It isn't my
place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you did;--but at any rate I don't want you to do it for
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm quite sure you don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Scruby, with a brighter tone of
voice than that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) had just been using. <div class="bookquote">``I never thought you did, Mr.
Vavasor. Lord bless you, Mr. Vavasor, I know the difference between
gentlemen as soon as I see them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Then they went to business, and Vavasor became aware that it would be
thought convenient that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) should lodge with Mr. Scruby, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) own
account, a sum not less than six hundred pounds within the next week,
and it would be also necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) should provide for taking up
that bill, amounting to ninety-two pounds, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) had given to
the landlord of the <div class="bookquote">``Handsome Man.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>In short, it would be well that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) should borrow a thousand pounds from Alice, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) did not
wish that the family attorney of the Vavasors should be employed
to raise it, he (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) communicated to Mr. Scruby as much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) plans as
was necessary,--feeling more hesitation in doing it than might have
been expected from him (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) had done so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) was very intent on
explaining also that the money taken from his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) cousin, and future
bride, would be repaid to her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) out of the property in Westmoreland,
which was,--did he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) say settled on himself? I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) did.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes;--a family arrangement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Scruby, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>)
congratulated him (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) proposed marriage. Mr. Scruby did not care a
straw from what source the necessary funds might be drawn.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXVI.

<p/>John Grey Goes a Second Time to London.


<p/>Early in that conversation which Mr. Vavasor had with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) daughter,
and which was recorded a few pages back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) implored her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to pause a
while before she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) informed Mr. Grey of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) engagement with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) cousin.
Nothing, however, on that point had been settled between them. Mr.
Vavasor had wished her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would not write till he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) should
have assented to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) doing so. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had declined to bind herself in
this way, and then they had gone off to other things;--to George
Vavasor's character and the disposition of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) money. Alice, however,
had felt herself bound not to write to Mr. Grey quite at once. Indeed,
when her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin left her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had no appetite for writing such a
letter as hers was to be. A day or two passed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in this way, and
nothing more was said by her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father. It was now the middle of
January, and the reader may remember that Mr. Grey had promised that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in London in that month, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) should
know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had returned from Westmoreland. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) must at any rate
do something to prevent that visit. Mr. Grey would not come without
giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) notice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew enough of the habits of the man to be
sure of that. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) desired that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) should be in
time to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>); so when those few days were gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat
down to write without speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father again upon the subject.

<p/>It was a terrible job;--perhaps the most difficult of all the
difficult tasks which her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) adverse fate had imposed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
found when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did attempt it, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could have done it better if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had done it at the moment when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was writing the other letter
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin George. Then Kate had been near her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had been
comforted by Kate's affectionate happiness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had been strengthened
at that moment by a feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was doing the best in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) power,
if not for herself, at any rate for others. All that comfort and
all that strength had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) now. The atmosphere of the fells had
buoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) up, and now the thick air of London depressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
sat for hours with the pen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) hand, and could not write the
letter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) let a day go by and a night, and still it was not written.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) hardly knew herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) unnatural weakness. As the mental
photographs of the two men forced themselves upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) could
not force herself to forget those words--<div class="bookquote">``Look here, upon this
picture--and on this.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>How was it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) now knew how great was
the difference between the two men, how immense the pre-eminence of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had rejected;--and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had not before been able
to see this on any of those many previous occasions on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had
compared the two together? As she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cousin George's face
when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) room a few days since, and remembered Mr. Grey's
countenance when last he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) hand at Cheltenham, the quiet
dignity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) beauty which would submit to show no consciousness
of injury, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) could not but tell herself that when Paradise had
been opened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had declared herself to be fit only for
Pandemonium. In that was her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) chief misery; that now,--now when it was
too late,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) could look at it aright.

<p/>But the letter must be written, and on the second day she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) declared
to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would not rise from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) chair till it was done.
The letter was written on that day and was posted. I will now ask the
reader to go down with me to Nethercoats that we may be present with
John Grey when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) received it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was sitting at breakfast in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
study there, and opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), lounging in an arm-chair, with a
_Quarterly_ in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) hand, was the most intimate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) friends, Frank
Seward, a fellow of the college to which they had both belonged. Mr.
Seward was a clergyman, and the tutor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) college, and a man who
worked very hard at Cambridge. In the days of his (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) leisure he (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) spent
much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) time at Nethercoats, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) was the only man to whom Grey
had told anything of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) love for Alice and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) disappointment.
Even to Seward he (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) had not told the whole story. He (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) had at first
informed his (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) friend that he (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) was engaged to be married, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) had
told this as no secret,--having even said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) hated secrets on
such matters,--the engagement had been mentioned in the common room
of their college, and men at Cambridge knew that Mr. Grey was going
to take to himself a wife. Then Mr. Seward had been told that trouble
had come, and that it was not improbable that there would be no such
marriage. Even when saying this Mr. Grey told none of the particulars,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) owned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) friend that a heavy blow had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
intimacy with Seward was of that thorough kind which is engendered
only out of such young and lasting friendship as had existed between
them; but even to such a friend as this Mr. Grey could not open his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
whole heart. It was only to a friend who should also be his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) wife that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) could do that,--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) himself thoroughly understood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had felt
that such a friend was wanting to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had made the attempt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't speak of this as yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had said to Mr. Seward. <div class="bookquote">``Of course
when the matter is settled, those few people who know me must know
it. But perhaps there may be a doubt as yet, and as long as there is
a doubt, it is better that it should not be discussed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) had said no more than this,--had imputed no blame to Alice,--had
told none of the circumstances; but Seward had known that the girl
had jilted his (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) friend, and had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must be
heartless and false. He (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) had known also that his (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) friend would never
look for any other such companion for his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) home.

<p/>Letters were brought to each of them on this morning, and Seward's
attention was of course occupied by those which he (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) received. Grey,
as soon as the envelopes had touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) hand, became aware that one
of them was from Alice, and this he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) at once opened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) did it very
calmly, but without any of that bravado of indifference with which
George Vavasor had received Alice's letter from Westmoreland. <div class="bookquote">``It is
right that I should tell you at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, rushing into the
middle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) subject without even the formality of the customary
address--<div class="bookquote">``It is right that I should tell you at once that--.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Oh,
the difficulty which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had encountered when her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) words had carried
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) as far as this!--<div class="bookquote">``that my cousin, George Vavasor, has repeated
to me his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) offer of marriage, and that I have accepted it. I tell
you, chiefly in order that I may save you from the trouble which you
purposed to take when I last saw you at Cheltenham. I will not tell
you any of the circumstances of this engagement, because I have no
right to presume that you will care to hear them. I hardly dare
to ask you to believe of me that in all that I have done, I have
endeavoured to act with truth and honesty. That I have been very
ignorant, foolish,--what you will that is bad, I know well; otherwise
there could not have been so much in the last few years of my life
on which I am utterly ashamed to look back. For the injury that I
have done you, I can only express deep contrition. I do not dare to
ask you to forgive me.--ALICE VAVASOR.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had tormented herself in
writing this,--had so nearly driven herself distracted with attempts
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had destroyed, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would not even read once to herself
these last words. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll know it, and that is all that is necessary,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sent the letter away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).

<p/>Mr. Grey read it twice over, leaving the other letters unnoticed on
the table by his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) tea-cup. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) read it twice over, and the work of
reading it was one to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) of intense agony. Hitherto he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had fed
himself with hope. That Alice should have been brought to think of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) engagement with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) in a spirit of doubt and with a mind so
troubled, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been inclined to attempt an escape from it,
had been very grievous to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>); but it had been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) mind a fantasy,
a morbid fear of himself, which might be cured by time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), at any
rate, would give all his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) energies towards achieving such a cure.
There had been one thing, however, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) most feared;--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
had chiefly feared, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had forbidden himself to think that it
could be probable, and this thing had now happened.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had ever disliked and feared George Vavasor;--not from any effect
which the man had upon himself, for as we know his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) acquaintance with
Vavasor was of the slightest;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had feared and disliked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
influence upon Alice. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had also feared the influence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin
Kate. To have cautioned Alice against her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousins would have been to
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) impossible. It was not his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nature to express suspicion to one he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
loved. Is the tone of that letter remembered in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had answered
Alice when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) informed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin George was to go with
Kate and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) to Switzerland? He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had written, with a pleasant joke,
words which Alice had been able to read with some little feeling of
triumph to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) two friends. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had not so written because he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) liked
what he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) knew of the man. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) disliked all that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) knew of him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). But it
had not been possible for him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) distrusted the prudence
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), whom, as his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) future wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was prepared to trust in all
things.

<p/>I have said that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) read Alice's letter with an agony of sorrow; as
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sat with it in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) suffered as, probably, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had never
suffered before. But there was nothing in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) countenance to show
that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was in pain. Seward had received some long epistle, crossed
from end to end,--indicative, I should say, of a not far distant
termination to that college tutorship,--and was reading it with
placid contentment. It did not occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) to look across at Grey,
but had he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) done so, I doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would have seen anything to
attract his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) attention. But Grey, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was wounded, would not
allow himself to be dismayed. There was less hope now than before,
but there might still be hope;--hope for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), even though there might
be none for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). Tidings had reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) ears also as to George
Vavasor, which had taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) to believe that the man was needy,
reckless, and on the brink of ruin. Such a marriage to Alice Vavasor
would be altogether ruinous. Whatever might be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own ultimate fate
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would still seek to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) from that. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) cousin, doubtless,
wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) money. Might it not be possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would be satisfied
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) money, and that thus the woman might be saved?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seward,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said at last, addressing his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) friend, who had not yet
come to the end of the last crossed page.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there anything wrong?''  (<font color='red'><b>Seward/Mr. Seward</b></font>)</div>said Seward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--yes; there is something a little wrong. I fear I must leave
you, and go up to town to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody ill, I hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--nobody is ill. But I must go up to London. Mrs. Bole will take
care of you, and you must not be angry with me for leaving you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Seward/Mr. Seward</b></font>)</div><p/>Seward assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) would not be in the least angry, and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) was thoroughly conversant with the capabilities and good
intentions of Mrs. Bole the housekeeper; but added, that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) was
so near his (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) own college, he (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) would of course go back to Cambridge.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) longed to say some word as to the purpose of Grey's threatened
journey; to make some inquiry as to this new trouble; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) knew
that Grey was a man who did not well bear close inquiries, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was
silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not stay here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey, after a minute's pause. <div class="bookquote">``I wish
you would, old fellow; I do, indeed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Seward/Mr. Seward</b></font>)</div>There was a tone of special
affection in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) voice which struck Seward at once. <div class="bookquote">``If I can be of
the slightest service or comfort to you, I will of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div><p/>Grey again sat silent for a little while. <div class="bookquote">``I wish you would; I do,
indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I will.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And again there was a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have got a letter here from--Miss Vavasor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I hope that--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--it does not bring good news to me. I do not know that I can
tell it you all. I would if I could, but the whole story is one not
to be told in a hurry. I should leave false impressions. There are
things which a man cannot tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed there are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seward/Mr. Seward</b></font>)</div>said Seward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish with all my heart that you knew it all as I know it; but that
is impossible. There are things which happen in a day which it would
take a lifetime to explain.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then there was another pause. <div class="bookquote">``I have
heard bad news this morning, and I must go up to London at once. I
shall go into Ely so as to be there by twelve; and if you will, you
shall drive me over. I may be back in a day; certainly in less than
a week; but it will be a comfort to me to know that I shall find you
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The matter was so arranged, and at eleven they started. During
the first two miles not a word was spoken between them. <div class="bookquote">``Seward,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>Grey said at last, <div class="bookquote">``if I fail in what I am going to attempt, it is
probable that you will never hear Alice Vavasor's name mentioned by
me again; but I want you always to bear this in mind;--that at no
moment has my opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) ever been changed, nor must you in such
case imagine from my silence that it has changed. Do you understand
me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To my thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) is the finest of God's creatures that I have
known. It may be that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) future life she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) will be severed from me
altogether; but I shall not, therefore, think the less well of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>);
and I wish that you, as my friend, should know that I so esteem her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>),
even though her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) name should never be mentioned between us.''  (<font color='red'><b>Seward/Mr. Seward</b></font>)</div>Seward,
in some few words, assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Seward</b></font>) that it should be so, and then they
finished their journey in silence.

<p/>From the station at Ely, Grey sent a message by the wires up to John
Vavasor, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would call on him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) that afternoon at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
office in Chancery Lane. The chances were always much against finding
Mr. Vavasor at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) office; but on this occasion the telegram did reach
him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) remained till the unaccustomed hour of half past
four to meet the man who was to have been his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son-in-law.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked as soon as Grey entered the dingy
little room, not in Chancery Lane, but in its neighbourhood, which
was allocated to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) signing purposes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>--said Grey; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) has written to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And told you about her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) cousin George. I tried to hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) from
writing, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) is very wilful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you have hindered her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)? If the thing was to be told, it is
better that it should be done at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I hoped that there might be an escape. I don't know what you
think of all this, Grey, but to me it is the bitterest misfortune
that I have known. And I've had some bitter things, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
added,--thinking of that period of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) life, when the work of which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was ashamed was first ordained as his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) future task.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the escape that you hoped?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>asked Grey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hardly know. The whole thing seems to me to be so mad, that I
partly trusted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would see the madness of it. I am not sure
whether you know anything of my nephew George?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Vavasor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very little,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to be utterly an adventurer,--a man without means and
without principle,--upon the whole about as bad a man as you may
meet. I give you my word, Grey, that I don't think I know a worse
man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)'s going to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) money; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) will beggar her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>),
after that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)'ll ill-treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>), and yet what can I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Prevent the marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how, my dear fellow? Prevent it! It's all very well to say that,
and it's the very thing I want to do. But how am I to prevent it?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)'s as much her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) own master as you are yours. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) can give him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) every
shilling of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) fortune to-morrow. How am I to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) from
marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) give him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) every shilling of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) fortune to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said
Grey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) to do then?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Vavasor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then--then,--then,--then let her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) come to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said John Grey; and as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) spoke there was the fragment of a tear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) eye, and the hint of
quiver in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) voice.

<p/>Even the worldly, worn-out, unsympathetic nature of John Vavasor was
struck, and, as it were, warmed by this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you; God bless you, my dear fellow. I heartily wish
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) sake that I could look forward to any such an end to this
affair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why not look forward to it? You say that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) merely wants her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
money. As he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wants it let him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) have it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Grey, you do not know Alice; you do not understand my girl. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) fortune nothing would induce her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to become your
wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave that to follow as it may,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said John Grey. <div class="bookquote">``Our first object
must be to sever her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) from a man, who is, as you say, himself on the
verge of ruin; and who would certainly make her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wretched. I am here
now, not because I wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to be my own wife, but because I wish
that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should not become the wife of such a one as your nephew. If
I were you I would let him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) have her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you were I, you would have nothing more to do with it than the
man that is as yet unborn. I know that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) money
because she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has said so; but I have no power as to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) giving it or
as to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) withholding it. That's the hardship of my position;--but it
is of no use to think of that now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div><p/>John Grey certainly did not think about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) knew well that Alice
was independent, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was not inclined to give up that
independence to anyone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had not expected that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father would
be able to do much towards hindering his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) daughter from becoming the
wife of George Vavasor, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) himself and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
father should be in accord in their views, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) found that this
was so. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) left Mr. Vavasor's room nothing had been said about
the period of the marriage. Grey thought it improbable that Alice
would find herself able to give herself in marriage to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin
immediately,--so soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) breach with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>); but as to this he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
had no assurance, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) determined to have the facts from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own
lips, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would see him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). So he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), naming a day on which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would call upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) early in the morning; and having received
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) no prohibition, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was in Queen Anne Street at the hour
appointed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had conceived a scheme which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had not made known to Mr. Vavasor,
and as to the practicability of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had much doubt; but which,
nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was resolved to try if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) should find the attempt
possible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) himself would buy off George Vavasor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had ever been a
prudent man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had money at command. If Vavasor was such a man
as they, who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best, represented him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), such a purchase might be
possible. But then, before this was attempted, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be quite sure
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must satisfy himself also that in doing
so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not, in truth, add to Alice's misery. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hardly
bring himself to think it possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did, in truth, love her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
cousin with passionate love. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) remembered what
Alice had been to himself, that this must be impossible. But if it
were so, that of course must put an end to his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) interference. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
thought that if he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) might learn all this, and therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
went to Queen Anne Street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must come if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) said to herself when she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)
received his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) note. <div class="bookquote">``It can make no matter. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will say nothing half
so hard to me as what I say to myself all day long.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>But when the
morning came, and the hour came, and the knock at the door for which
her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) ears were on the alert, her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) heart misgave her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) felt that
the present moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) punishment, though not the heaviest, would
still be hard to bear.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) came slowly up-stairs,--his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) step was ever slow,--and gently opened
the door for himself. Then, before he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) even looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) closed
it again. I do not know how to explain that it was so; but it was
this perfect command of himself at all seasons which had in part made
Alice afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), and drove her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to believe that they were not
fitted for each other. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) thus turned for a moment from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and then walked slowly towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), stood with both her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hands
leaning on the centre table of the room, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes fixed upon
its surface.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said, walking up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) very slowly.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) whole frame shuddered as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heard the sweetness of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) voice.
Had I not better tell the truth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) at once? Oh, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could only
have been his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) again! What madness during these last six months had
driven her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to such a plight as this! The old love came back upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). Nay; it had never gone. But that trust in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) love returned to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),--that trust which told her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that such love and such worth would
have sufficed to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) happy. But this confidence in him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was
worthless now! Even though he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) should desire it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not change
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said again. And then, as slowly she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``You may give it me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``as to an old
friend.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) hand, and then, withdrawing it, felt
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) must never trust herself to do so again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``I do not expect you to say much to me; but
there is a question or two which I think you will answer. Has a day
been fixed for this marriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will it be in a month?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no;--not for a year,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) replied hurriedly;--and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) knew at
once by her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) voice that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) already dreaded this new wedlock. Whatever
of anger he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) might before have felt for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was banished. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
brought herself by her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ill-judgement,--by her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ignorance, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
confessed,--to a sad pass; but he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was still worthy
of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) love.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now one other question, Alice;--but if you are silent, I will
not ask it again. Can you tell me why you have again accepted your
cousin's offer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because--,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said very quickly, looking up as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) were
about to speak with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) old courage. <div class="bookquote">``But you would never
understand me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said,--<div class="bookquote">``and there can be no reason why I should
dare to hope that you should ever think well of me again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) knew that there was no love,--no love for that man to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had pledged her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not know, on the other hand, how strong,
how unchanged, how true was her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) love for himself. Indeed, of himself
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was thinking not at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desired to learn whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would
suffer, if by any scheme he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might succeed in breaking off this
marriage. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) were to be married at
once, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had shuddered at the thought. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) why she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had accepted her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had faltered, and hinted at some excuse
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might fail to understand. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) loved George Vavasor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
could have understood that well enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) said, speaking still very slowly, <div class="bookquote">``nothing has ever yet

But, Alice,--and I think that the position in which we stood a few
months since justifies me in saying so without offence,--I love you
now as well as ever, and should things change with you, I cannot tell
you with how much joy and eagerness I should take you back to my
bosom. My heart is yours now as it has been since I knew you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) again just touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been
able to answer a word.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXVII.

<p/>Mr. Tombe's Advice.


<p/>Alice sat alone for an hour without moving when John Grey had left
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and the last words which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had uttered were sounding in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
ears all the time, <div class="bookquote">``My heart is still yours, as it has been since I
knew you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>There had been something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) words which had soothed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) spirits, and had, for the moment, almost comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). At any
rate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) did not despise her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) could not have spoken such words as
these to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) not still held her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) high in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) esteem. Nay;--had
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) not even declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would yet take her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) own if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
would come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)? <div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell you with how much joy I would take
you back to my bosom!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Ah! that might never be. But yet the assurance
had been sweet to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>);--dangerously sweet, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) soon told herself.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) Eden, but it was something to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that
the master of the garden had not himself driven her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) forth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat
there, thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) fate, as though it belonged to some other
one,--not to herself; as though it were a tale that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had read.
Herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had shipwrecked altogether; but though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might sink,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had not been thrust from the ship by hands which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) loved.

<p/>But would it not have been better that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) should have scorned her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
and reviled her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) been able to do so, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) at least would have
escaped the grief of disappointed love. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) learned to despise
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would have ceased to regret her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had no right to feel
consolation in the fact that his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sufferings were equal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own.
But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought of this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) told herself that it could not be
that it was so. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was a man, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, not passionate by nature.
Alas! it was the mistake she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had ever made when summing up the items
of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) character! He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) might be persistent, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought, in still
striving to do that upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had once resolved. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had said
so, and that which he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said was always true to the letter. But,
nevertheless, when this thing which he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) still chose to pursue should
have been put absolutely beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) reach, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would not allow his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
calm bosom to be harassed by a vain regret. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was a man too whole at
every point,--so Alice told herself,--to allow his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) happiness to be
marred by such an accident.

<p/>But must the accident occur? Was there no chance that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) might be
saved, even from such trouble as might follow upon such a loss?
Could it not be possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) might be gratified,--since it would
gratify him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>),--and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might be saved! Over and over again she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
considered this,--but always as though it were another woman whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
would fain save, and not herself.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own fate was fixed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been mad when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had done the thing, but the thing was not on that account the less
done. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been mad when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had trusted herself abroad with
two persons, both of whom, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had well known, were intent on
wrenching her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) happiness from out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) grasp. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been mad when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had told herself, whilst walking over the Westmoreland fells,
that after all she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might as well marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin, since that other
marriage was then beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) reach! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) two cousins had succeeded in
blighting all the hopes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) life;--but what could she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) now think
of herself in that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been so weak as to submit to such usage
from their hands? Alas!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) told herself, admitting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) misery
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) weakness,--alas, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had no mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had gloried in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
independence, and this had come of it! She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had scorned the prudence
of Lady Macleod, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) scorn had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) to this pass!

<p/>Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) to give herself bodily,--body and soul, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) said aloud in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) solitary agony,--to a man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) did not love? Must she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) submit
to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) caresses,--lie on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bosom,--turn herself warmly to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
kisses? <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``no,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--speaking audibly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) walked about
the room; <div class="bookquote">``no;--it was not in my bargain; I never meant it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But if
so what had she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) meant;--what had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) dream? Of what marriage had
she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) thought, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) was writing that letter back to George Vavasor?
How am I to analyse her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) mind, and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) thoughts and feelings
intelligible to those who may care to trouble themselves with the
study? Any sacrifice she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) would make for her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) cousin which one friend
could make for another. She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) would fight his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) battles with her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) money,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) words, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) sympathy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) would sit with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
needed it, and speak comfort to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) by the hour. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) disgrace should
be her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) disgrace;--his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) glory her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) glory;--his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pursuits her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) pursuits.
Was not that the marriage to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had consented? But he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had come
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) for a kiss, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had shuddered before him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>),
when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) made the demand. Then that other one had come and had touched
her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) hand, and the fibres of her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) body had seemed to melt within her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) at
the touch, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) could have fallen at his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) feet.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had done very wrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had done wrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) knew
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had sinned with that sin which specially disgraces a woman.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) would become the wife of a man to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>)
could not cleave with a wife's love; and, mad with a vile ambition,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had given up the man for whose modest love her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) heart was longing.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had thrown off from her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) that wondrous aroma of precious delicacy,
which is the greatest treasure of womanhood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had sinned against
her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) sex; and, in an agony of despair, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) crouched down upon the
floor with her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) head against her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) chair, she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) told herself that there
was no pardon for her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) understood it now, and knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) could
not forgive herself.

<p/>But can you forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>), delicate reader? Or am I asking the question
too early in my story? For myself, I have forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>). The story of
the struggle has been present to my mind for many years,--and I have
learned to think that even this offence against womanhood may, with
deep repentance, be forgiven. And you also must forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) before we
close the book, or else my story will have been told amiss.

<p/>But let us own that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had sinned,--almost damnably, almost past
forgiveness. What;--think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) knew what love meant, and not know
which of two she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) loved! What;--doubt, of two men for whose arms she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>)
longed, of which the kisses would be sweet to bear; on which side lay
the modesty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) maiden love! Faugh! She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had submitted to pollution
of heart and feeling before she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had brought herself to such a pass as
this. Come;--let us see if it be possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) may be cleansed by
the fire of her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) sorrow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) passed that whole day in asking herself that
question. She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) was herself astounded at the rapidity with which the
conviction had forced itself upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) that a marriage with her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) cousin
would be to her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) almost impossible; and could she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) permit it to be
said of her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had thrice in her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) career jilted a promised
suitor,--that three times she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) would go back from her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) word because
her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) fancy had changed? Where could she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) find the courage to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>)
father, to tell Kate, to tell even George himself, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) purpose
was again altered? But she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had a year at her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) disposal. If only during
that year he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) money and squander it, and then require
nothing further of her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) hands, might she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) not thus escape the doom
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>)? Might it not be possible that the refusal should this
time come from him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)? But she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) succeeded in making one resolve. She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>)
thought at least that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) succeeded. Come what might, she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) would never
stand with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) at the altar. While there was a cliff from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>)
might fall, water that would cover her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>), a death-dealing grain that
might be mixed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) cup, she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) could not submit herself to be George
Vavasor's wife. To no ear could she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) tell of this resolve. To no
friend could she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) hint her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) purpose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) owed her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) money to the man
after what had passed between them. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right to count upon
such assistance as that would give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have it. Only
as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) betrothed she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) could give it him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) understood well that
if there were any breach between them, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) accepting of such aid
would be impossible. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) money, and then, when the day
came, some escape should be found.

<p/>In the afternoon her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) father came to her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>), and it may be as well to
explain that Mr. Grey had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) again that day. Mr. Grey, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) left Queen Anne Street, had gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) lawyer, and from thence
had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) way to Mr. Vavasor. It was between five and six when
Mr. Vavasor came back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) then found his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) daughter
sitting over the drawing-room fire, without lights, in the gloom
of the evening. Mr. Vavasor had returned with Grey to the lawyer's
chambers, and had from thence come direct to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) own house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had
been startled at the precision with which all the circumstances
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) daughter's position had been explained to a mild-eyed old
gentleman, with a bald head, who carried on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) business in a narrow,
dark, clean street, behind Doctors' Commons. Mr. Tombe was his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) name.
<div class="bookquote">``No;''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>Mr. Grey had said, when Mr. Vavasor had asked as to the peculiar
nature of Mr. Tombe's business; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) is not specially an ecclesiastical
lawyer. He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had a partner at Ely, and was always employed by my
father, and by most of the clergy there.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tombe</b></font>)</div>Mr. Tombe had evinced no
surprise, no dismay, and certainly no mock delicacy, when the whole
affair was under discussion. George Vavasor was to get present
moneys, but,--if it could be so arranged--from John Grey's stores
rather than from those belonging to Alice. Mr. Tombe could probably
arrange that with Mr. Vavasor's lawyer, who would no doubt be able to
make difficulty as to raising ready money. Mr. Tombe would be able
to raise ready money without difficulty. And then, at last, George
Vavasor was to be made to surrender his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) bride, taking or having taken
the price of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) bargain. John Vavasor sat by in silence as the
arrangement was being made, not knowing how to speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had no money
with which to give assistance. <div class="bookquote">``I wish you to understand from the
lady's father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>Grey said to the lawyer, <div class="bookquote">``that the marriage would be
regarded by him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with as much dismay as by myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly;--it would be ruinous,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Mr. Vavasor had answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you see, Mr. Tombe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>Mr. Grey went on, <div class="bookquote">``we only wish to try the
man. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) be not such as we believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) to be, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) can prove it by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) conduct. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) is worthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) can then take her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You merely wish to open her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes, Mr. Grey,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said the mild-eyed
lawyer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) should have what money he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) wants, and then we shall
find what it is he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) really wishes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; we shall know our man,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said the lawyer. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) shall have the
money, Mr. Grey,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>and so the interview had been ended.

<p/>Mr. Vavasor, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) entered the drawing-room, addressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) daughter
in a cheery voice. <div class="bookquote">``What; all in the dark?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, papa. Why should I have candles when I am doing nothing? I did
not expect you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I suppose not. I came here because I want to say a few words to
you about business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What business, papa?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice well understood the tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father's
voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was desirous of propitiating her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>); but was at the same time
desirous of carrying some point in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) thought it probable that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would oppose him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; my love, if I understood you rightly, your cousin George wants
some money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not say that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wants it now; but I think he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will want it
before the time for the election comes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If so, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will want it at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has not asked you for it yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has merely said that should he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) be in need he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would take me at
my word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think there is no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wants it. Indeed, I believe that
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is almost entirely without present means of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can hardly think so; but I have no knowledge about it. I can only
say that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has not asked me yet, and that I should wish to oblige

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To what extent, Alice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what I have. I get about four hundred a year, but I
do not know what it is worth, or how far it can all be turned into
money. I should wish to keep a hundred a year and let him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) have the
rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What; eight thousand pounds!''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the father who in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
wish not to oppose her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), could not but express his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dismay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not imagine that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will want so much; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) should, I wish
that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) should have it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven and earth!''  (<font color='red'><b>John Vavasor/Mr. John Vavasor/Mr. Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said John Vavasor. <div class="bookquote">``Of course we should have to
give up the house.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) could not suppress his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) trouble, or refrain
from bursting out in agony at the prospect of such a loss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has asked me for nothing yet, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, exactly; and perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) may not; but I wish to know what to do
when the demand is made. I am not going to oppose you now; your money

would you gratify me in one thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, papa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) does apply, let the amount be raised through me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come to me; I mean, so that I may see the lawyer, and have the
arrangements made.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that in dealing with
large sums of money, it could not be right that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should do so
without his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) knowledge, even though the property was her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own. <div class="bookquote">``I will
promise you that I will not oppose your wishes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) said. Then Alice
undertook that when such case should arise the money should be raised
through his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) means.

<p/>The day but one following this she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) received a letter from Lady
Glencora, who was still at Matching Priory. It was a light-spirited,
chatty, amusing letter, intended to be happy in its tone,--intended
to have a flavour of happiness, but just failing through the too
apparent meaning of a word here and there. <div class="bookquote">``You will see that I am at
Matching,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the letter said, <div class="bookquote">``whereas you will remember that I was to
have been at Monkshade. I escaped at last by a violent effort, and
am now passing my time innocently,--I fear not so profitably as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
would induce me to do,--with Iphy Palliser. You remember Iphy. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is
a good creature, and would fain turn even me to profit, if it were
possible. I own that I am thinking of them all at Monkshade, and
am in truth delighted that I am not there. My absence is entirely
laid upon your shoulders. That wicked evening amidst the ruins! Poor
ruins. I go there alone sometimes and fancy that I hear such voices
from the walls, and see such faces through the broken windows! All
the old Pallisers come and frown at me, and tell me that I am not
good enough to belong to them. There is a particular window to which
Sir Guy comes and makes faces at me. I told Iphy the other day, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) answered me very gravely, that I might, if I chose, make myself
good enough for the Pallisers. Even for the Pallisers! Isn't that
beautiful?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Lady Glencora went on to say, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband intended to come
up to London early in the session, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``That is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>added Lady Glencora, <div class="bookquote">``if I am still good enough for the

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXXVIII.

<p/>The Inn at Shap.


<p/>When George Vavasor left Mr. Scruby's office--the attentive reader
will remember that he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) did call upon Mr. Scruby, the Parliamentary
lawyer, and there recognised the necessity of putting himself
in possession of a small sum of money with as little delay as
possible;--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) left the attorney's office, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) was well aware that
the work to be done was still before him (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) knew also that the
job to be undertaken was a very disagreeable job. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) did not like the
task of borrowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) cousin Alice's money.

<p/>We all of us know that swindlers and rogues do very dirty tricks,
and we are apt to picture to ourselves a certain amount of gusto
and delight on the part of the swindlers in the doing of them. In
this, I think we are wrong. The poor, broken, semi-genteel beggar,
who borrows half-sovereigns apiece from all his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) old acquaintances,
knowing that they know that he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) will never repay them, suffers a
separate little agony with each petition that he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) makes. He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) does not
enjoy pleasant sailing in this journey which he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) is making. To be
refused is painful to him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>). To get his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) half sovereign with scorn is
painful. To get it with apparent confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) honour is almost
more painful. <div class="bookquote">``D-- it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) says to himself on such rare occasions,
<div class="bookquote">``I will pay that fellow;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and yet, as he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) says it, he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)
never will pay even that fellow. It is a comfortless unsatisfying
trade, that of living upon other people's money.

<p/>How was George Vavasor to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) first step towards getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) cousin's purse? He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) asking for her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
love, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had shuddered when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). That had been the
commencement of their life under their new engagement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) knew very
well that the money would be forthcoming when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) demanded it,--but
under their present joint circumstances, how was he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) to make the
demand? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), should he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) simply ask for money, and make
no allusion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) love? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) in person, should he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) make
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) visit a mere visit of business,--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) might call on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) banker?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) resolved at last that Kate should do the work for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>). Indeed,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had felt all along that it would be well that Kate should act as
ambassador between him (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) and Alice in money matters, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had long
done in other things. He (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) could talk to Kate as he (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) could not talk to
Alice;--and then, between the women, those hard money necessities
would be softened down by a romantic phraseology which he (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) would not
himself know how to use with any effect. He (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) mind to see
Kate, and with this view he (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) went down to Westmoreland; and took
himself to a small wayside inn at Shap among the fells, which had
been known to him (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) of old. He (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) sister notice that he (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) would be
there, and begged her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to come over to him (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) as early as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) might find
it possible on the morning after his (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) arrival. He (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) himself reached the
place late in the evening by train from London. There is a station
at Shap, by which the railway company no doubt conceives that it
has conferred on that somewhat rough and remote locality all the
advantages of a refined civilization; but I doubt whether the
Shappites have been thankful for the favour. The landlord at the inn,
for one, is not thankful. Shap had been a place owing all such life
as it had possessed to coaching and posting. It had been a stage on
the high road from Lancaster to Carlisle, and though it lay high
and bleak among the fells, and was a cold, windy, thinly-populated
place,--filling all travellers with thankfulness that they had not
been made Shappites, nevertheless, it had had its glory in its
coaching and posting. I have no doubt that there are men and women
who look back with a fond regret to the palmy days of Shap.

<p/>Vavasor reached the little inn about nine in the evening on a night
that was pitchy dark, and in a wind which made it necessary for him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hat on to his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``What a beastly country to live in,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said to himself, resolving that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would certainly sell Vavasor
Hall in spite of all family associations, if ever the power to do so
should be his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What trash it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``hanging on to such a
place as that without the means of living like a gentleman, simply
because one's ancestors have done so.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) expressed a
doubt to himself whether all the world contained a more ignorant,
opinionated, useless old man than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grandfather,--or, in short, a
greater fool.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mr. George,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the landlord as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``a sight
of you's guid for sair een. It's o'er lang since you've been doon
amang the fells.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>But George did not want to converse with the
innkeeper, or to explain how it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did not visit Vavasor
Hall. The innkeeper, no doubt, knew all about it,--knew that the
grandfather had quarrelled with his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) grandson, and knew the reason
why; but George, if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) suspected such knowledge, did not choose to
refer to it. So he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) simply grunted something in reply, and getting
himself in before a spark of fire which hardly was burning in a
public room with a sandy floor, begged that the little sitting-room
up-stairs might be got ready for him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). There he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) passed the evening in
solitude, giving no encouragement to the landlord, who, nevertheless,
looked him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) up three or four times,--till at last George said that his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
head ached, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would wish to be alone. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was always one of
them cankery chiels as never have a kindly word for man nor beast,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the landlord. <div class="bookquote">``Seems as though that raw slash in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face had
gone right through into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart.''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>After that George was left alone,
and sat thinking whether it would not be better to ask Alice for two
thousand pounds at once,--so as to save him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) from the disagreeable
necessity of a second borrowing before their marriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was very
uneasy in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had flattered himself through it all that his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
cousin had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had felt sure that such was the case while
they were together in Switzerland. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had determined to give
up John Grey, of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had told himself the same thing. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had at once answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) first subsequent overture with an assent, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
had of course been certain that it was so. Dark, selfish, and even
dishonest as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had, nevertheless, enjoyed something of a
lover's true pleasure in believing that Alice had still loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
through all their mischances. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) joy had in a moment been turned
into gall during that interview in Queen Anne Street. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had read the
truth at a glance. A man must be very vain, or else very little used
to such matters, who at George Vavasor's age cannot understand the
feelings with which a woman receives him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>). When Alice contrived as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had done to escape the embrace he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was so well justified in asking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
knew the whole truth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was sore at heart, and very angry withal.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) could have readily spurned her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) from him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>), and rejected her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) who had
once rejected him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would have done so had not his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) need for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
money restrained him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was not a man who could deceive himself in
such matters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) knew that this was so, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) told himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
was a rascal.

<p/>Vavasor Hall was, by the road, about five miles from Shap, and it
was not altogether an easy task for Kate to get over to the village
without informing her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) grandfather that the visit was to be made, and
what was its purport. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) could, indeed, walk, and the walk would not
be so long as that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had taken with Alice to Swindale fell;--but
walking to an inn on a high road, is not the same thing as walking
to a point on a hill side over a lake. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) been dirty, draggled,
and wet through on Swindale fell, it would have simply been matter
for mirth; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) brother she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew would not have liked to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
enter the Lowther Arms at Shap in such a condition. It, therefore,
became necessary that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) grandfather to lend her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) the
jaunting car.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where do you want to go?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) asked sharply. In such establishments
as that at Vavasor Hall the family horse is generally used for double
duties. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) draws the lady of the house one day, he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) is not too
proud to draw manure on the next. And it will always be found that
the master of the house gives a great preference to the manure over
the lady. The squire at Vavasor had come to do so to such an extent
that he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) regarded any application for the animal's services as an
encroachment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only to Shap, grandpapa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Shap! what on earth can take you to Shap? There are no shops at
Shap.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not going to do shopping. I want to see some one there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whom can you want to see at Shap?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Then it occurred to Kate on the spur of the moment that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) might as
well tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) grandfather the fact. <div class="bookquote">``My brother has come down,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
said; <div class="bookquote">``and is at the inn there. I had not intended to tell you, as
I did not wish to mention his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) name till you had consented to receive
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) expects to come here now;--does he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the squire</b></font>)</div>said the squire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, sir. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has no expectation of the kind. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has come
down simply to see me;--about business I believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Business! what business? I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wants to get your money from
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it is with reference to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) marriage. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wants me to
use my influence with Alice that it may not be delayed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, Kate; if ever you lend him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) your money, or any of
it,--that is, of the principal I mean,--I will never speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>)
again under any circumstance. And more than that! Look here, Kate. In
spite of all that has past and gone, the property will become his (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) for
his (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) life when I die,--unless I change my will. If he (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) gets your money
from you, I will change it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) shall not be a shilling richer at
my death than he (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) is now. You can have the horse to go to Shap.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the squire</b></font>)</div><p/>What unlucky chance had it been which had put this idea into the old
squire's head on this especial morning? Kate had resolved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
would entreat her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother to make use of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) little fortune. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
feared that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was now coming with some reference to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) cousin's
money,--that something was to be done to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to avail himself
of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) cousin's offer; and Kate, almost blushing in the solitude of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) chamber at the thought, was determined that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother must be
saved from such temptation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) knew that money was necessary to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could not stand a second contest without assistance.
With all their confidences, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had never told her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) much of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
pecuniary circumstances in the world, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was almost sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
was a poor man. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had said as much as that to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), and in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) letter
desiring her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) at Shap, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had inserted a word or two
purposely intended to prepare her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mind for monetary considerations.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was jogged along over the rough road to Shap, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) made up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mind that Aunt Greenow would be the proper person to defray
the expense of the coming election. To give Kate her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) due she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would
have given up every shilling of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) own money without a moment's
hesitation, or any feeling that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother would be wrong to accept
it. Nor would she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), perhaps, have been unalterably opposed to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
taking Alice's money, had Alice simply been his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) cousin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt that
as Vavasors they were bound to stand by the future head of the family
in an attempt which was to be made, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt, for the general
Vavasor interest. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not endure to think that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) brother
should take the money of the girl whom he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was engaged to marry. Aunt
Greenow's money she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) thought was fair game. Aunt Greenow herself had
made various liberal offers to herself which Kate had declined, not
caring to be under pecuniary obligations even to Aunt Greenow without
necessity; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) felt that for such a purpose as her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) brother's
contest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) need not hesitate to ask for assistance, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) thought
also that such assistance would be forthcoming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Grandpapa knows that you are here, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, when their
first greeting was over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The deuce he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) does! and why did you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could not get the car to come in without letting him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) know why I
wanted it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What nonsense! as if you couldn't have made any excuse! I was
particularly anxious that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) should not guess that I am here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see that it can make any difference, George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I see that it can,--a very great difference. It may prevent my
ever being able to get near him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) again before he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) dies. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) say
about my coming?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) didn't say much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not have gone if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had. I don't know now that I ever

will, and leave me in the position which I have a right to expect,
would take more time than the whole property is worth. And he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would
endeavour to tie me down in some way I could not stand;--perhaps ask
me to give up my notion for going into Parliament.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I did, George, when I wrote to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you? well; I had forgotten. I don't know that any very strong
congratulatory tone is necessary. As things go, perhaps it may be as
well for all of us, and that's about the best that can be said for
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see I'm not romantic, Kate, as you are. Half a dozen children

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I'll tell you what I do want, Kate. I want some money.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) paused, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) did not answer immediately, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was obliged to
go on speaking. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not at all sure that I have not been wrong in
making this attempt to get into Parliament,--that I'm not struggling
to pick fruit which is above my reach.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say that, George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but I can't help feeling it. I need hardly tell you that I am
ready to risk anything of my own. If I know myself I would toss up
to-morrow, or for the matter of that to-day, between the gallows and
a seat in the House. But I cannot go on with this contest by risking
what is merely my own. Money, for immediate use, I have none left,
and my neck, though I were ever so willing to risk it, is of no
service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever I have can be yours to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, in a hesitating
voice, which too plainly pronounced her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) misery as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) made the
offer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) could not refrain herself from making it. Though her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
grandfather's threat was ringing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) ears,--though she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) knew that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) might be ruining her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother by proposing such a loan, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had
no alternative. When her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother told her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) want of money, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
could not abstain from tendering to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) the use of what was her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I shall not take your money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would not scruple, if you knew how welcome you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate, I shall not take it. I should not think it right. All
that you have would only just suffice for my present wants, and I
should not choose to make you a beggar. There would, moreover, be a
difficulty about readjusting the payment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There would be no difficulty, because no one need be consulted but
us two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not think it right, and therefore let there be an end of
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George in a tone of voice which had in it something of
magniloquence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it you wish then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, who knew too well what he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did
wish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will explain to you. When Alice and I are married, of course
there will be a settlement made on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and as we are both the
grandchildren of the old squire I shall propose that the Vavasor
property shall be hers for life in the event of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) outliving me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And if this be done, there can be no harm in my forestalling some
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) property, which, under the circumstances of such a settlement,
would of course become mine when we are married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the squire might leave the property to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) pleases.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We know very well that he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) won't, at any rate, leave it out of the
family. In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) would only be too glad to consent to such an
agreement as that I have proposed, because he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) would thereby rob me of
all power in the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that could not be done till you are married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, Kate;--don't you make difficulties.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And now, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), the cicature on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) face seemed to open and yawn at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``If you mean to say that you won't help me, do say so, and I
will go back to London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would do anything in my power to help you,--that was not wrong!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; anybody could say as much as that. That is not much of an offer
if you are to keep to yourself the power of deciding what is wrong.
Will you write to Alice,--or better still, go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and explain
that I want the money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I go to London now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can do it very well, if you choose. But if that be too much,
then write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). It will come much better from you than from me;
write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and explain that I must pay in advance the expenses
of this contest, and that I cannot look for success unless I do so.
I did not think that the demand would come so quick on me; but they
know that I am not a man of capital, and therefore I cannot expect
them to carry on the fight for me, unless they know that the money is
sure. Scruby has been bitten two or three times by these metropolitan
fellows, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) is determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) will not be bitten again.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) paused for Kate to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said, slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would try any other scheme but that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no other scheme! That's so like a woman;--to quarrel with
the only plan that is practicable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not think you ought to take Alice's money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Kate, you must allow me to be the best judge of what I ought
to do, and what I ought not to do. Alice herself understands the
matter perfectly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knows that I cannot obtain this position, which
is as desirable for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) as it is for me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And for me as much as for either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, interrupting him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. Alice, I say, knows that I cannot do this without money,
and has offered the assistance which I want. I would rather that you
should tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) how much I want, and that I want it now, than that I
should do so. That is all. If you are half the woman that I take you
to be, you will understand this well enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Kate did understand it well enough. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was quite awake to the fact
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother was ashamed of the thing he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was about to do,--so
much ashamed of it that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was desirous of using her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) voice instead
of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own. <div class="bookquote">``I want you to write to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) quite at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) continued;
<div class="bookquote">``since you seem to think that it is not worth while to take the
trouble of a journey to London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no question about the trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate. <div class="bookquote">``I would walk to
London to get the money for you, if that were all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think that Alice will refuse to lend it me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), looking
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would not, but I think that you ought not to take
it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). There seems to me to be something sacred about property
that belongs to the girl you are going to marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If there is anything on earth I hate,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George, walking about
the room, <div class="bookquote">``it is romance. If you keep it for reading in your bedroom,
it's all very well for those who like it, but when it comes to be
mixed up with one's business it plays the devil. If you would only
sift what you have said, you would see what nonsense it is. Alice and
I are to be man and wife. All our interests, and all our money, and
our station in life, whatever it may be, are to be joint property.
And yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is the last person in the world to whom I ought to go for
money to improve her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) prospects as well as my own. That's what you
call delicacy. I call it infernal nonsense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you what I'll do, George. I'll ask Aunt Greenow to lend you
the money,--or to lend it to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)'d give me a shilling. Moreover, I want it quite
immediately, and the time taken up in letter-writing and negotiations
would be fatal to me. If you won't apply to Alice, I must. I want you
to tell me whether you will oblige me in this matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Kate was still hesitating as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) answer, when there came a knock
at the door, and a little crumpled note was brought up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). A boy
had just come with it across the fell from Vavasor Hall, and Kate, as
soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) name on the outside, knew that it was from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
grandfather. It was as follows:--


<p/><div class="bookquote">``If George wishes to come to the Hall, let him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) come. If
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) chooses to tell me that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) regrets his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) conduct to me,
I will see him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George. Then Kate put the note into her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother's
hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll do nothing of the kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What good should I get by
going to the old man's house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate. <div class="bookquote">``If you don't go now you never can do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never till it's my own,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you show him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that you are determined to be at variance with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
it never will be your own;--unless, indeed, it should some day come
to you as part of Alice's fortune. Think of it, George; you would not
like to receive everything from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) walked about the room, muttering maledictions between his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) teeth
and balancing, as best he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was able at such a moment, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pride
against his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) profit. <div class="bookquote">``You haven't answered my question,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``If
I go to the Hall, will you write to Alice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, George; I cannot write to Alice asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) for the money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could not bring myself to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, Kate, you and my grandfather may work together for the future.
You may get him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) to leave you the place if you have skill enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is as undeserved a reproach as any woman ever encountered,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, standing her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) ground boldly before him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``If you have either
heart or conscience, you will feel that it is so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not much troubled with either one or the other, I fancy. Things
are being brought to such a pass with me that I am better without
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you take my money, George; just for the present?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I haven't much conscience; but I have a little left.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you let me write to Mrs. Greenow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not the slightest objection; but it will be of no use
whatsoever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do so, at any rate. And now will you come to the Hall?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To beg that old fool's pardon? No; I won't. In the mood I am in at
present, I couldn't do it. I should only anger him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) worse than ever.
Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) that I've business which calls me back to London at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a thousand pities.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It can't be helped.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It may make so great a difference to you for your whole life!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>urged
Kate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what I'll do,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``I'll go to Vavasor
and put up with the old squire's insolence, if you'll make this
application for me to Alice.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wonder whether it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
that his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sister desired his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) presence at the Hall solely on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own
behalf. The same idea certainly did not occur to Kate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) hesitated,
feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would almost do anything to achieve a reconciliation
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) grandfather and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you'll let me write to Aunt Greenow first,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It will
take only two days,--or at the most three?''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>To this George consented as though he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) were yielding a great deal;
and Kate, with a sore conscience, with a full knowledge that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was
undertaking to do wrong, promised that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would apply to Alice for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) money, if sufficient funds should not be forthcoming from Mrs.
Greenow. Thereupon, George graciously consented to proceed to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
bedroom, and put together his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) clothes with a view to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) visit to the
Hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thank Providence, Kate, that circumstances make it impossible for
me to stay above two days. I have not linen to last me longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll manage that for you at the Hall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed you won't do anything of the kind. And look, Kate, when I
make that excuse don't you offer to do so. I will stay there over
to-morrow night, and shall go into Kendal early, so as to catch the
express train up on Thursday morning. Don't you throw me over by any
counter proposition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then they started together in the car, and very few words were said
till they reached the old lodge, which stood at the entrance to the
place. <div class="bookquote">``Eh, Mr. George; be that you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman, who came out
to swing back for them the broken gate. <div class="bookquote">``A sight of you is good for
sair een.''  (<font color='red'><b>the inn-keeper</b></font>)</div>It was the same welcome that the inn-keeper had given him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>),
and equally sincere. George had never made himself popular about the
place, but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was the heir.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you had better go into the drawing-room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate;
<div class="bookquote">``while I go to my grandfather. You won't find a fire there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Manage it how you please; but don't keep me in the cold very long.
Heavens, what a country house! The middle of January, and no fires in
the room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And remember, George, when you see him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) you must say that you regret
that you ever displeased him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). Now that you are here, don't let there
be any further misunderstanding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it very probable that there will be,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``I only
hope he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'ll let me have the old horse to take me back to Shap if there
is. There he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is at the front door, so I shan't have to go into the
room without a fire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man was standing at the hall steps when the car drove up, as
though to welcome his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) grandson. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand to help Kate down
the steps, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eye all the time on George's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you've come back,''  (<font color='red'><b>the squire</b></font>)</div>the squire said to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``So you've come back, have you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir;--I've come back, like the prodigal son in the parable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The prodigal son was contrite. I hope you are so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty well for that, sir. I'm sorry there has been any quarrel, and
all that, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go in,''  (<font color='red'><b>the squire</b></font>)</div>said the squire, very angrily. <div class="bookquote">``Go in. To expect anything
gracious from you would be to expect pearls from swine. Go in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>George went in, shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) shoulders as his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eyes met his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sister's.
It was in this fashion that the reconciliation took place between
Squire Vavasor and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) heir.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIX.

<p/>Mr. Cheesacre's Hospitality.


<p/>As the winter wore itself away, Mr. Cheesacre, happy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was amidst
the sports of Norfolk, and prosperous as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) might be with the augean
spoils of Oileymead, fretted himself with an intense anxiety to bring
to a close that affair which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) hands with the widow
Greenow. There were two special dangers which disturbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
would give herself and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) money to that adventurer, Bellfield;
or else she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) would spend her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) own money so fast before he (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>) got hold upon
it, that the prize would be greatly damaged. <div class="bookquote">``I'm -- if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hasn't
been and set up a carriage!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>) said to himself one day, as standing
on the pavement of Tombland, in Norwich, he (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>) saw Mrs. Greenow issue
forth from the Close in a private brougham, accompanied by one of the
Fairstairs girls. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s been and set up her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) carriage as sure as my
name's Cheesacre!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Whatever reason he (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>) might have to fear the former danger, we may
declare that he (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>) had none whatever as to the latter. Mrs. Greenow knew
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was doing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) money as well as any lady in England. The
private carriage was only a hired brougham taken by the month, and as
to that boy in buttons whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had lately established, why should
she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) not keep a young servant, and call him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) a page, if it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) any
comfort to do so? If Mr. Cheesacre had also known that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had lent
the Fairstairs family fifty pounds to help them through with some
difficulty which Joe had encountered with the Norwich tradespeople,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) would have been beside himself with dismay. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) desired to obtain
the prize unmutilated,--in all its fair proportions. Any such
clippings he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) regarded as robberies against himself.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) feared Bellfield more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) feared the brougham. That
all is fair in love and war was no doubt, at this period, Captain
Bellfield's maxim, and we can only trust that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) found in it some
consolation, or ease to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) conscience, in regard to the monstrous
lies which he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) friend. In war, no doubt, all stratagems are
fair. The one general is quite justified in making the other believe
that he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) is far to the right, when in truth he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) is turning his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) enemy's
left flank. If successful, he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) will be put upon a pedestal for his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>)
clever deceit, and crowned with laurels because of his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) lie. If
Bellfield could only be successful, and achieve for himself the
mastery over those forty thousand pounds, the world would forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>)
and place, on his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) brow also, some not uncomfortable crown. In the
mean time, his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) stratagems were as deep and his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) lies as profound as
those of any general.

<p/>It must not be supposed that Cheesacre ever believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>). In the
first place, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) knew that Bellfield was not a man to be believed
in any way. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) not been living on lies for the last ten years?
But then a man may lie in such a way as to deceive, though no one
believe him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Mr. Cheesacre was kept in an agony of doubt while Captain
Bellfield occupied his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) lodgings in Norwich. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) fee'd Jeannette
liberally. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) even fee'd Charlie Fairstairs,--Miss Fairstairs I
mean,--with gloves, and chickens from Oileymead, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fairstairs</b></font>) might
know whether that kite fluttered about his (<font color='blue'><b>Fairstairs</b></font>) dovecoat, and of what
nature were the flutterings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fairstairs</b></font>) went even further than this, and
fee'd the Captain himself,--binding him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) down not to flutter as
value given in return for such fees. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) attempted even to fee the
widow,--cautioning her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) against the fluttering, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) tendered to
her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>), on his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) knees, a brooch as big as a breast-plate. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) waved aside
the breast-plate, declaring that the mourning ring which contained
poor Greenow's final grey lock of hair, was the last article from a
jeweller's shop which should ever find a place about her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) person. At
the same time she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) declared that Captain Bellfield was nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>);
Mr. Cheesacre need have no fears in that quarter. But then, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) added,
neither was he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) to have any hope. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) affections were all buried under
the cold sod. This was harassing. Nevertheless, though no absolute
satisfaction was to be attained in the wooing of Mrs. Greenow, there
was a pleasantness in the occupation which ought to have reconciled
her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) suitors to their destiny. With most ladies, when a gentleman has
been on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knees before one of them in the morning, with outspoken
protestations of love, with clearly defined proffers of marriage,
with a minute inventory of the offerer's worldly wealth,--down even
to the <div class="bookquote">``mahogany-furnitured''  (<font color='red'><b>the offerer</b></font>)</div>bed-chambers, as was the case with
Mr. Cheesacre, and when all these overtures have been peremptorily
declined,--a gentleman in such a case, I say, would generally feel
some awkwardness in sitting down to tea with the lady at the close
of such a performance. But with Mrs. Greenow there was no such
awkwardness. After an hour's work of the nature above described she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
would play the hostess with a genial hospitality, that eased off
all the annoyance of disappointment; and then at the end of the
evening, she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) would accept a squeeze of the hand, a good, palpable,
long-protracted squeeze, with that sort of <div class="bookquote">``don't;--have done now,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>by which Irish young ladies allure their lovers. Mr. Cheesacre, on
such occasions, would leave the Close, swearing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) should be
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) on the next market-day,--or at any rate, on the next Saturday.
Then, on the Monday, tidings would reach him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) that Bellfield had
passed all Sunday afternoon with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) lady-love,--Bellfield, to whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had lent five pounds on purpose that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) might be enabled to
spend that very Sunday with some officers of the Suffolk volunteers
at Ipswich. And hearing this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) would walk out among those rich
heaps, at the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) farmyard, uttering deep curses against the
falsehood of men and the fickleness of women.

<p/>Driven to despair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) at last resolved to ask Bellfield to come to
Oileymead for a month. That drilling at Norwich, or the part of it
which was supposed to be profitable, was wearing itself out. Funds
were low with the Captain,--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) did not scruple to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) friend
Cheesacre, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) accepted the invitation. <div class="bookquote">``I'll mount you with the
harriers, old fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>Cheesacre had said; <div class="bookquote">``and give you a little
shooting. Only I won't have you go out when I'm not with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>Bellfield agreed, Each of them understood the nature of the bargain;
though Bellfield, I think, had somewhat the clearer understanding
in the matter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) would not be so near the widow as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had been at
Norwich, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) would not be less near than his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) kind host. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
host would no doubt watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) closely;--but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) also could watch
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) host. There was a railway station not two miles from Oileymead,
and the journey thence into Norwich was one of half an hour. Mr.
Cheesacre would doubtless be very jealous of such journeys, but with
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) jealousy he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) could not prevent them. And then, in regard
to this arrangement, Mr. Cheesacre paid the piper, whereas Captain
Bellfield paid nothing. Would it not be sweet to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) could
carry off his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) friend's prize from under the very eaves of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
friend's house?

<p/>And Mrs. Greenow also understood the arrangement. <div class="bookquote">``Going to Oileymead;
are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) said when Captain Bellfield came to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
departure. Charlie Fairstairs was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>), so that the Captain could
not utilize the moment in any special way. <div class="bookquote">``It's quite delightful,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>continued the widow, <div class="bookquote">``to see how fond you two gentlemen are of each
other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think gentlemen always like to go best to gentlemen's houses where
there are no ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie/Charlie Fairstairs</b></font>)</div>said Charlie Fairstairs, whose career in life
had not as yet been satisfactory to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div>said Bellfield, <div class="bookquote">``I wish with all my heart that dear
old Cheesy would get a wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wants a wife badly, if ever a man
did, with all that house full of blankets and crockery. Why don't you
set your cap at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Miss Fairstairs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What;--at a farmer!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie/Charlie Fairstairs</b></font>)</div>said Charlie who was particularly anxious that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) dear friend, Mrs. Greenow, should not marry Mr. Cheesacre, and who
weakly thought to belittle him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) accordingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) my kind love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow, thereby resenting the
impotent interference. <div class="bookquote">``And look here, Captain Bellfield, suppose you
both dine with me next Saturday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) always comes in on Saturday, and
you might as well come too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>Captain Bellfield declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) would only be too happy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Charlie shall come to set her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) cap at Mr. Cheesacre,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the
widow, turning a soft and gracious eye on the Captain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be happy to come,'' (<font color='red'><b>Charlie/Charlie Fairstairs</b></font>)</div>--said Charlie, quite delighted; <div class="bookquote">``but
not with that object. Mr. Cheesacre is very respectable, I'm sure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Charlie/Charlie Fairstairs</b></font>)</div>Charlie's mother had been the daughter of a small squire who had
let his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) land to tenants, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was, therefore, justified by
circumstances in looking down upon a farmer.

<p/>The matter was so settled,--pending the consent of Mr. Cheesacre; and
Bellfield went out to Oileymead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) knew the ways of the house, and
was not surprised to find himself left alone till after dusk; nor was
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) much surprised when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) learned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was not put into one of the
mahogany-furnitured chambers, but into a back room looking over the
farm-yard in which there was no fire-place. The Captain had already
endured some of the evils of poverty, and could have put up with this
easily had nothing been said about it. As it was, Cheesacre brought
the matter forward, and apologized, and made the thing difficult.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, old fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``there are the rooms, and of course
they're empty. But it's such a bore hauling out all the things and
putting up the curtains. You'll be very snug where you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall do very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div>said Bellfield rather sulkily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you'll do very well. It's the warmest room in the house in
one way.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) did not say in what way. Perhaps the near neighbourhood
of the stables may have had a warming effect.

<p/>Bellfield did not like it; but what is a poor man to do under such
circumstances? So he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went up-stairs and washed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands before
dinner in the room without a fire-place, flattering himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would yet be even with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend Cheesacre.

<p/>They dined together not in the best humour, and after dinner they
sat down to enjoy themselves with pipes and brandy and water.
Bellfield, having a taste for everything that was expensive, would
have preferred cigars; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) friend put none upon the table. Mr.
Cheesacre, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) could spend his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) money liberally when occasion
required such spending, knew well the value of domestic economy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
wasn't going to put himself out, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) called it, for Bellfield! What
was good enough for himself was good enough for Bellfield. <div class="bookquote">``A beggar,
you know; just a regular beggar!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was betrayed into saying
to Mrs. Greenow on some occasion just at this period. <div class="bookquote">``Poor fellow!
He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) only wants money to make him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) almost perfect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Greenow had
answered;--and Mr. Cheesacre had felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had made a mistake.

<p/>Both the men became talkative, if not good-humoured, under the
effects of the brandy and water, and the Captain then communicated
Mrs. Greenow's invitation to Mr. Cheesacre. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had had his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) doubts as
to the propriety of doing so,--thinking that perhaps it might be to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) advantage to forget the message. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) reflected that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was
at any rate a match for Cheesacre when they were present together,
and finally came to the conclusion that the message should be
delivered. <div class="bookquote">``I had to go and just wish her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) goodbye you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) said
apologetically, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) little speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see that at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my dear fellow, how foolishly jealous you are. If I were to be
downright uncivil to her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>), as you would have me be, it would only call
attention to the thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not a bit jealous. A man who sits upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own ground as I do
hasn't any occasion to be jealous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what your own ground has to do with it,--but we'll let
that pass.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it has a great deal to do with it. If a man does intend to
marry he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to have things comfortable about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); unless he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants
to live on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, which I look upon as about the meanest thing a
man can do. By George, I'd sooner break stones than that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>any captain</b></font>)</div><p/>This was hard for any captain to bear,--even for Captain Bellfield;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) did bear it,--looking forward to revenge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no pleasing you, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But there's the fact.
I went to say goodbye to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) asked me to give you that
message. Shall we go or not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div><p/>Cheesacre sat for some time silent, blowing out huge clouds of
smoke while he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) meditated a little plan. <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what it is,
Bellfield,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>)'s nothing to you, and if you won't
mind it, I'll go. Mrs. Jones shall get you anything you like for
dinner,--and,--and--I'll stand you a bottle of the '34 port!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>But Captain Bellfield was not going to put up with this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had
not sold himself altogether to work Mr. Cheesacre's will. <div class="bookquote">``No, old
fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``that cock won't fight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) has asked me to dine
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) on Saturday, and I mean to go. I don't intend that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) shall
think that I'm afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>),--or of you either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't;--don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain stoutly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you'd pay me some of that money you owe me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So I will,--when I've married the widow. Ha,--ha,--ha.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div><p/>Cheesacre longed to turn him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) out of the house. Words to bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) go,
were, so to say, upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) tongue. But the man would only have taken
himself to Norwich, and would have gone without any embargo upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
suit; all their treaties would then be at an end. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) knows a trick
worth two of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) does; and if so, why shouldn't I go and dine with her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
next Saturday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you why,--because you're in my way. The deuce is in it if
I haven't made the whole thing clear enough. I've told you all my
plans because I thought you were my friend, and I've paid you well to
help me, too; and yet it seems to me you'd do anything in your power
to throw me over,--only you can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What an ass you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain after a pause; <div class="bookquote">``just you
listen to me. That scraggy young woman, Charlie Fairstairs, is to be
there of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you that I do know. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was present when the whole thing
was arranged, and I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked, and heard her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) say that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
would come;--and for the matter of that I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) declare that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
wouldn't set her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cap at you, because you're a farmer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s kind. Upon my word she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre,
getting very angry and very red. <div class="bookquote">``Charlie Fairstairs, indeed! I
wouldn't pick her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) out of a gutter with a pair of tongs. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ain't
good enough for my bailiff, let alone me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But somebody must take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in hand on Saturday, if you're to do any
good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div>said the crafty Bellfield.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What the deuce does she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) have that nasty creature there for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said
Cheesacre, who thought it very hard that everything should not be
arranged exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) would desire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wants a companion, of course. You can get rid of Charlie, you
know, when you make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Mrs. Cheesacre.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Get rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)! You don't suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)'ll ever put her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) foot in this
house. Not if I know it. I've detested that woman for the last ten
years.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>Cheesacre could forgive no word of slight respecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
social position, and the idea of Miss Fairstairs having pretended to
look down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), galled him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) to the quick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll have to dine with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div>said Bellfield, <div class="bookquote">``and
I always think that four are better company than three on such
occasions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Cheesacre grunted an unwilling assent, and after this it was
looked upon as an arranged thing that they two should go into Norwich
on the Saturday together, and that they should both dine with the
widow. Indeed, Mrs. Greenow got two notes, one from each of them,
accepting the invitation. Cheesacre wrote in the singular number,
altogether ignoring Captain Bellfield, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) might have ignored his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
footman had he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) intended to take one. The captain condescended to use
the plural pronoun. <div class="bookquote">``We shall be so happy to come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Dear
old Cheesy is out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) little wits with delight,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``and
has already begun to polish off the effects of the farmyard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Effects of the farmyard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow aloud, in Jeannette's
hearing, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) received the note. <div class="bookquote">``It would be well for Captain
Bellfield if he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had a few such effects himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can give him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) enough, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>said Jeannette, <div class="bookquote">``to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) a
better man than Mr. Cheesacre any day. And for a gentleman--of course
I say nothing, but if I was a lady, I know which should be the man
for me.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XL.

<p/>Mrs. Greenow's Little Dinner in the Close.


<p/>How deep and cunning are the wiles of love! When that Saturday
morning arrived not a word was said by Cheesacre to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) rival as
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) plans for the day. <div class="bookquote">``You'll take the dog-cart in?''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>Captain
Bellfield had asked overnight. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know what I shall do as yet,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) who was master of the house, of the dog-cart, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
fondly thought, of the situation. But Bellfield knew that Cheesacre
must take the dog-cart, and was contented. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) friend would leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
behind, if it were possible, but Bellfield would take care that it
should not be possible.

<p/>Before breakfast Mr. Cheesacre surreptitiously carried out into the
yard a bag containing all his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) apparatus for dressing,--his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) marrow
oil for his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) hair, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) shirt with the wondrous worked front upon an
under-stratum of pink to give it colour, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) shiny boots, and all
the rest of the paraphernalia. When dining in Norwich on ordinary
occasions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) simply washed his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) hands there, trusting to the
chambermaid at the inn to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) a comb; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) came down with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) bag surreptitiously, and hid it away in the back of the dog-cart
with secret, but alas, not unobserved hands, hoping that Bellfield
would forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) toilet. But when did such a Captain ever forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
outward man? Cheesacre, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) returned through the kitchen from the
yard into the front hall, perceived another bag lying near the door,
apparently filled almost as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What the deuce are you going to do with all this luggage?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>),
giving the bag a kick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put it where I saw you putting yours when I opened my window just
now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div>said Bellfield.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``D-- the window,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Cheesacre, and then they sat down to
breakfast. <div class="bookquote">``How you do hack that ham about,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``If you ever
found hams yourself you'd be more particular in cutting them.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This
was very bad. Even Bellfield could not bear it with equanimity, and
feeling unable to eat the ham under such circumstances, made his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>)
breakfast with a couple of fresh eggs. <div class="bookquote">``If you didn't mean to eat the
meat, why the mischief did you cut it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, Cheesacre, you're too bad;--upon my word you are,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div>said Bellfield, almost sobbing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter now?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who wants your ham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do, I suppose, or you wouldn't cut it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No I don't; nor anything else either that you've got. It isn't fair
to ask a fellow into your house, and then say such things to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) as
that. And it isn't what I've been accustomed to either; I can tell
you that, Mr. Cheesacre.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, bother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all very well to say bother, but I choose to be treated like a
gentleman wherever I go. You and I have known each other a long time,
and I'd put up with more from you than from anyone else; but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you pay me the money that you owe me, Bellfield?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said
Cheesacre, looking hard at him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div>said Bellfield; <div class="bookquote">``not immediately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then eat your breakfast, and hold your tongue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>After that Captain Bellfield did eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) breakfast,--leaving the ham
however untouched, and did hold his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) tongue, vowing vengeance in his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>)
heart. But the two men went into Norwich more amicably together than
they would have done had there been no words between them. Cheesacre
felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had trespassed a little, and therefore offered the
Captain a cigar as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) seated himself in the cart. Bellfield accepted
the offering, and smoked the weed of peace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) drove into the Swan yard, <div class="bookquote">``what do you
mean to do with yourself all day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall go down to the quarters, and look the fellows up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right. But mind this, Bellfield;--it's an understood thing, that
you're not to be in the Close before four?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't be in the Close before four!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. That's understood. If you deceive me, I'll not drive you
back to Oileymead to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>In this instance Captain Bellfield had no intention to deceive.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) did not think it probable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) could do himself any good
by philandering about the widow early in the day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) would be
engaged with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) dinner and with an early toilet. Captain Bellfield,
moreover, had learned from experience that the first comer has not
always an advantage in ladies' society. The mind of a woman is greedy
after novelty, and it is upon the stranger, or upon the most strange
of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) slaves around her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) often smiles the sweetest. The
cathedral clock, therefore, had struck four before Captain Bellfield
rang Mrs. Greenow's bell, and then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was shown into the
drawing-room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) found Cheesacre there alone, redolent with the
marrow oil, and beautiful with the pink bosom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't you seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>asked the Captain almost in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre sulkily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor yet Charlie Fairstairs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've seen nobody,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre.

<p/>But at this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was compelled to swallow his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) anger, as Mrs.
Greenow, accompanied by her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) lady guest, came into the room. <div class="bookquote">``Whoever
would have expected two gentlemen to be so punctual,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``especially on market-day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Market-day makes no difference when I come to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said
Cheesacre, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) best foot forward, while Captain Bellfield
contented himself with saying something civil to Charlie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) would
bide his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) time and ride a waiting race.

<p/>The widow was almost gorgeous in her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) weeds. I believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
had not sinned in her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) dress against any of those canons which the
semi-ecclesiastical authorities on widowhood have laid down as to the
outward garments fitted for gentlemen's relicts. The materials were
those which are devoted to the deepest conjugal grief. As regarded
every item of the written law her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) suttee worship was carried out
to the letter. There was the widow's cap, generally so hideous,
so well known to the eyes of all men, so odious to womanhood. Let
us hope that such headgear may have some assuaging effect on the
departed spirits of husbands. There was the dress of deep, clinging,
melancholy crape,--of crape which becomes so brown and so rusty,
and which makes the six months' widow seem so much more afflicted
a creature than she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) whose husband is just gone, and whose crape is
therefore new. There were the trailing weepers, and the widow's
kerchief pinned close round her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) neck and somewhat tightly over her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
bosom. But there was that of genius about Mrs. Greenow, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had
turned every seeming disadvantage to some special profit, and had so
dressed herself that though she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had obeyed the law to the letter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
had thrown the spirit of it to the winds. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) cap sat jauntily on her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
head, and showed just so much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) rich brown hair as to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
the appearance of youth which she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) desired. Cheesacre had blamed her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) heart for her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) private carriage, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) spent more money, I
think, on new crape than she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) did on her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) brougham. It never became
brown and rusty with her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), or formed itself into old lumpy folds, or
shaped itself round her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) like a grave cloth. The written law had not
interdicted crinoline, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) loomed as large with weeds, which
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) were not sombre, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) would do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) silks when the
period of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) probation should be over. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) weepers were bright with
newness, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) would waft them aside from her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) shoulder with an air
which turned even them into auxiliaries. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) kerchief was fastened
close round her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) neck and close over her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) bosom; but Jeannette well
knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) was doing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) fastened it,--and so did Jeannette's
mistress.

<p/>Mrs. Greenow would still talk much about her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) husband, declaring that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) loss was as fresh to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) wounded heart, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), on whom
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) happiness had rested, had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) only yesterday; but
yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) mistook her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) dates, frequently referring to the melancholy
circumstance, as having taken place fifteen months ago. In truth,
however, Mr. Greenow had been alive within the last nine months,--as
everybody around her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) knew. But if she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) chose to forget the exact day,
why should her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) friends or dependents remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) of it? No friend or
dependent did remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) of it, and Charlie Fairstairs spoke of the
fifteen months with bold confidence,--false-tongued little parasite
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Looking well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow, in answer to some outspoken
compliment from Mr. Cheesacre. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I'm well enough in health, and
I suppose I ought to be thankful that it is so. But if you had buried
a wife whom you had loved within the last eighteen months, you would
have become as indifferent as I am to all that kind of thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never was married yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cheesacre.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And therefore you know nothing about it. Everything in the world
is gay and fresh to you. If I were you, Mr. Cheesacre, I would not
run the risk. It is hardly worth a woman's while, and I suppose not
a man's. The sufferings are too great!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Whereupon she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
handkerchief to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I mean to try all the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre, looking the lover
all over as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) gazed into the fair one's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope that you may be successful, Mr. Cheesacre, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may
not be torn away from you early in life. Is dinner ready, Jeannette?
That's well. Mr. Cheesacre, will you give your arm to Miss
Fairstairs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no doubt as to Mrs. Greenow's correctness. As Captain
Bellfield held, or had held, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) Majesty's commission, he (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) was clearly
entitled to take the mistress of the festival down to dinner. But
Cheesacre would not look at it in this light. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) would only remember
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had paid for the Captain's food for some time past, that the
Captain had been brought into Norwich in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) gig, that the Captain
owed him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) money, and ought, so to say, to be regarded as his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) property
on the occasion. <div class="bookquote">``I pay my way, and that ought to give a man higher
station than being a beggarly captain,--which I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) is,
if all the truth was known.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was thus that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) took an occasion to
express himself to Miss Fairstairs on that very evening. <div class="bookquote">``Military
rank is always recognised,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>Miss Fairstairs had replied, taking Mr.
Cheesacre's remarks as a direct slight upon herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
down to dinner, and had then come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) complaining that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had been
injured in being called upon to do so! <div class="bookquote">``If you were a magistrate, Mr.
Cheesacre, you would have rank; but I believe you are not.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie/Charlie Fairstairs</b></font>)</div>Charlie
Fairstairs knew well what she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was about. Mr. Cheesacre had striven
much to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) name put upon the commission of the peace, but had
failed. <div class="bookquote">``Nasty, scraggy old cat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>Cheesacre said to himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
turned away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>).

<p/>But Bellfield gained little by taking the widow down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) and
Cheesacre were placed at the top and bottom of the table, so that
they might do the work of carving; and the ladies sat at the sides.
Mrs. Greenow's hospitality was very good. The dinner was exactly
what a dinner ought to be for four persons. There was soup, fish,
a cutlet, a roast fowl, and some game. Jeannette waited at table
nimbly, and the thing could not have been done better. Mrs. Greenow's
appetite was not injured by her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) grief, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) so far repressed for
the time all remembrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) sorrow as to enable her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) to play the
kind hostess to perfection. Under her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) immediate eye Cheesacre was
forced into apparent cordiality with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) friend Bellfield, and the
Captain himself took the good things which the gods provided with
thankful good-humour.

<p/>Nothing, however, was done at the dinner-table. No work got itself
accomplished. The widow was so accurately fair in the adjustment of
her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) favours, that even Jeannette could not perceive to which of the
two she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) turned with the amplest smile. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) talked herself and made
others talk, till Cheesacre became almost comfortable, in spite of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) jealousy. <div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) got up to leave the room,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) own glass of wine, <div class="bookquote">``We will allow these two
gentlemen just half an hour, eh Charlie? and then we shall expect
them up-stairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten minutes will be enough for us here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre, who was in
a hurry to utilize his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Half an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow, not without some little tone of
command in her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) voice. Ten minutes might be enough for Mr. Cheesacre,
but ten minutes was not enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>).

<p/>Bellfield had opened the door, and it was upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) that the widow's
eye glanced as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) left the room. Cheesacre saw it, and resolved to
resent the injury. <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what it is, Bellfield,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) said, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) sat down moodily over the fire, <div class="bookquote">``I won't have you coming here at
all, till this matter is settled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Till what matter is settled?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div>said Bellfield, filling his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what matter I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You take such a deuce of a time about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't. I take as little time as anybody could. That other
fellow has only been dead about nine months, and I've got the thing
in excellent training already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what harm do I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You disturb me, and you disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). You do it on purpose. Do you
suppose I can't see? I'll tell you what, now; if you'll go clean out
of Norwich for a month, I'll lend you two hundred pounds on the day
she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) becomes Mrs. Cheesacre.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And where am I to go to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may stay at Oileymead, if you like;--that is, on condition that
you do stay there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And be told that I hack the ham because it's not my own. Shall I
tell you a piece of my mind, Cheesacre?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That woman has no more idea of marrying you than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has of marrying
the Bishop. Won't you fill your glass, old fellow? I know where the
tap is if you want another bottle. You may as well give it up, and
spend no more money in pink fronts and polished boots on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) account.
You're a podgy man, you see, and Mrs. Greenow doesn't like podgy men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div><p/>Cheesacre sat looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) mouth open, dumb with surprise,
and almost paralysed with impotent anger. What had happened during
the last few hours to change so entirely the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) dependent
captain? Could it be that Bellfield had been there during the
morning, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) had accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very podgy, Cheesacre,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div>Bellfield continued, <div class="bookquote">``and then you
so often smell of the farm-yard; and you talk too much of your money
and your property. You'd have had a better chance if you had openly
talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) of hers,--as I have done. As it is, you haven't any
chance at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Bellfield, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) thus spoke to the man opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), went on
drinking his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) wine comfortably, and seemed to be chuckling with glee.
Cheesacre was so astounded, so lost in amazement that the creature
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had fed,--whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had bribed with money out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) own
pocket, should thus turn against him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), that for a while he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) could not
collect his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) thoughts or find voice wherewith to make any answer. It
occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) immediately that Bellfield was even now, at this very
time, staying at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) house,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), Cheesacre, was expected to
drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), Bellfield, back to Oileymead, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) own Oileymead, on
this very evening; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) thought of this he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) almost fancied that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) must be in a dream. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) shook himself, and looked again, and there
sat Bellfield, eyeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) through the bright colour of a glass of
port.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I've told you a bit of my mind, Cheesy, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div>continued
Bellfield, <div class="bookquote">``and you'll save yourself a deal of trouble and annoyance
if you'll believe what I say. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) doesn't mean to marry you. It's
most probable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)'ll marry me; but, at any rate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) won't marry
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to pay me my money, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre, at last,
finding his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) readiest means of attack in that quarter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But when?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When I've married Mrs. Greenow,--and, therefore, I expect your
assistance in that little scheme. Let us drink her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) health. We shall
always be delighted to see you at our house, Cheesy, my boy, and you
shall be allowed to hack the hams just as much as you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall be made to pay for this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre, gasping with
anger;--gasping almost more with dismay than he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) did with anger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, old fellow; I'll pay for it,--with the widow's money.
Come; our half-hour is nearly over; shall we go up-stairs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll expose you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't now;--don't be ill-natured.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you tell me where you mean to sleep to-night, Captain
Bellfield?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I sleep at Oileymead it will only be on condition that I have one
of the mahogany-furnitured bedrooms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll never put your foot in that house again. You're a rascal,
sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, Cheesy, it won't do for us to quarrel in a lady's house.
It wouldn't be the thing at all. You're not drinking your wine. You
might as well take another glass, and then we'll go up-stairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've left your traps at Oileymead, and not one of them you shall
have till you've paid me every shilling you owe me. I don't believe
you've a shirt in the world beyond what you've got there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's lucky I brought one in to change; wasn't it, Cheesy? I
shouldn't have thought of it only for the hint you gave me. I might
as well ring the bell for Jeannette to put away the wine, if you
won't take any more.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) rang the bell, and when Jeannette came
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) skipped lightly up-stairs into the drawing-room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) here before to-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre, nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) head at the
doorway through which Bellfield had passed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who? The Captain? Oh dear no. The Captain don't come here much
now;--not to say often, by no means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)'s a confounded rascal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Cheesacre!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>said Jeannette.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) is;--and I ain't sure that there ain't others nearly as bad as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you mean me, Mr. Cheesacre, I do declare you're a wronging me; I
do indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) going on in this way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) ways, Mr. Cheesacre; but I've been as
true to you, sir;--so I have;--as true as true.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>And Jeannette put
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) handkerchief up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) moved to the door, and then a thought occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) trousers pocket, and turning back towards the girl, gave
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) half-a-crown. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) curtsied as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) took it, and then repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
last words. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. Cheesacre,--as true as true.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>Mr. Cheesacre said
nothing further, but followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) enemy up to the drawing-room. <div class="bookquote">``What
game is up now, I wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>said Jeannette to herself, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) was
left alone. <div class="bookquote">``They two'll be cutting each other's throatses before
they've done, and then my missus will take the surwiver.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)
made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) mind that Cheesacre should be the one to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) throat
cut fatally, and that Bellfield should be the survivor.

<p/>Cheesacre, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) reached the drawing-room, found Bellfield sitting
on the same sofa with Mrs. Greenow looking at a book of photographs
which they both of them were handling together. The outside rim of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) widow's frill on one occasion touched the Captain's whisker, and
as it did so the Captain looked up with a gratified expression of
triumph. If any gentleman has ever seen the same thing under similar
circumstances, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) will understand that Cheesacre must have been
annoyed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow, waving her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) handkerchief, of which little but
a two-inch-deep border seemed to be visible. Bellfield knew at once
that it was not the same handkerchief which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) had waved before they
went down to dinner. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,--there he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) is. It's so like him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) apostrophized the _carte de visite_ of the departed one. <div class="bookquote">``Dear
Greenow; dear husband! When my spirit is false to thee, let thine
forget to visit me softly in my dreams. Thou wast unmatched among
husbands. Whose tender kindness was ever equal to thine? whose sweet
temper was ever so constant? whose manly care so all-sufficient?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div>While the words fell from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) lips her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) little finger was touching
Bellfield's little finger, as they held the book between them.
Charlie Fairstairs and Mr. Cheesacre were watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) narrowly, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) knew that they were watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) was certainly a woman of
great genius and of great courage.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``Dear Greenow; dear husband!'' (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/>Bellfield, moved by the eloquence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) words, looked with some
interest at the photograph. There was represented there before him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>),
a small, grey-looking, insignificant old man, with pig's eyes and a
toothless mouth,--one who should never have been compelled to submit
himself to the cruelty of the sun's portraiture! Another widow, even
if she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had kept in her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) book the photograph of such a husband, would
have scrambled it over silently,--would have been ashamed to show it.
<div class="bookquote">``Have you ever seen it, Mr. Cheesacre?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Greenow. <div class="bookquote">``It's so
like him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw it at Yarmouth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre, very sulkily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That you did not,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady with some dignity, and not a little
of rebuke in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tone; <div class="bookquote">``simply because it never was at Yarmouth. A
larger one you may have seen, which I always keep, and always shall
keep, close by my bedside.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if I know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain Bellfield to himself. Then the widow
punished Mr. Cheesacre for his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) sullenness by whispering a few words to
the Captain; and Cheesacre in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) wrath turned to Charlie Fairstairs.
Then it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) spake out his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) mind about the Captain's rank, and
was snubbed by Charlie,--as was told a page or two back.

<p/>After that, coffee was brought to them, and here again Cheesacre in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) ill-humour allowed the Captain to out-manoeuvre him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). It was the
Captain who put the sugar into the cups and handed them round. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
even handed a cup to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) enemy. <div class="bookquote">``None for me, Captain Bellfield; many
thanks for your politeness all the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cheesacre; and
Mrs. Greenow knew from the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) voice that there had been a
quarrel.

<p/>Cheesacre sitting then in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) gloom, had resolved upon one
thing,--or, I may perhaps say, upon two things. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had resolved that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) would not leave the room that evening till Bellfield had left it;
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) would get a final answer from the widow, if not that
night,--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) thought it very possible that they might both be sent
away together,--then early after breakfast on the following morning.
For the present, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had given up any idea of turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) time to
good account. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was not perhaps a coward, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had not that
special courage which enables a man to fight well under adverse
circumstances. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had been cowed by the unexpected impertinence of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) rival,--by the insolence of a man to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had
obtained the power of being always himself as insolent as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) pleased.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) could not recover his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) ground quickly, or carry himself before his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
lady's eye as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was unconscious of the wound he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had received.
So he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) sat silent, while Bellfield was discoursing fluently. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) sat
in silence, comforting himself with reflections on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) own wealth,
and on the poverty of the other, and promising himself a rich harvest
of revenge when the moment should come in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) might tell Mrs.
Greenow how absolutely that man was a beggar, a swindler, and a
rascal.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) was astonished when an opportunity for doing so came very
quickly. Before the neighbouring clock had done striking seven,
Bellfield rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) chair to go. He (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) first of all spoke a word of
farewell to Miss Fairstairs; then he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) late host; <div class="bookquote">``Good
night, Cheesacre,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) said, in the easiest tone in the world; after
that he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) pressed the widow's hand and whispered his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) adieu.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you were staying at Oileymead?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I came from there this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) isn't going back there, I can tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cheesacre.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow; <div class="bookquote">``I hope there is nothing wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All as right as a trivet,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I promised mamma that I would be home by seven,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie/Charlie Fairstairs</b></font>)</div>said Charlie
Fairstairs, rising from her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) chair. It cannot be supposed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had
any wish to oblige Mr. Cheesacre, and therefore this movement on her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
part must be regarded simply as done in kindness to Mrs. Greenow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
might be mistaken in supposing that Mrs. Greenow would desire to be
left alone with Mr. Cheesacre; but it was clear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) that in this
way she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) could give no offence, whereas it was quite possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
might offend by remaining. A little after seven Mr. Cheesacre found
himself alone with the lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry to find,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), gravely, <div class="bookquote">``that you two have
quarrelled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Greenow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), jumping up, and becoming on a sudden full of
life, <div class="bookquote">``that man is a downright swindler.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Cheesacre.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) is. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)'ll tell you that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was at Inkerman, but I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
was in prison all the time.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Captain</b></font>)</div>The Captain had been arrested, I think
twice, and thus Mr. Cheesacre justified to himself this assertion. <div class="bookquote">``I
doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) ever saw a shot fired,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) continued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)'s none the worse for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) tells such lies; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) has not a penny in the world.
How much do you suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) owes me, now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``However much it is, I'm sure you are too much of a gentleman to
say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--yes, I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), trying to recover himself. <div class="bookquote">``But when I
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) intended to pay me, what do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said? He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'d pay me when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) got your money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My money! He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) couldn't have said that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``But he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did, Mrs. Greenow; I give you my word and honour. ``I'll pay
you when I get the widow's money,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You gentlemen must have a nice way of talking about me when I am
absent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never said a disrespectful word about you in my life, Mrs.
Greenow,--or thought one. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) does;--he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) says horrible things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What horrible things, Mr. Cheesacre?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I can't tell you;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) does. What can you expect from such
a man as that, who, to my knowledge, won't have a change of clothes
to-morrow, except what he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) brought in on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) back this morning. Where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)'s to get a bed to-night, I don't know, for I doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)'s
got half-a-crown in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Bellfield!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) is poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how gracefully he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) carries his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) poverty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should call it very disgraceful, Mrs. Greenow.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>To this she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) made
no reply, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) might begin his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) work. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs.
Greenow,--may I say Arabella?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Cheesacre!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But mayn't I? Come, Mrs. Greenow. You know well enough by this time
what it is I mean. What's the use of shilly-shallying?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shilly-shallying, Mr. Cheesacre! I never heard such language. If I
bid you good night, now, and tell you that it is time for you to go
home, shall you call that shilly-shallying?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had made a mistake in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) word and repented it. <div class="bookquote">``I beg your

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shilly-shallying, indeed! There's very little shall in it, I can
assure you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The poor man was dreadfully crestfallen, so much so that the widow's
heart relented, and she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) pardoned him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It was not in her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) nature to
quarrel with people;--at any rate, not with her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) lovers. <div class="bookquote">``I beg your
pardon, Mrs. Greenow,''  (<font color='red'><b>the culprit</b></font>)</div>said the culprit, humbly. <div class="bookquote">``It is granted,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said
the widow; <div class="bookquote">``but never tell a lady again that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) is shilly-shallying.
And look here, Mr. Cheesacre, if it should ever come to pass that you
are making love to a lady in earnest--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't be more in earnest,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That you are making love to a lady in earnest, talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a little

night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we are friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes;--as good friends as ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div><p/>Cheesacre, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) drove himself home in the dark, tried to console
himself by thinking of the miserable plight in which Bellfield would
find himself at Norwich, with no possessions but what he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had brought
into the town that day in a small bag. But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) turned in at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
own gate he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) met two figures emerging; one of them was laden with a
portmanteau, and the other with a hat case.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only me, Cheesy, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div>said Bellfield. ``I've just come down
by the rail to fetch my things, and I'm going back to Norwich by the
9.20.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you've stolen anything of mine I'll have you prosecuted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>roared
Cheesacre, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) drove his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) gig up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) own door.




<p/>VOLUME II.

<p/>CHAPTER XLI.

<p/>A Noble Lord Dies.


<p/>George Vavasor remained about four days beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) grandfather's
roof; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was not happy there himself, nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) contribute to
the happiness of any one else. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) remained there in great discomfort
so long, being unwilling to leave till an answer had been received to
the request made to Aunt Greenow, in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) might insist on
Kate's performance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) promise with reference to Alice, if that
answer should be unfavourable. During these five days Kate did all
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) power to induce her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother to be, at any rate, kind in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
manner towards his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) grandfather, but it was in vain. The Squire would
not be the first to be gracious; and George, quite as obstinate as
the old man, would take no steps in that direction till encouraged
to do so by graciousness from the other side. Poor Kate entreated
each of them to begin, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) entreaties were of no avail. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is
an ill-mannered cub,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the old man said, <div class="bookquote">``and I was a fool to let him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
into the house. Don't mention his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) name to me again.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>George argued
the matter more at length. Kate spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own interest in
the matter, urging upon him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) might, by such conduct, drive the
Squire to exclude him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) altogether from the property.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) must do as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) likes,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>George said, sulkily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But for Alice's sake!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>Kate answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice would be the last to expect me to submit to unreasonable
ill-usage for the sake of money. As regards myself, I confess that
I'm very fond of money and am not particularly squeamish. I would
do anything that a man can do to secure it. But this I can't do. I
never injured him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and I never asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to injure himself. I never
attempted to borrow money from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I have never cost him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a shilling.
When I was in the wine business he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have enabled me to make a
large fortune simply by settling on me then the reversion of property
which, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dies, ought to be my own. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so perversely
ignorant that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would make no inquiry, but chose to think that I was
ruining myself, at the only time of my life when I was really doing
well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a right to act as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleased,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>urged Kate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no right to resent my asking such a
favour at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was an ignorant old fool not to do it; but
I should never have quarrelled with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on that account. Nature made
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a fool, and it wasn't his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fault. But I can't bring myself to
kneel in the dirt before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) simply because I asked for what was
reasonable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div><p/>The two men said very little to each other. They were never alone
together except during that half-hour after dinner in which they
were supposed to drink their wine. The old Squire always took three
glasses of port during this period, and expected that his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) grandson
would take three with him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). But George would drink none at all.
<div class="bookquote">``I have given up drinking wine after dinner,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), when his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
grandfather pushed the bottle over to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you mean that
you drink nothing but claret,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, in a tone of voice
that was certainly not conciliatory. <div class="bookquote">``I mean simply what I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said
George--<div class="bookquote">``that I have given up drinking wine after dinner.''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>The old
man could not openly quarrel with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heir on such a point as that.
Even Mr. Vavasor could not tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) grandson that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was going to the
dogs because he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had become temperate. But, nevertheless, there was
offence in it; and when George sat perfectly silent, looking at the
fire, evidently determined to make no attempt at conversation, the
offence grew, and became strong. <div class="bookquote">``What the devil's the use of your
sitting there if you neither drink nor talk?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man. <div class="bookquote">``No
use in the world, that I can see,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George; <div class="bookquote">``if, however, I were
to leave you, you would abuse me for it.''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't care how soon you
leave me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire. From all which it may be seen that George
Vavasor's visit to the hall of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) ancestors was not satisfactory.

<p/>On the fourth day, about noon, came Aunt Greenow's reply. <div class="bookquote">``Dearest
Kate,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am not going to do what you ask me,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--thus
rushing instantly into the middle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) subject.


<p/>You see, I don't know my nephew, and have no reason for
being specially anxious that he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) should be in Parliament.
I don't care two straws about the glory of the Vavasor
family. If I had never done anything for myself, the
Vavasors would have done very little for me. I don't care
much about what you call <div class="bookquote">``blood.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I like those who like
me, and whom I know. I am very fond of you, and because
you have been good to me I would give you a thousand
pounds if you wanted it for yourself; but I don't see why
I am to give my money to those I don't know. If it is
necessary to tell my nephew of this, pray tell him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) that I
mean no offence.

<p/>Your friend C. is still waiting--waiting--waiting,
patiently; but his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) patience may be exhausted.

<p/>Your affectionate aunt,

<p/>ARABELLA GREENOW.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) threw back the letter to
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sister. <div class="bookquote">``Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens, George! In the first place he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) does not want to marry

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And a very good place to have it,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Undoubtedly. But, really, you must not trouble yourself to talk

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only this,--that I should be very glad to see you well married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Should you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) close attachment to himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now, about the money,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``You must write to Alice at

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you must; you have promised. Indeed, it would have been

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the scar on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) face opened itself, and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sister stood before
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) in fear and trembling. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take my money now, and pay me out of hers as soon as you are

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is nonsense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should it be nonsense? Surely you need have no scruple with me.
I should have none with you if I wanted assistance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, Kate; I won't have it, and there's an end of it. All that
you have in the world would not pull me through this election, and
therefore such a loan would be worse than useless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And am I to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) for more than two thousand pounds?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) simply for one thousand. That is what I want, and
must have, at present. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) knows that I want it, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) is
to supply it; only she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) does not know that my need is so immediate.
That you must explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would sooner burn my hand, George!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But burning your hand, unfortunately, won't do any good. Look here,
Kate; I insist upon your doing this for me. If you do not, I shall
do it, of course, myself; but I shall regard your refusal as an
unjustifiable falsehood on your part, and shall certainly not see you
afterwards. I do not wish, for reasons which you may well understand,
to write to Alice myself on any subject at present. I now claim your
promise to do so; and if you refuse, I shall know very well what to
do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did not persist in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) refusal. With a sorrowful heart,
and with fingers that could hardly form the needful letters, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did
write a letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cousin, which explained the fact--that George
Vavasor immediately wanted a thousand pounds for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) electioneering
purposes. It was a stiff, uncomfortable letter, unnatural in
its phraseology, telling its own tale of grief and shame. Alice
understood very plainly all the circumstances under which it was
written, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sent back word to Kate at once, undertaking that the
money should be forthcoming; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) wrote again before the end of
January, saying that the sum named had been paid to George's credit
at his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own bankers.

<p/>Kate had taken immense pride in the renewal of the match between her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
brother and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cousin, and had rejoiced in it greatly as being her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
own work. But all that pride and joy were now over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) could no
longer write triumphant notes to Alice, speaking always of George as
one who was to be their joint hero, foretelling great things of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
career in Parliament, and saying little soft things of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) enduring
love. It was no longer possible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) now to write of George at all,
and it was equally impossible to Alice. Indeed, no letters passed
between them, when that monetary correspondence was over, up to the
end of the winter. Kate remained down in Westmoreland, wretched
and ill at ease, listening to hard words spoken by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) grandfather
against her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother, and feeling herself unable to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother's
part as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had been wont to do in other times.

<p/>George returned to town at the end of those four days, and found that
the thousand pounds was duly placed to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) credit before the end of
the month. It is hardly necessary to tell the reader that this money
had come from the stores of Mr. Tombe, and that Mr. Tombe duly debited
Mr. Grey with the amount. Alice, in accordance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) promise,
had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father that the money was needed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father, in
accordance with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) promise, had procured it without a word of
remonstrance. <div class="bookquote">``Surely I must sign some paper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice had said. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been contented when her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father told her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that the lawyers
would manage all that.

<p/>It was nearly the end of February when George Vavasor made his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) first
payment to Mr. Scruby on behalf of the coming election; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
called at Mr. Scruby's office with this object, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) received some
intelligence which surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) not a little. <div class="bookquote">``You haven't heard the
news,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Scruby. <div class="bookquote">``What news?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Marquis is as nearly off the hooks as a man can be.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>Mr. Scruby,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) communicated the tidings, showed clearly by his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) face and voice
that they were supposed to be of very great importance; but Vavasor
did not at first seem to be as much interested in the fate of <div class="bookquote">``the
Marquis''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>as Scruby had intended.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``Who is the Marquis? There'll
be sure to come another, so it don't much signify.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There will come another, and that's just it. It's the Marquis of
Bunratty; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) drops, our young Member will go into the Upper
House.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, immediately; before the end of the Session?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>George, of
course, knew well enough that such would be the case, but the effect
which this event would have upon himself now struck him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Scruby. <div class="bookquote">``The writ would be out immediately. I
should be glad enough of it, only that I know that Travers's people
have heard of it before us, and that they are ready to be up with
their posters directly the breath is out of the Marquis's body. We
must go to work immediately; that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will only be for part of a Session,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Scruby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And then there'll be the cost of another election.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Scruby; <div class="bookquote">``but in such cases we do manage to
make it come a little cheaper. If you lick Travers now, it may be
that you'll have a walk-over for the next.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you seen Grimes?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>asked George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have; the blackguard! He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) is going to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) house on
Travers's side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) came to me as bold as brass, and told me so,
saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) never liked gentlemen who kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>)
odd money. What angers me is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) ever got it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have not managed it very well, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor, looking
nastily at the attorney.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can't help those little accidents, Mr. Vavasor. There are worse
accidents than that turn up almost daily in my business. You may
think yourself almost lucky that I haven't gone over to Travers
myself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Travers</b></font>) is a Liberal, you know; and it hasn't been for want of an
offer, I can tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Vavasor was inclined to doubt the extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) luck in this respect,
and was almost disposed to repent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) Parliamentary ambition.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) would now be called upon to spend certainly not less than three
thousand pounds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) cousin's money on the chance of being able to
sit in Parliament for a few months. And then, after what a fashion
would he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) be compelled to negotiate that loan! He (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) might, to be sure,
allow the remainder of this Session to run, and stand, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) had
intended, at the general election; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) knew that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) now allowed
a Liberal to win the seat, the holder of the seat would be almost
sure of subsequent success. He (<font color='blue'><b>Liberal</b></font>) must either fight now, or give up the
fight altogether; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Liberal</b></font>) was a man who did not love to abandon any
contest in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Liberal</b></font>) had been engaged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Squire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Scruby, <div class="bookquote">``how is it to be?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>And Vavasor felt
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) detected in the man's voice some diminution of that respect
with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) had hitherto been treated as a paying candidate for a
metropolitan borough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This lord is not dead yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)'s not dead yet, that we have heard; but it won't do for us to
wait. We want every minute of time that we can get. There isn't any
hope for him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), I'm told. It's gout in the stomach, or dropsy at the
heart, or some of those things that make a fellow safe to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It won't do to wait for the next election?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you ask me, I should say certainly not. Indeed, I shouldn't wish
to have to conduct it under such circumstances. I hate a fight when
there's no chance of success. I grudge spending a man's money in such
a case; I do indeed, Mr. Vavasor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose Grimes's going over won't make much difference?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The blackguard! He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>)'ll take a hundred and fifty votes, I suppose;
perhaps more. But that is not much in such a constituency as the
Chelsea districts. You see, Travers played mean at the last election,
and that will be against him (<font color='blue'><b>Travers</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the Conservatives will have a candidate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no knowing; but I don't think they will. They'll try one
at the general, no doubt; but if the two sitting Members can pull
together, they won't have much of a chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Vavasor found himself compelled to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) would stand; and
Scruby undertook to give the initiatory orders at once, not waiting
even till the Marquis should be dead. <div class="bookquote">``We should have our houses open
as soon as theirs,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``There's a deal in that.''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>So George
Vavasor gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) orders. <div class="bookquote">``If the worst comes to the worst,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) said
to himself, <div class="bookquote">``I can always cut my throat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) walked from the attorney's office to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) club he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) bethought
himself that that might not unprobably be the necessary termination
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) career. Everything was going wrong with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) grandfather,
who was eighty years of age, would not die,--appeared to have no
symptoms of dying;--whereas this Marquis, who was not yet much over
fifty, was rushing headlong out of the world, simply because he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was
the one man whose continued life at the present moment would be
serviceable to George Vavasor. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) grandfather he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
almost broke his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) umbrella by the vehemence with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) struck it
against the pavement. What right could an ignorant old fool like that
have to live for ever, keeping the possession of a property which
he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) could not use, and ruining those who were to come after him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)? If
now, at this moment, that wretched place down in Westmoreland could
become his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) might yet ride triumphantly over his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) difficulties, and
refrain from sullying his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) hands with more of his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) cousin's money till
she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) should become his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) wife.

<p/>Even that thousand pounds had not passed through his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) hands without
giving him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) much bitter suffering. As is always the case in such
matters, the thing done was worse than the doing of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had taught
himself to look at it lightly whilst it was yet unaccomplished; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) could not think of it lightly now. Kate had been right. It would
have been better for him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) money. Any money would have been
better than that upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had laid his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) sacrilegious hands. If
he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) could have cut a purse, after the old fashion, the stain of the
deed would hardly have been so deep. In these days,--for more than
a month, indeed, after his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) return from Westmoreland,--he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) did not go
near Queen Anne Street, trying to persuade himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) stayed
away because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) coldness to him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>). But, in truth, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was afraid of
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) without speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) money, and afraid to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
were to speak of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have seen the _Globe_?''  (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>someone said to him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) entered the
club.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed; I have seen nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bunratty died in Ireland this morning. I suppose you'll be up for
the Chelsea districts?''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XLII.

<p/>Parliament Meets.


<p/>Parliament opened that year on the twelfth of February, and Mr.
Palliser was one of the first Members of the Lower House to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
seat. It had been generally asserted through the country, during the
last week, that the existing Chancellor of the Exchequer had, so to
say, ceased to exist as such; that though he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) still existed to the
outer world, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) salary, and doing routine work,--if a man
so big can have any routine work to do,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) existed no longer in
the inner world of the cabinet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) had differed, men said, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) friend and chief, the Prime Minister, as to the expediency of
repealing what were left of the direct taxes of the country, and was
prepared to launch himself into opposition with his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) small bodyguard
of followers, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) energy and with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) venom.

<p/>There is something very pleasant in the close, bosom friendship, and
bitter, uncompromising animosity, of these human gods,--of these
human beings who would be gods were they not shorn so short of their
divinity in that matter of immortality. If it were so arranged that
the same persons were always friends, and the same persons were
always enemies, as used to be the case among the dear old heathen
gods and goddesses;--if Parliament were an Olympus in which Juno and
Venus never kissed, the thing would not be nearly so interesting. But
in this Olympus partners are changed, the divine bosom, now rabid
with hatred against some opposing deity, suddenly becomes replete
with love towards its late enemy, and exciting changes occur which
give to the whole thing all the keen interest of a sensational novel.
No doubt this is greatly lessened for those who come too near the
scene of action. Members of Parliament, and the friends of Members
of Parliament, are apt to teach themselves that it means nothing;
that Lord This does not hate Mr. That, or think him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) a traitor to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
country, or wish to crucify him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>); and that Sir John of the Treasury
is not much in earnest when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) speaks of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) noble friend at the
<div class="bookquote">``Foreign Office''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>as a god to whom no other god was ever comparable in
honesty, discretion, patriotism, and genius. But the outside Briton
who takes a delight in politics,--and this description should include
ninety-nine educated Englishmen out of every hundred,--should not be
desirous of peeping behind the scenes. No beholder at any theatre
should do so. It is good to believe in these friendships and these
enmities, and very pleasant to watch their changes. It is delightful
when Oxford embraces Manchester, finding that it cannot live without
support in that quarter; and very delightful when the uncompromising
assailant of all men in power receives the legitimate reward of his (<font color='blue'><b>assailant</b></font>)
energy by being taken in among the bosoms of the blessed.

<p/>But although the outer world was so sure that the existing Chancellor
of the Exchequer had ceased to exist, when the House of Commons met
that gentleman took his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) seat on the Treasury Bench. Mr. Palliser, who
had by no means given a general support to the Ministry in the last
Session, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) seat on the same side of the House indeed, but low
down, and near to the cross benches. Mr. Bott sat close behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>),
and men knew that Mr. Bott was a distinguished member of Mr. Palliser's
party, whatever that party might be. Lord Cinquebars moved the
Address, and I must confess that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cinquebars</b></font>) did it very lamely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cinquebars</b></font>) was
once accused by Mr. Maxwell, the brewer, of making a great noise in
the hunting-field. The accusation could not be repeated as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cinquebars</b></font>)
performance on this occasion, as no one could hear a word that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cinquebars</b></font>)
said. The Address was seconded by Mr. Loftus Fitzhoward, a nephew of
the Duke of St. Bungay, who spoke as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) were resolved to trump
poor Lord Cinquebars in every sentence which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) pronounced,--as we
so often hear the second clergyman from the Communion Table trumping
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) weary predecessor, who has just finished the Litany not in the
clearest or most audible voice. Every word fell from Mr. Fitzhoward
with the elaborate accuracy of a separate pistol-shot; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzhoward</b></font>)
became pleased with himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzhoward</b></font>) progress, and warm with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzhoward</b></font>) work,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzhoward</b></font>) accented his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzhoward</b></font>) words sharply, made rhetorical pauses, even moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzhoward</b></font>)
hands about in action, and quite disgusted his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzhoward</b></font>) own party, who had
been very well satisfied with Lord Cinquebars. There are many rocks
which a young speaker in Parliament should avoid, but no rock which
requires such careful avoiding as the rock of eloquence. Whatever
may be his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) faults, let him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) at least avoid eloquence. He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) should
not be inaccurate, which, however, is not much; he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) should not be
long-winded, which is a good deal; he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) should not be ill-tempered,
which is more; but none of these faults are so damnable as eloquence.
All Mr. Fitzhoward's friends and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzhoward</b></font>) enemies knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzhoward</b></font>) had had
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzhoward</b></font>) chance, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzhoward</b></font>) had thrown it away.

<p/>In the Queen's Speech there had been some very lukewarm allusion to
remission of direct taxation. This remission, which had already been
carried so far, should be carried further if such further carrying
were found practicable. So had said the Queen. Those words, it was
known, could not have been approved of by the energetic and still
existing Chancellor of the Exchequer. On this subject the mover
of the Address said never a word, and the seconder only a word or
two. What they had said had, of course, been laid down for them;
though, unfortunately, the manner of saying could not be so easily
prescribed. Then there arose a great enemy, a man fluent of diction,
apparently with deep malice at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart, though at home,--as we used
to say at school,--one of the most good-natured fellows in the world;
one ambitious of that godship which a seat on the other side of
the House bestowed, and greedy to grasp at the chances which this
disagreement in the councils of the gods might give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was quite
content, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, to vote for the Address, as, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed, would be
all the gentlemen on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side of the House. No one could suspect them
or him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of giving a factious opposition to Government. Had they not
borne and forborne beyond all precedent known in that House? Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) touched lightly, and almost with grace to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opponents, on many
subjects, promising support, and barely hinting that they were
totally and manifestly wrong in all things. But--. Then the tone of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice changed, and the well-known look of fury was assumed upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) countenance. Then great Jove on the other side pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat
over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, and smiled blandly. Then members put away the papers
they had been reading for a moment, and men in the gallery began
to listen. But--. The long and the short of it was this; that the
existing Government had come into power on the cry of a reduction
of taxation, and now they were going to shirk the responsibility
of their own measures. They were going to shirk the responsibility
of their own election cry, although it was known that their own
Chancellor of the Exchequer was prepared to carry it out to the full.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) was willing to carry it out to the full were he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) not restrained by
the timidity, falsehood, and treachery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) colleagues, of whom,
of course, the most timid, the most false, and the most treacherous
was--the great god Jove, who sat blandly smiling on the other side.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: Great Jove.-RSB-


<p/>No one should ever go near the House of Commons who wishes to enjoy
all this. It was so manifestly evident that neither Jove nor any
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) satellites cared twopence for what the irate gentleman was
saying; nay, it became so evident that, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) assumed fury,
the gentleman was not irate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) intended to communicate his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) look
of anger to the newspaper reports of his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) speech; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) knew from
experience that he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) could succeed in that. And men walked about the
House in the most telling moments,--enemies shaking hands with
enemies,--in a way that showed an entire absence of all good, honest
hatred among them. But the gentleman went on and finished his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) speech,
demanding at last, in direct terms, that the Treasury Jove should
state plainly to the House who was to be, and who was not to be, the
bearer of the purse among the gods.

<p/>Then Treasury Jove got up smiling, and thanked his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) enemy for the
cordiality of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) support. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had always,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``done the
gentleman's party justice for their clemency, and had feared no
opposition from them; and he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was glad to find that he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was correct in
his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) anticipations as to the course they would pursue on the present
occasion.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) went on saying a good deal about home matters, and
foreign matters, proving that everything was right, just as easily as
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) enemy had proved that everything was wrong. On all these points
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was very full, and very courteous; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) came to the subject
of taxation, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) simply repeated the passage from the Queen's Speech,
expressing a hope that his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) right honourable friend, the Chancellor of
the Exchequer, would be able to satisfy the judgement of the House,
and the wishes of the people. That specially personal question which
had been asked he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did not answer at all.

<p/>But the House was still all agog, as was the crowded gallery. The
energetic and still existing Chancellor of the Exchequer was then
present, divided only by one little thin Secretary of State from Jove
himself. Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) get up and declare his (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) purposes? He (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) was a man who
almost always did get up when an opportunity offered itself,--or when
it did not. Some second little gun was fired off from the Opposition
benches, and then there was a pause. Would the purse-bearer of
Olympus rise upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) wings and speak his (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) mind, or would he (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) sit
in silence upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) cloud? There was a general call for the
purse-bearer, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) floated in silence, and was inexplicable. The
purse-bearer was not to be bullied into any sudden reading of the
riddle. Then there came on a general debate about money matters, in
which the purse-bearer did say a few words, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) said nothing as
to the great question at issue. At last up got Mr. Palliser, towards
the close of the evening, and occupied a full hour in explaining what
taxes the Government might remit with safety, and what they might
not,--Mr. Bott, meanwhile, prompting him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) with figures from behind
with an assiduity that was almost too persistent. According to Mr.
Palliser, the words used in the Queen's Speech were not at all too
cautious. The Members went out gradually, and the House became very
thin during this oration; but the newspapers declared, next morning,
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) speech had been the speech of the night, and that the
perspicuity of Mr. Palliser pointed him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) out as the coming man.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) returned home to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) house in Park Lane quite triumphant after his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
success, and found Lady Glencora, at about twelve o'clock, sitting
alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had arrived in town on that day, having come up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) own
request, instead of remaining at Matching Priory till after Easter,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had proposed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) to stay, in order, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
had said, that there might be a home for his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) cousins. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had
expressed herself unwilling to remain without him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), explaining that
the cousins might have the home in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) absence, as well as they
could in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) presence; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had given way. But, in truth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had
learned to hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) cousin Iphy Palliser with a hatred that was
unreasonable,--seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) did not also hate Alice Vavasor, who
had done as much to merit her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) hatred as had her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) cousin. Lady Glencora
knew by what means her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) absence from Monkshade had been brought about.
Miss Palliser had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) all that had passed in Alice's bedroom
on the last night of Alice's stay at Matching, and had, by so doing,
contrived to prevent the visit. Lady Glencora understood well all
that Alice had said: and yet, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hated Miss Palliser for what
had been done, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) entertained no anger against Alice. Of course
Alice would have prevented that visit to Monkshade if it were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
power to do so. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would save her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) friend. It is hardly
too much to say that Lady Glencora looked to Alice to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).
Nevertheless she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hated Iphy Palliser for engaging herself in the same
business. Lady Glencora looked to Alice to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and yet it may
be doubted whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did, in truth, wish to be saved.

<p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was at Matching, and before Mr. Palliser had returned from
Monkshade, a letter reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), by what means she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had never learned.
<div class="bookquote">``A letter has been placed within my writing-case,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
maid, quite openly. <div class="bookquote">``Who put it there?''  (<font color='red'><b>The maid</b></font>)</div>The maid had declared her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
ignorance in a manner that had satisfied Lady Glencora of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) truth.
<div class="bookquote">``If such a thing happens again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, <div class="bookquote">``I shall be
obliged to have the matter investigated. I cannot allow that anything
should be put into my room surreptitiously.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>There, then, had been an
end of that, as regarded any steps taken by Lady Glencora. The letter
had been from Burgo Fitzgerald, and had contained a direct proposal
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) should go off with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am at Matching,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the letter said,
<div class="bookquote">``at the Inn; but I do not dare to show myself, lest I should do you
an injury. I walked round the house yesterday, at night, and I know
that I saw your room. If I am wrong in thinking that you love me, I
would not for worlds insult you by my presence; but if you love me
still, I ask you to throw aside from you that fictitious marriage,
and give yourself to the man whom, if you love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), you should regard
as your husband.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There had been more of it, but it had been to the
same effect. To Lady Glencora it had seemed to convey an assurance
of devoted love,--of that love which, in former days, her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) friends
had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was not within the compass of Burgo's nature. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had
not asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) then, but saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) would return to
Matching after Parliament was met, begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) have some
means of knowing whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) heart was true to him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) told no one of the letter, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) kept it, and read it over and
over again in the silence and solitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
was guilty in thus reading it,--even in keeping it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband's
knowledge; but though conscious of this guilt, though resolute
almost in its commission, still she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) determined not to remain at
Matching after her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband's departure,--not to undergo the danger
of remaining there while Burgo Fitzgerald should be in the vicinity.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could not analyse her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) own wishes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) often told herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
had told Alice, that it would be better for them all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should
go away; that in throwing herself even to the dogs, if such must be
the result, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would do more of good than of harm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) declared to
herself, in the most passionate words she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could use, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) loved
this man with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) protested that the fault would not
be hers, but theirs, who had forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to marry the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did
not love. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) assured herself that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) husband had no affection for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and that their marriage was in every respect prejudicial to
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) recurred over and over again, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thoughts, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own
childlessness, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) extreme desire for an heir. <div class="bookquote">``Though I do
sacrifice myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``I shall do more of good than harm,
and I cannot be more wretched than I am now.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) fled to
London because she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) feared to leave herself at Matching when Burgo
Fitzgerald should be there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sent no answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) letter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
made no preparation for going with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) longed to see Alice, to
whom alone, since her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) marriage, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ever spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) love, and
intended to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) the whole tale of that letter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was as one
who, in madness, was resolute to throw herself from a precipice, but
to whom some remnant of sanity remained which forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to seek
those who would save her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) from herself.

<p/>Mr. Palliser had not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) since her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) arrival in London, and,
of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) by the hand and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). But it was the
embrace of a brother rather than of a lover or a husband. Lady
Glencora, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) full woman's nature, understood this thoroughly,
and appreciated by instinct the true bearing of every touch from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
hand. <div class="bookquote">``I hope you are well?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes; quite well. And you? A little fatigued with your journey, I
suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we have had a debate on the Address. Don't you want to know
how it has gone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it has concerned you particularly, I do, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Concerned me! It has concerned me certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They haven't appointed you yet; have they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; they don't appoint people during debates, in the House of
Commons. But I fear I shall never make you a politician.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm almost afraid you never will. But I'm not the less anxious for
your success, since you wish it yourself. I don't understand why you
should work so very hard; but, as you like it, I'm as anxious as
anybody can be that you should triumph.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I do like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``A man must like something, and I don't
know what there is to like better. Some people can eat and drink all
day; and some people can care about a horse. I can do neither.''

 (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div><p/>And there were others, Lady Glencora thought, who could love to lie
in the sun, and could look up into the eyes of women, and seek their
happiness there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was sure, at any rate, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) knew one such.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said nothing of this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I spoke for a moment to Lord Brock,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser. Lord Brock
was the name by which the present Jove of the Treasury was known
among men.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what did Lord Brock say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) didn't say much, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) was very cordial.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I thought, Plantagenet, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) could appoint you if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) pleased?
Doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) do it all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, in one sense, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) does. But I don't suppose I shall ever make
you understand.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) endeavoured, however, to do so on the present
occasion, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) a somewhat longer lecture on the working of
the British Constitution, and the manner in which British politics
evolved themselves, than would have been expected from most young
husbands to their young wives under similar circumstances. Lady
Glencora yawned, and strove lustily, but ineffectually, to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
yawn in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) handkerchief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I see you don't care a bit about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>), peevishly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be angry, Plantagenet. Indeed I do care about it, but I am so
ignorant that I can't understand it all at once. I am rather tired,
and I think I'll go to bed now. Shall you be late?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not very; that is, I shall be rather late. I've a lot of
letters I want to write to-night, as I must be at work all to-morrow.
By-the-by, Mr. Bott is coming to dine here. There will be no one
else.''  (<font color='red'><b>House/House of Commons</b></font>)</div>The next day was a Wednesday, and the House would not sit in
the evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bott!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, showing by her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) voice that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
anticipated no pleasure from that gentleman's company.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. Bott. Have you any objection?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no. Would you like to dine alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I dine alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>)? Why shouldn't you eat your dinner
with us? I hope you are not going to become fastidious, and to turn
up your nose at people. Mrs. Marsham is in town, and I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>)'ll
come to you if you ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/>But this was too much for Lady Glencora. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was disposed to be mild,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could not endure to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) two duennas thus brought upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) together on the first day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) arrival in London. And Mrs.
Marsham would be worse than Mr. Bott. Mr. Bott would be engaged with
Mr. Palliser during the greater part of the evening. <div class="bookquote">``I thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``of asking my cousin, Alice Vavasor, to spend the evening with
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Vavasor!''  (<font color='red'><b>the husband</b></font>)</div>said the husband. <div class="bookquote">``I must say that I thought Miss
Vavasor--''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was going to make some allusion to that unfortunate
hour spent among the ruins, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stopped himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you have nothing to say against my cousin?''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) is my only near relative that I really care for;--the only
woman, I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I don't mean to say anything against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s very well as a
young lady, I dare say. I would sooner that you would ask Mrs. Marsham
to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Glencora was standing, waiting to go away to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) own room, but
it was absolutely necessary that this matter should be decided before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) went. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was hard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), and unreasonable, and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was treating her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) like a child who should not be allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
own way in anything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had endeavoured to please him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and, having
failed, was not now disposed to give way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As there will be no other ladies here to-morrow evening,
Plantagenet, and as I have not yet seen Alice since I have been in
town, I wish you would let me have my way in this. Of course I cannot
have very much to say to Mrs. Marsham, who is an old woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I especially want Mrs. Marsham to be your friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Friendships will not come by ordering, Plantagenet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>).


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``Friendships will not come by ordering,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Of course, you will do as you please. I am
sorry that you have refused the first favour I have asked you this
year.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) left the room, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) went away to bed.




<p/>CHAPTER XLIII.

<p/>Mrs. Marsham.


<p/>But Lady Glencora was not brought to repentance by her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband's last
words. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) to be so intolerably cruel, this demand of
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) should be made to pass the whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) first evening
in town with an old woman for whom it was impossible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) should
entertain the slightest regard, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) resolved upon rebellion. Had
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) positively ordered Mrs. Marsham, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) would have sent for that lady,
and have contented herself with enduring her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) presence in disdainful
silence; but Mr. Palliser had not given any order. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had made a
request, and a request, from its very nature, admits of no obedience.
The compliance with a request must be voluntary, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) would not
send for Mrs. Marsham, except upon compulsion. Had not she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) also made
a request to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), and had not he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) refused it? It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) prerogative,
undoubtedly, to command; but in that matter of requests she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) had a
right to expect that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) voice should be as potent as his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>)
wrote a line, therefore, to Alice before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went to bed, begging her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
cousin to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) early on the following day, so that they might
go out together, and then afterwards dine in company with Mr. Bott.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that will be an inducement to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora said,
<div class="bookquote">``because your generous heart will feel of what service you may be to
me. Nobody else will be here,--unless, indeed, Mrs. Marsham should be
asked, unknown to myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) sat herself down to think,--to think especially about the
cruelty of husbands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had been told over and over again, in the
days before her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) marriage, that Burgo would ill-use her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) became
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband. The Marquis of Auld Reekie had gone so far as to suggest
that Burgo might probably beat her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>). But what hard treatment, even
what beating, could be so unendurable as this total want of sympathy,
as this deadness in life, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) present lot entailed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)? As
for that matter of beating, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) ridiculed the idea in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) very soul.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) sat smiling at the absurdity of the thing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) thought of the
beauty of Burgo's eyes, of the softness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) touch, of the loving,
almost worshipping, tones of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) voice. Would it not even be better
to be beaten by him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) than to have politics explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) at one
o'clock at night by such a husband as Plantagenet Palliser? The
British Constitution, indeed! Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) married Burgo they would have
been in sunny Italy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) would have told her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) some other tale than
that as they sat together under the pale moonlight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had a little
water-coloured drawing called Raphael and Fornarina, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was
infantine enough to tell herself that the so-called Raphael was like
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) Burgo--no, not her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) Burgo, but the Burgo that was not hers. At any
rate, all the romance of the picture she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) might have enjoyed had they
allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) to dispose as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had wished of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) own hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) might
have sat in marble balconies, while the vines clustered over her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
head, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) would have been at her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) knee, hardly speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>),
but making his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) presence felt by the halo of its divinity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) would
have called upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) for no hard replies. With him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) near her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would
have enjoyed the soft air, and would have sat happy, without trouble,
lapped in the delight of loving. It was thus that Fornarina sat. And
why should not such a lot have been hers? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) Raphael would have
loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), let them say what they would about his (<font color='blue'><b>Raphael</b></font>) cruelty.

<p/>Poor, wretched, overburthened child, to whom the commonest lessons of
life had not yet been taught, and who had now fallen into the hands
of one who was so ill-fitted to teach them! Who would not pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)?
Who could say that the fault was hers? The world had laden her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) with
wealth till she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had had no limb free for its ordinary uses, and then
had turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) loose to run her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) race!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you written to your cousin?''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) the next
morning. His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) voice, as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) spoke, clearly showed that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) anger was
either over or suppressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I have asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) to come and drive, and then to stay for
dinner. I shall send the carriage for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) can come. The man is
to wait for an answer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser, mildly. And then, after a short pause,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``As that is settled, perhaps you would have no objection to
ask Mrs. Marsham also?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) probably be engaged?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I think not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) added, being ashamed
of the tinge of falsehood of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would otherwise have been
guilty, <div class="bookquote">``I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) is not engaged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) expects to come, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>), if you mean that, Glencora. Had I done so,
I should have said so. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) that I did not know what your
engagements were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), if you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wife</b></font>)</div>said the wife, who felt that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could hardly refuse any longer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>the husband</b></font>)</div>said the husband. So Lady Glencora did write to Mrs.
Marsham, who promised to come,--as did also Alice Vavasor.

<p/>Lady Glencora would, at any rate, have Alice to herself for some
hours before dinner. At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) took comfort in that reflection;
but after a while she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) bethought herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would not know
what to tell Alice, or what not to tell. Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mean to show that
letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin? If she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did show it, then,--so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) argued with
herself,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) must bring herself to endure the wretchedness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
present lot, and must give up for ever all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) dreams about Raphael
and Fornarina. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not show it,--or, at any rate, tell of
it,--then it would come to pass that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) husband
under the protection of another man, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would become--what she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
did not dare to name even to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) declared that so it must
be. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would go with Burgo, should he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) ever come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
with the means of going at his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) instant command. But should
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) bring herself to let Alice know that such a letter had been
conveyed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), Burgo would never have such power.

<p/>I remember the story of a case of abduction in which a man was tried
for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life, and was acquitted, because the lady had acquiesced in
the carrying away while it was in progress. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) herself
declared, armed herself with a sure and certain charm or talisman
against such dangers, which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) kept suspended round her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) neck; but
whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was in the post-chaise she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) opened the window and threw
the charm from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), no longer desiring, as the learned counsel for
the defence efficiently alleged, to be kept under the bonds of such
protection. Lady Glencora's state of mind was, in its nature, nearly
the same as that of the lady in the post-chaise. Whether or no she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
would use her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) charm, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had not yet decided, but the power of doing
so was still hers.

<p/>Alice came, and the greeting between the cousins was very
affectionate. Lady Glencora received her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) as though they had been
playmates from early childhood; and Alice, though such impulsive love
was not natural to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) as to the other, could not bring herself to
be cold to one who was so warm to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). Indeed, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) not promised
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) love in that meeting at Matching Priory in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin
had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wretchedness? <div class="bookquote">``I will love you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice had
said; and though there was much in Lady Glencora that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could not
approve,--much even that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could not bring herself to like,--still
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would not allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) heart to contradict her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) words.

<p/>They sat so long over the fire in the drawing-room that at last they
agreed that the driving should be abandoned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the use of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``There's nothing to see,
and the wind is as cold as charity. We are much more comfortable
here; are we not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice quite acquiesced in this, having no great
desire to be driven through the parks in the gloom of a February
afternoon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had Dandy and Flirt up here, there would be some fun in it; but
Mr. Palliser doesn't wish me to drive in London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it would be dangerous?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least. I don't think it's that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) minds; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) has an
idea that it looks fast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it does. If I were a man, I'm sure I shouldn't like my wife to
drive horses about London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why not? Just because you'd be a tyrant,--like other husbands?
What's the harm of looking fast, if one doesn't do anything improper?
Poor Dandy, and dear Flirt! I'm sure they'd like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps Mr. Palliser doesn't care for that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can tell you something else he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) doesn't care for. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) doesn't care
whether Dandy's mistress likes it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say that, Glencora.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not say it,--to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't teach yourself to think it. That's what I mean. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>)
would consent to anything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>) didn't think wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Such as lectures about the British Constitution! But never mind
about that, Alice. Of course the British Constitution is everything
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>), and I wish I knew more about it;--that's all. But I haven't
told you whom you are to meet at dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you have--Mr. Bott.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there's another guest, a Mrs. Marsham. I thought I'd got rid of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) for to-day, when I wrote to you; but I hadn't. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>)'s coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) won't hurt me at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) will hurt me very much. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>)'ll destroy the pleasure of our whole
evening. I do believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) hates you, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) thinks you
instigate me to all manner of iniquity. What fools they all are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are they all, Glencora?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) and that man, and--. Never mind. It makes me sick when I think
that they should be so blind. Alice, I hardly know how much I owe to
you; I don't, indeed. Everything, I believe.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
spoke, put her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) hand into her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) pocket, and grasped the letter which lay
there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; it's not nonsense. Who do you think came to Matching when I was
there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What;--to the house?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, feeling almost certain that Mr.
Fitzgerald was the person to whom Lady Glencora was alluding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not to the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it is the person of whom I am thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, solemnly,
<div class="bookquote">``let me implore you not to speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why should I not speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)? Did I not speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) before to
you, and was it not for good? How are you to be my friend, if I may
not speak to you of everything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you should not think of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What nonsense you talk, Alice! Not think of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)! How is one to help
one's thoughts? Look here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand was on the letter, and it would have been out in a moment,
and thrown upon Alice's lap, had not the servant opened the door and
announced Mrs. Marsham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how I do wish we had gone to drive!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, in a
voice which the servant certainly heard, and which Mrs. Marsham would
have heard had she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) not been a little hard of hearing,--in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) bonnet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marsham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Marsham. <div class="bookquote">``I thought I'd just come across
from Norfolk Street and see you, though I am coming to dinner in the
evening. It's only just a step, you know. How d'ye do, Miss Vavasor?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) made a salutation to Alice which was nearly as cold as it
could be.

<p/>Mrs. Marsham was a woman who had many good points. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) was poor,
and bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) poverty without complaint She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) was connected by blood
and friendship with people rich and titled; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) paid to none of
them egregious respect on account of their wealth or titles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) was
staunch in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) friendships, and staunch in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) enmities. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) was
no fool, and knew well what was going on in the world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) could
talk about the last novel, or--if need be--about the Constitution.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) had been a true wife, though sometimes too strong-minded, and a
painstaking mother, whose children, however, had never loved her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as
most mothers like to be loved.

<p/>The catalogue of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) faults must be quite as long as that of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
virtues. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was one of those women who are ambitious of power, and
not very scrupulous as to the manner in which they obtain it. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
was hardhearted, and capable of pursuing an object without much
regard to the injury she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might do. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would not flatter wealth or
fawn before a title, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was not above any artifice by which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
might ingratiate herself with those whom it suited her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) purpose to
conciliate. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought evil rather than good. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was herself untrue
in action, if not absolutely in word. I do not say that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would
coin lies, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would willingly leave false impressions. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had
been the bosom friend, and in many things the guide in life, of Mr.
Palliser's mother; and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) took a special interest in Mr. Palliser's
welfare. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) married, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heard the story of the loves of Burgo
and Lady Glencora; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) thought well of the money, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
was not disposed to think very well of the bride. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
mind that the young lady would want watching, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was of opinion
that no one would be so well able to watch Lady Glencora as herself.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had not plainly opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) mind on this matter to Mr. Palliser;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had not made any distinct suggestion to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would act
as Argus to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife. Mr. Palliser would have rejected any such
suggestion, and Mrs. Marsham knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would do so; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>)
had let a word or two drop, hinting that Lady Glencora was very
young,--hinting that Lady Glencora's manners were charming in their
childlike simplicity; but hinting also that precaution was, for that
reason, the more necessary. Mr. Palliser, who suspected nothing as
to Burgo or as to any other special peril, whose whole disposition
was void of suspicion, whose dry nature realized neither the delights
nor the dangers of love, acknowledged that Glencora was young. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
especially wished that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) should be discreet and matronly; he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) feared
no lovers, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) feared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) might do silly things,--that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would catch cold,--and not know how to live a life becoming
the wife of a Chancellor of the Exchequer. Therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) submitted
Glencora,--and, to a certain extent, himself,--into the hands of Mrs.
Marsham.

<p/>Lady Glencora had not been twenty-four hours in the house with this
lady before she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) recognized in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) a duenna. In all such matters no
one could be quicker than Lady Glencora. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) might be very ignorant
about the British Constitution, and, alas! very ignorant also as to
the real elements of right and wrong in a woman's conduct, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was no fool. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had an eye that could see, and an ear that could
understand, and an abundance of that feminine instinct which teaches
a woman to know her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) friend or her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) enemy at a glance, at a touch, at
a word. In many things Lady Glencora was much quicker, much more
clever, than her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband, though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was to be Chancellor of the
Exchequer, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) did know nothing of the Constitution.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) knew, too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was easily to be deceived,--that though his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
intelligence was keen, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) instincts were dull,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was gifted
with no fineness of touch, with no subtle appreciation of the
characters of men and women; and, to a certain extent, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) looked
down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) obtusity. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should have been aware that Burgo
was a danger to be avoided; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) should have been aware also that
Mrs. Marsham was a duenna not to be employed. When a woman knows that
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is guarded by a watch-dog, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is bound to deceive her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Cerberus,
if it be possible, and is usually not ill-disposed to deceive also
the owner of Cerberus. Lady Glencora felt that Mrs. Marsham was her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
Cerberus, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was heartily resolved that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was to be kept in
the proper line at all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would not be so kept by Mrs. Marsham.

<p/>Alice rose and accepted Mrs. Marsham's salutation quite as coldly as
it had been given, and from that time forward those two ladies were
enemies. Mrs. Marsham, groping quite in the dark, partly guessed that
Alice had in some way interfered to prevent Lady Glencora's visit to
Monkshade, and, though such prevention was, no doubt, good in that
lady's eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) resented the interference. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mind
that Alice was not the sort of friend that Lady Glencora should have
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>). Alice recognized and accepted the feud.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought I might find you at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marsham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Marsham, <div class="bookquote">``as I know
you are lazy about going out in the cold,--unless it be for a foolish
midnight ramble,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marsham</b></font>)</div>and Mrs. Marsham shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) was a little
woman, with sharp small eyes, with a permanent colour in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) face,
and two short, crisp, grey curls at each side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) face; always
well dressed, always in good health, and, as Lady Glencora believed,
altogether incapable of fatigue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The ramble you speak of was very wise, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora;
<div class="bookquote">``but I never could see the use of driving about in London in the
middle of winter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One ought to go out of the house every day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marsham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Marsham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate all those rules. Don't you, Alice?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice did not hate them,
therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) said nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Glencora, one must live by rules in this life. You might as
well say that you hated sitting down to dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I do, very often; almost always when there's company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll get over that feeling after another season in town,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marsham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Marsham, pretending to suppose that Lady Glencora alluded to some
remaining timidity in receiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) own guests.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word I don't think I shall. It's a thing that seems always
to be getting more grievous, instead of less so. Mr. Bott is coming to
dine here to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no mistaking the meaning of this. There was no pretending
even to mistake it. Now, Mrs. Marsham had accepted the right hand
of fellowship from Mr. Bott,--not because she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) especially liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>),
but in compliance with the apparent necessities of Mr. Palliser's
position. Mr. Bott had made good his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) ground about Mr. Palliser; and Mrs.
Marsham, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) was not strong enough to turn him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) off from it, had
given him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) the right hand of fellowship.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bott is a Member of Parliament, and a very serviceable friend of
Mr. Palliser's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marsham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Marsham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All the same; we do not like Mr. Bott--do we, Alice? He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) is Doctor
Fell to us; only I think we could tell why.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly do not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It can be but of small matter to you, Miss Vavasor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marsham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Marsham, <div class="bookquote">``as you will not probably have to see much of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marsham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of the very smallest moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) did annoy me once, but
will never, I dare say, have an opportunity of doing so again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what the annoyance may have been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you don't, Mrs. Marsham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I shouldn't have thought it likely that a person so fully
employed as Mr. Bott, and employed, too, on matters of such vast
importance, would have gone out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) way to annoy a young lady whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) chanced to meet for a day or two in a country-house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think that Alice means that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) attempted to flirt with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``Fancy Mr. Bott's flirtation!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) did not attempt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marsham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Marsham; and the words, the
tone, and the innuendo together were more than Alice was able to bear
with equanimity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Glencora,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), rising from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) chair, <div class="bookquote">``I think I'll leave
you alone with Mrs. Marsham. I'm not disposed to discuss Mr. Bott's
character, and certainly not to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) name mentioned in
disagreeable connection with my own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But Lady Glencora would not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) go. <div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``If you and I can't fight our little battles against Mr. Bott and Mrs.
Marsham without running away, it is odd. There is a warfare in which
they who run away never live to fight another day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope, Glencora, you do not count me as your enemy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marsham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Marsham, drawing herself up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I shall,--certainly, if you attack Alice. Love me, love my dog.
I beg your pardon, Alice; but what I meant was this, Mrs. Marsham;
Love me, love the best friend I have in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not mean to offend Miss Vavasor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marsham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Marsham, looking at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) very grimly. Alice merely bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been offended,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would not deny it. After that, Mrs. Marsham took herself
off, saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) would be back to dinner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) was angry, but
not unhappy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) could put down Miss Vavasor, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was prepared to bear a good deal from Lady Glencora--for Mr.
Palliser's sake, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said to herself, with some attempt at a
sentimental remembrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) old friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>)'s a nasty old cat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, as soon as the door was
closed; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said these words with so droll a voice, with such a
childlike shaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) head, with so much comedy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) grimace,
that Alice could not but laugh. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``I know
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>), and you'll have to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>), too, before you've done with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>).
It won't at all do for you to run away when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) spits at you. You
must hold your ground, and show your claws,--and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) know that
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) spits, you can scratch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't want to be a cat myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>)'ll find I'm of the genus, but of the tiger kind, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>)
persecutes me. Alice, there's one thing I have made up my mind about.
I will not be persecuted. If my husband tells me to do anything, as
long as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is my husband I'll do it; but I won't be persecuted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should remember that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was a very old friend of Mr. Palliser's
mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do remember; and that may be a very good reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should
come here occasionally, or go to Matching, or to any place in which
we may be living. It's a bore, of course; but it's a natural bore,
and one that ought to be borne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that will be the beginning and the end of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid not, my dear. It may perhaps be the end of it, but I fear
it won't be the beginning. I won't be persecuted. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) gives me
advice, I shall tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face that it's not wanted; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
insults any friend of mine, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did you, I shall tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had better stay away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'ll go and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), of course; but I can't
help that. I've made up my mind that I won't be persecuted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/>After that, Lady Glencora felt no further inclination to show Burgo's
letter to Alice on that occasion. They sat over the drawing-room
fire, talking chiefly of Alice's affairs, till it was time for them
to dress. But Alice, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) spoke much of Mr. Grey, said no word
as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) engagement with George Vavasor. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) speak of it,
inasmuch as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had already resolved,--already almost resolved,--that
that engagement also should be broken?

<p/>Alice, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) came down to the drawing-room, before dinner, found
Mr. Bott there alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had dressed more quickly than her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) friend,
and Mr. Palliser had not yet made his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) appearance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not expect the pleasure of meeting Miss Vavasor to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) came up, offering his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand, and
then sat down, merely muttering some word of reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We spent a very pleasant month down at Matching together;--didn't
you think so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I spent a pleasant month there certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You left, if I remember, the morning after that late walk out among
the ruins? That was unfortunate, was it not? Poor Lady Glencora! it
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) very ill; so much so, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could not go to Monkshade,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) particularly wished. It was very sad. Lady Glencora is very
delicate,--very delicate, indeed. We, who have the privilege of being
near her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), ought always to remember that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) is at all delicate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! don't you? I'm afraid that's your mistake, Miss Vavasor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) has very good health, which is the greatest blessing
in the world. By delicate I suppose you mean weak and infirm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, no,--not in the least,--not infirm certainly! I should be
very sorry to be supposed to have said that Lady Glencora is infirm.
What I mean is, not robust, Miss Vavasor. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) general organization,
if you understand me, is exquisitely delicate. One can see that, I
think, in every glance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) eye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice was going to protest that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had never seen it at all, when Mr.
Palliser entered the room along with Mrs. Marsham.

<p/>The two gentlemen shook hands, and then Mr. Palliser turned to Alice.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) perceived at once by his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) face that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was unwelcome, and wished
herself away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) house. It might be all very well for Lady
Glencora to fight with Mrs. Marsham,--and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) husband, too, in
regard to the Marsham persecution,--but there could be no reason why
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) should do so. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) just touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) hand, barely closing his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thumb
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) fingers, and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) was. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) turned away from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) side of the fire, and began talking to Mrs. Marsham on the other.
There was that in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face and in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) manner which was positively
offensive to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) made no allusion to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) former acquaintance with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>),--spoke no word about Matching, no word about his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife, as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
would naturally have done to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife's friend. Alice felt the blood
mount into her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face, and regretted greatly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had ever come
among these people. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) not long since made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
would avoid her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) great relations, and did not all this prove that it
would have been well for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to have clung to that resolution? What
was Lady Glencora to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) should submit herself to be treated
as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) were a poor companion,--a dependent, who received a
salary for her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) attendance,--an indigent cousin, hanging on to the
bounty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) rich connection? Alice was proud to a fault. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
nursed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) pride till it was very faulty. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) troubles and
sorrows in life had come from an overfed craving for independence.
Why, then, should she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) submit to be treated with open want of courtesy
by any man; but, of all men, why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) submit to it from such a
one as Mr. Palliser,--the heir of a ducal house, rolling in wealth,
and magnificent with all the magnificence of British pomp and pride?
No; she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would make Lady Glencora understand that the close intimacies
of daily life were not possible to them!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I declare I'm very much ashamed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) entered
the room. <div class="bookquote">``I shan't apologize to you, Alice, for it was you who kept
me talking; but I do beg Mrs. Marsham's pardon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marsham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Marsham was all smiles and forgiveness, and hoped that Lady
Glencora would not make a stranger of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>). Then dinner was announced,
and Alice had to walk down stairs by herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not care a
doit for that, but there had been a disagreeable little contest when
the moment came. Lady Glencora had wished to give up Mr. Bott to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
cousin, but Mr. Bott had stuck manfully to Lady Glencora's side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>)
hoped to take Lady Glencora down to dinner very often, and was not at
all disposed to abate his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) privilege.

<p/>During dinner-time Alice said very little, nor was there given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
opportunity of saying much. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not but think of the day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
first arrival at Matching Priory, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had sat between the Duke
of St. Bungay and Jeffrey Palliser, and when everybody had been so
civil to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) now occupied one side of the table by herself,
away from the fire, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt cold and desolate in the gloom of
the large half-lighted room. Mr. Palliser occupied himself with Mrs.
Marsham, who talked politics to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>); and Mr. Bott never lost a moment
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) endeavours to say some civil word to Lady Glencora. Lady
Glencora gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) no encouragement; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) hardly dared to snub
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) openly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband's immediate presence. Twenty times during
dinner she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said some little word to Alice, attempting at first to
make the time pleasant, and then, when the matter was too far gone
for that, attempting to give some relief. But it was of no avail.
There are moments in which conversation seems to be impossible,--in
which the very gods interfere to put a seal upon the lips of the
unfortunate one. It was such a moment now with Alice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had never
as yet been used to snubbing. Whatever position she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had hitherto
held, in that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had always stood foremost,--much more so than had
been good for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). When she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had gone to Matching, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had trembled
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) position; but there all had gone well with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>); there
Lady Glencora's kindness had at first been able to secure for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) a reception that had been flattering, and almost better than
flattering. Jeffrey Palliser had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) friend, and would, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
so willed it, have been more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) friend. But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) felt that
the halls of the Pallisers were too cold for her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), and that the sooner
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) escaped from their gloom and hard discourtesy the better for her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>).

<p/>Mrs. Marsham, when the three ladies had returned to the drawing-room
together, was a little triumphant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) had put Alice
down; and with the energetic prudence of a good general who knows
that he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) should follow up a victory, let the cost of doing so be what
it may, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) determined to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) down. Alice had resolved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
would come as seldom as might be to Mr. Palliser's house in Park
Lane. That resolution on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) part was in close accordance with Mrs.
Marsham's own views.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Miss Vavasor going to walk home?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Walk home;--all along Oxford Street! Good gracious! no. Why should
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) walk? The carriage will take her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or a cab,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``I am quite used to go about London in a cab
by myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think they are nice for young ladies after dark,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marsham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Marsham. <div class="bookquote">``I was going to offer my servant to walk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) is an
elderly woman, and would not mind it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure Alice is very much obliged,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>said Lady. Glencora; <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
will have the carriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very good-natured,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marsham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Marsham; <div class="bookquote">``but gentlemen do so
dislike having their horses out at night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marsham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No gentleman's horses will be out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, savagely;
<div class="bookquote">``and as for mine, it's what they are there for.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>It was not often
that Lady Glencora made any allusion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) own property, or allowed
any one near her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) to suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) remembered the fact that her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
husband's great wealth was, in truth, her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) wealth. As to many matters
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) mind was wrong. In some things her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) taste was not delicate as
should be that of a woman. But, as regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) money, no woman could
have behaved with greater reticence, or a purer delicacy. But now,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was twitted by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband's special friend with ill-usage
to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband's horses, because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chose to send her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own friend
home in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own carriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did find it hard to bear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say it's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marsham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Marsham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Palliser has given me my
horses for my own use, to do as I like with them; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) thinks I
take them out when they ought to be left at home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) can tell me so.
Nobody else has a right to do it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora, by this time, was
almost in a passion, and showed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Lady Glencora, you have mistaken me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marsham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Marsham; <div class="bookquote">``I
did not mean anything of that kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marsham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``And it is such a pity, as I am quite
used to going about in cabs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't you? I'd
go home in a wheelbarrow if I couldn't walk, and had no other
conveyance. That's not the question. Mrs. Marsham understands that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, I don't understand anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said that lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora; <div class="bookquote">``that in all such matters as
that, I intend to follow my own pleasure. Come, Alice, let us have
some coffee,'' (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) rang the bell. <div class="bookquote">``What a fuss we have made about
a stupid old carriage!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The gentlemen</b></font>)</div><p/>The gentlemen did not return to the drawing-room that evening,
having, no doubt, joint work to do in arranging the great financial
calculations of the nation; and, at an early hour, Alice was taken
home in Lady Glencora's brougham, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) cousin still in the
hands of Mrs. Marsham.




<p/>CHAPTER XLIV.

<p/>The Election for the Chelsea Districts.


<p/>March came, and still the Chancellor of the Exchequer held his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>)
position. In the early days of March there was given in the House a
certain parliamentary explanation on the subject, which, however, did
not explain very much to any person. A statement was made which was
declared by the persons making it to be altogether satisfactory, but
nobody else seemed to find any satisfaction in it. The big wigs of
the Cabinet had made an arrangement which, from the language used
by them on this occasion, they must be supposed to have regarded as
hardly less permanent than the stars; but everybody else protested
that the Government was going to pieces; and Mr. Bott was heard
to declare in clubs and lobbies, and wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) could get a
semi-public, political hearing, that this kind of thing wouldn't do.
Lord Brock must either blow hot or cold. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) chose to lean upon Mr.
Palliser, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) might lean upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), and Mr. Palliser would not be found
wanting. In such case no opposition could touch Lord Brock or the
Government. That was Mr. Bott's opinion. But if Lord Brock did not so
choose, why, in that case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) must expect that Mr. Palliser, and Mr.
Palliser's friends, would--. Mr. Bott did not say what they would do;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) was supposed by those who understood the matter to hint at an
Opposition lobby, and adverse divisions, and to threaten Lord Brock
with the open enmity of Mr. Palliser,--and of Mr. Palliser's great
follower.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This kind of thing won't do long, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Bott for
the second or third time, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) stood upon the rug before the fire at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) club, with one or two of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) young friends around him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Calder Jones/Jones</b></font>)</div>said Calder Jones, the hunting Member of Parliament
whom we once met at Roebury. <div class="bookquote">``Planty Pall won't stand it, I should
say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What can he (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) do?''  (<font color='red'><b>an Member</b></font>)</div>asked another, an unfledged Member who was not as
yet quite settled as to the leadership under which he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) intended to
work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What can he (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bott, who on such an occasion as this could
be very great,--who, for a moment, could almost feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) might
become a leader of a party for himself, and some day institute a Bott
Ministry. <div class="bookquote">``What can he (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) do? You will very shortly see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) can do.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) can make himself the master of the occasion. If Lord Brock doesn't
look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>)'ll find that Mr. Palliser will be in the Cabinet
without his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) help.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean to say that the Queen will send for Planty Pall!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Member</b></font>)</div>said the young Member.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean to say that the Queen will send for any one that the House
of Commons may direct her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) to call upon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bott, who conceived
himself to have gauged the very depths of our glorious Constitution.
<div class="bookquote">``How hard it is to make any one understand that the Queen has really
nothing to do with it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Bott, draw it mild,''  (<font color='red'><b>Calder Jones/Jones</b></font>)</div>said Calder Jones, whose loyalty was
shocked by the utter Manchesterialism of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) political friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if I know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bott, with something of grandeur in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>)
tone and countenance. <div class="bookquote">``I never drew it mild yet, and I shan't begin
now. All our political offences against civilization have come from
men drawing it mild, as you call it. Why is it that Englishmen can't
read and write as Americans do? Why can't they vote as they do even
in Imperial France? Why are they serfs, less free than those whose
chains were broken the other day in Russia? Why is the Spaniard more
happy, and the Italian more contented? Because men in power have been
drawing it mild!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>And Mr. Bott made an action with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) hand as though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) were drawing up beer from a patent tap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you can't set aside Her (<font color='blue'><b>serfs</b></font>) Majesty like that, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Member notions</b></font>)</div>said the
young Member, who had been presented, and whose mother's old-world
notions about the throne still clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be very sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bott; <div class="bookquote">``I'm no republican.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>With
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) constitutional love, Mr. Bott did not know what the word
republican meant. <div class="bookquote">``I mean no disrespect to the throne. The throne in
its place is very well. But the power of governing this great nation
does not rest with the throne. It is contained within the four walls
of the House of Commons. That is the great truth which all young
Members should learn, and take to their hearts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you think Planty Pall will become Prime Minister?''  (<font color='red'><b>Calder Jones/Jones</b></font>)</div>said Calder
Jones.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't said that; but there are more unlikely things. Among young
men I know no man more likely. But I certainly think this,--that if
Lord Brock doesn't take him (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) into the Cabinet, Lord Brock won't long
remain there himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>posters</b></font>)</div><p/>In the meantime the election came on in the Chelsea districts, and
the whole of the south-western part of the metropolis was covered
with posters bearing George Vavasor's name. <div class="bookquote">``Vote for Vavasor and the
River Bank.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That was the cry with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) went to the electors; and
though it must be presumed that it was understood by some portion of
the Chelsea electors, it was perfectly unintelligible to the majority
of those who read it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) special acquaintances and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) general
enemies called him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) Viscount Riverbank, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was pestered on all
sides by questions as to Father Thames. It was Mr. Scruby who invented
the legend, and who gave George Vavasor an infinity of trouble by the
invention. There was a question in those days as to embanking the
river from the Houses of Parliament up to the remote desolations
of further Pimlico, and Mr. Scruby recommended the coming Member
to pledge himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) would have the work carried on even to
Battersea Bridge. <div class="bookquote">``You must have a subject,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>pleaded Mr. Scruby. <div class="bookquote">``No
young Member can do anything without a subject. And it should be
local;--that is to say, if you have anything of a constituency. Such
a subject as that, if it's well worked, may save you thousands of
pounds--thousands of pounds at future elections.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It won't save me anything at this one, I take it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it may secure the seat, Mr. Vavasor, and afterwards make you the
most popular metropolitan Member in the House; that is, with your
own constituency. Only look at the money that would be spent in the
districts if that were done! It would come to millions, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it never will be done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What matters that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>and Mr. Scruby almost became eloquent as he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>)
explained the nature of a good parliamentary subject. <div class="bookquote">``You should
work it up, so as to be able to discuss it at all points. Get the
figures by heart, and then, as nobody else will do so, nobody can put
you down. Of course it won't be done. If it were done, that would be
an end of it, and your bread would be taken out of your mouth. But
you can always promise it at the hustings, and can always demand
it in the House. I've known men who've walked into as much as two
thousand a year, permanent place, on the strength of a worse subject
than that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div><p/>Vavasor allowed Mr. Scruby to manage the matter for him (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>), and took
up the subject of the River Bank. <div class="bookquote">``Vavasor and the River Bank''
 (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>was carried about by an army of men with iron shoulder-straps,
and huge pasteboard placards six feet high on the top of them.
You would think, as you saw the long rows, that the men were
being marshalled to their several routes; but they always kept
together--four-and-twenty at the heels of each other. <div class="bookquote">``One placard
at a time would strike the eye,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vavasor, counting the
expense up to himself. <div class="bookquote">``There's no doubt of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Scruby in
reply. <div class="bookquote">``One placard will do that, if it's big enough; but it takes
four-and-twenty to touch the imagination.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And then sides of houses
were covered with that shibboleth--<div class="bookquote">``Vavasor and the River Bank'' (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>--the
same words repeated in columns down the whole sides of houses.
Vavasor himself declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) was ashamed to walk among his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) future
constituents, so conspicuous had his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) name become. Grimes saw it,
and was dismayed. At first, Grimes ridiculed the cry with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>)
publican's wit. <div class="bookquote">``Unless he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mean to drown hisself in the Reach, it's
hard to say what he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) do mean by all that gammon about the River Bank,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimes/Grimes</b></font>)</div>said Grimes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) canvassed for the other Liberal candidate. But,
after a while, Grimes was driven to confess that Mr. Scruby knew what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) was about. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is a sharp `un, that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimes/Grimes</b></font>)</div>said Grimes in the
inside bar of the <div class="bookquote">``Handsome Man;''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimes/Grimes</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) almost regretted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>)
had left the leadership of Mr. Scruby, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) knew that on this
occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) would not have gotten his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) odd money.

<p/>George Vavasor, with much labour, actually did get up the subject of
the River Bank. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) got himself introduced to men belonging to the
Metropolitan Board, and went manfully into the matter of pounds,
shillings, and pence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was able even to work himself into an
apparent heat when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was told that the thing was out of the
question; and soon found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had disciples who really believed in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) could have brought himself to believe in the thing,--if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) could have been induced himself to care whether Chelsea was to
be embanked or no, the work would not have been so difficult to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>).
In that case it would have done good to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>), if to no one else. But
such belief was beyond him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had gone too far in life to be capable
of believing in, or of caring for, such things. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was ambitious
of having a hand in the government of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) country, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was not
capable of caring even for that.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) worked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) worked hard, and spoke vehemently, and promised
the men of Chelsea, Pimlico, and Brompton that the path of London
westwards had hardly commenced as yet. Sloane Street should be the
new Cheapside. Squares should arise around the Chelsea barracks, with
sides open to the water, for which Belgravia would be deserted. There
should be palaces there for the rich, because the rich spend their
riches; but no rich man's palace should interfere with the poor man's
right to the River Bank. Three millions and a half should be spent
on the noble street to be constructed, the grandest pathway that the
world should ever yet have seen; three millions and a half to be
drawn from,--to be drawn from anywhere except from Chelsea;--from the
bloated money-bags of the City Corporation, Vavasor once ventured
to declare, amidst the encouraging shouts of the men of Chelsea. Mr.
Scruby was forced to own that his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) pupil worked the subject well.
<div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, that was uncommon good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) said, almost patting
Vavasor on the back, after a speech in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) had vehemently
asserted that his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) ambition to represent the Chelsea districts had all
come of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) long-fixed idea that the glory of future London would be
brought about by the embankment of the river at Chelsea.

<p/>But armies of men carrying big boards, and public-houses open at
every corner, and placards in which the letters are three feet long,
cost money. Those few modest hundreds which Mr. Scruby had already
received before the work began, had been paid on the supposition that
the election would not take place till September. Mr. Scruby made an
early request, a very early request, that a further sum of fifteen
hundred pounds should be placed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) hands; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) did this in
a tone which clearly signified that not a man would be sent about
through the streets, or a poster put upon a wall, till this request
had been conceded. Mr. Scruby was in possession of two very distinct
manners of address. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) jovial moods, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) was instigating his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>)
clients to fight their battles well, it might almost be thought that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) was doing it really for the love of the thing; and some clients,
so thinking, had believed for a few hours that Scruby, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>)
jolly, passionate eagerness, would pour out his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) own money like dust,
trusting implicitly to future days for its return. But such clients
had soon encountered Mr. Scruby's other manner, and had perceived that
they were mistaken.

<p/>The thing had come so suddenly upon George Vavasor that there was not
time for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) to carry on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) further operations through his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) sister.
Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) written to Kate,--let him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) have written in what language he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
would,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would have first rejoined by a negative, and there would
have been a correspondence before he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had induced her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) to comply.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) thought of sending for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) by telegram, but even in that there
would have been too much delay. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) resolved, therefore, to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
application to Alice himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), explaining his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
condition. The election had come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) quite suddenly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
knew, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) wanted two thousand pounds instantly, and felt
little scruple in asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) for it, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was aware that the old
Squire would be only too glad to saddle the property with a legacy
to Alice for the repayment of this money, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would not have
advanced a shilling himself for the purpose of the election. Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) said a word or two as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) prolonged absence from Queen Anne
Street. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had not been there because he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had felt, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) manner
when they last met, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) would for a while prefer to be left free
from the unavoidable excitement of such interviews. But should he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) be
triumphant in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) present contest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) should go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) to share his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
triumph with her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>); or, should he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) fail, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) should go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) to console
him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) failure.

<p/>Within three days he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>), saying that the money would
be at once placed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) credit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) also her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) candid good
wishes for success in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) enterprise, but beyond this her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) letter
said nothing. There was no word of love,--no word of welcome,--no
expression of a desire to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). Vavasor, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) perceived all this
in the reading of her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) note, felt a triumph in the possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)
money. She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) was ill-using him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) coldness, and there was comfort
in revenge. <div class="bookquote">``It serves her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) said to himself. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) should
have married me at once when she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would do so, and then it
would have been my own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tombe</b></font>)</div><p/>When Mr. Tombe had communicated with John Grey on the matter of this
increased demand,--this demand which Mr. Tombe began to regard as
carrying a love-affair rather too far,--Grey had telegraphed back
that Vavasor's demand for money, if made through Mr. John Vavasor, was
to be honoured to the extent of five thousand pounds. Mr. Tombe raised
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) eyebrows, and reflected that some men were very foolish. But John
Grey's money matters were of such a nature as to make Mr. Tombe know
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) must do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) was bidden; and the money was paid to George
Vavasor's account.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) told Kate nothing of this. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) trouble himself to do so?
Indeed, at this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) wrote no letters to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) sister, though she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
twice sent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>), knowing what his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) exigencies would be, and made
further tenders of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) could not reply to these offers
without telling her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) that money had been forthcoming from that other
quarter, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) left them unanswered.

<p/>In the meantime the battle went on gloriously. Mr. Travers, the other
Liberal candidate, spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Travers</b></font>) money freely,--or else some other person
did so on his (<font color='blue'><b>Travers</b></font>) behalf. When Mr. Scruby mentioned this last alternative
to George Vavasor, George cursed his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own luck in that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had never
found such backers. <div class="bookquote">``I don't call a man half a Member when he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>)'s
brought in like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Scruby, comforting him (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) can't do
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) likes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) vote. He (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) ain't independent. You never hear of
those fellows getting anything good. Pay for the article yourself, Mr.
Vavasor, and then it's your own. That's what I always say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimes/Grimes</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Grimes went to work strenuously, almost fiercely, in the opposite
interest, telling all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) knew, and perhaps more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) knew, of
Vavasor's circumstances. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) was at work morning, noon, and night, not
only in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) own neighbourhood, but among those men on the river bank
of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) had spoken so much in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) interview with Vavasor in Cecil
Street. The entire Vavasorian army with its placards was entirely
upset on more than one occasion, and was once absolutely driven
ignominiously into the river mud. And all this was done under the
direction of Mr. Grimes. Vavasor himself was pelted with offal from
the sinking tide, so that the very name of the River Bank became
odious to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) was a man who did not like to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) person
touched, and when they hustled him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) became angry. <div class="bookquote">``Lord love you,
Mr. Vavasor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Scruby, <div class="bookquote">``that's nothing! I've had a candidate so
mauled,--it was in the Hamlets, I think,--that there wasn't a spot
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) that wasn't painted with rotten eggs. The smell was something
quite awful. But I brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) in, through it all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div><p/>And Mr. Scruby at last did as much for George Vavasor as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had done
for the hero of the Hamlets. At the close of the poll Vavasor's name
stood at the head by a considerable majority, and Scruby comforted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) by saying that Travers certainly wouldn't stand the expense of a
petition, as the seat was to be held only for a few months.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you've done it very cheap, Mr. Vavasor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Scruby,
<div class="bookquote">``considering that the seat is metropolitan. I do say that you have
done it cheap. Another thousand, or twelve hundred, will cover
everything--say thirteen, perhaps, at the outside. And when you shall
have fought the battle once again, you'll have paid your footing, and
the fellows will let you in almost for nothing after that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div><p/>A further sum of thirteen hundred pounds was wanted at once, and then
the whole thing was to be repeated over again in six months' time!
This was not consolatory. But, nevertheless, there was a triumph in
the thing itself which George Vavasor was man enough to enjoy. It
would be something to have sat in the House of Commons, though it
should only have been for half a session.




<p/>CHAPTER XLV.

<p/>George Vavasor Takes His (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) Seat.


<p/>George Vavasor's feeling of triumph was not unjustifiable. It is
something to have sat in the House of Commons, though it has been but
for one session! There is on the left-hand side of our great national
hall,--on the left-hand side as one enters it, and opposite to the
doors leading to the Law Courts,--a pair of gilded lamps, with a door
between them, near to which a privileged old dame sells her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) apples
and her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) oranges solely, as I presume, for the accommodation of the
Members of the House and of the great policeman who guards the pass.
Between those lamps is the entrance to the House of Commons, and none
but Members may go that way! It is the only gate before which I have
ever stood filled with envy,--sorrowing to think that my steps might
never pass under it. There are many portals forbidden to me, as there
are many forbidden to all men; and forbidden fruit, they say, is
sweet; but my lips have watered after no other fruit but that which
grows so high, within the sweep of that great policeman's truncheon.

<p/>Ah, my male friend and reader, who earnest thy bread, perhaps, as a
country vicar; or sittest, may-be, at some weary desk in Somerset
House; or who, perhaps, rulest the yard behind the Cheapside counter,
hast thou never stood there and longed,--hast thou never confessed,
when standing there, that Fate has been unkind to thee in denying
thee the one thing that thou hast wanted? I have done so; and as my
slow steps have led me up that more than royal staircase, to those
passages and halls which require the hallowing breath of centuries to
give them the glory in British eyes which they shall one day possess,
I have told myself, in anger and in grief, that to die and not to
have won that right of way, though but for a session,--not to have
passed by the narrow entrance through those lamps,--is to die and
not to have done that which it most becomes an Englishman to have
achieved.

<p/>There are, doubtless, some who come out by that road, the loss of
whose society is not to be regretted. England does not choose her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) six
hundred and fifty-four best men. One comforts one's self, sometimes,
with remembering that. The George Vavasors, the Calder Joneses, and
the Botts are admitted. Dishonesty, ignorance, and vulgarity do
not close the gate of that heaven against aspirants; and it is a
consolation to the ambition of the poor to know that the ambition of
the rich can attain that glory by the strength of its riches alone.
But though England does not send thither none but her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) best men, the
best of her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) Commoners do find their way there. It is the highest
and most legitimate pride of an Englishman to have the letters
M.P. written after his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) name. No selection from the alphabet, no
doctorship, no fellowship, be it of ever so learned or royal a
society, no knightship,--not though it be of the Garter,--confers so
fair an honour. Mr. Bott was right when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) declared that this country
is governed from between the walls of that House, though the truth
was almost defiled by the lips which uttered it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) might have added
that from thence flow the waters of the world's progress,--the
fullest fountain of advancing civilization.

<p/>George Vavasor, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) went in by the lamps and the apple-stall, under
the guardianship of Mr. Bott, felt all the pride of which I have been
speaking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) was a man quite capable of feeling such pride as it
should be felt,--capable, in certain dreamy moments, of looking at
the thing with pure and almost noble eyes; of understanding the
ambition of serving with truth so great a nation as that which fate
had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) own. Nature, I think, had so fashioned George Vavasor,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) might have been a good, and perhaps a great man; whereas Mr.
Bott had been born small. Vavasor had educated himself to badness
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) eyes open. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) had known what was wrong, and had done it,
having taught himself to think that bad things were best. But poor
Mr. Bott had meant to do well, and thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) had done very well
indeed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) was a tuft-hunter and a toady, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) did not know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>)
was doing amiss in seeking to rise by tuft-hunting and toadying. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>)
was both mean and vain, both a bully and a coward, and in politics,
I fear, quite unscrupulous in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) grand dogmas; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>)
believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) was progressing in public life by the proper and
usual means, and was troubled by no idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) did wrong.

<p/>Vavasor, in those dreamy moments of which I have spoken, would
sometimes feel tempted to cut his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) throat and put an end to himself,
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) had taught himself amiss. Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) would
sadly ask himself whether it was yet too late; always, however,
answering himself that it was too late. Even now, at this moment,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) went in between the lamps, and felt much of the honest pride
of which I have spoken, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) told himself that it was too late. What
could he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) do now, hampered by such a debt as that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) owed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>)
cousin, and with the knowledge that it must be almost indefinitely
increased, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) meant to give up this seat in Parliament, which
had cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) so dearly, almost before he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) had begun to enjoy it? But
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) courage was good, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) was able to resolve that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) would go on
with the business that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) had in hand, and play out his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) game to the
end. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) had achieved his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) seat in the House of Commons, and was so
far successful. Men who had ever been gracious to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) were now more
gracious than ever, and they who had not hitherto treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) with
courtesy, now began to smile and to be very civil. It was, no doubt,
a great thing to have the privilege of that entrance between the
lamps.

<p/>Mr. Bott had the new Member now in hand, not because there had been
any old friendship between them, but Mr. Bott was on the look-out for
followers, and Vavasor was on the look-out for a party. A man gets
no great thanks for attaching himself to existing power. Our friend
might have enrolled himself among the general supporters of the
Government without attracting much attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would in such case
have been at the bottom of a long list. But Mr. Palliser was a rising
man, round whom, almost without wish of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) own, a party was forming
itself. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) came into power,--as come he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) must, according to Mr. Bott
and many others,--then they who had acknowledged the new light before
its brightness had been declared, might expect their reward.

<p/>Vavasor, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) passed through the lobby to the door of the House,
leaning on Mr. Bott's arm, was very silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) had spoken but little
since they had left their cab in Palace Yard, and was not very well
pleased by the garrulity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) companion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) was going to sit among
the first men of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) nation, and to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) chance of making himself
one of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) believed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) own ability; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) believed thoroughly
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) own courage; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) did not believe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) own conduct. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>)
feared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) had done,--feared still more strongly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) would
be driven to do,--that which would shut men's ears against his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) words,
and would banish him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) from high places. No man believes in himself who
knows himself to be a rascal, however great may be his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) talent, or
however high his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) pluck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you have heard a debate?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bott.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>answered Vavasor, who wished to remain silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Many, probably?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have heard debates from the gallery. Now you'll hear them
from the body of the House, and you'll find how very different it is.
There's no man can know what Parliament is who has never had a seat.
Indeed no one can thoroughly understand the British Constitution
without it. I felt, very early in life, that that should be my line;
and though it's hard work and no pay, I mean to stick to it. How
do, Thompson? You know Vavasor? He (<font color='blue'><b>Thompson</b></font>)'s just returned for the Chelsea
Districts, and I'm taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Thompson</b></font>) up. We shan't divide to-night; shall
we? Look! there's Farringcourt just coming out; he (<font color='blue'><b>Thompson</b></font>)'s listened to
better than any man in the House now, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Thompson</b></font>)'ll borrow half-a-crown
from you if you'll lend him (<font color='blue'><b>Thompson</b></font>) one. How d'ye do, my lord? I hope I have
the pleasure of seeing you well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>and Bott bowed low to a lord who
was hurrying through the lobby as fast as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) shuffling feet would
carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Of course you know him (<font color='blue'><b>Thompson</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lord</b></font>)</div><p/>Vavasor, however, did not know the lord in question, and was obliged
to say so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you were up to all these things?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>said Bott.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Taking the peerage generally, I am not up to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor, with
a curl on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) lip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you ought to have known him (<font color='blue'><b>Thompson</b></font>). That was Viscount Middlesex; he (<font color='blue'><b>Thompson</b></font>) has
got something on to-night about the Irish Church. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thompson</b></font>) father is past
ninety, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thompson</b></font>)'s over sixty. We'll go in now; but let me give you one
bit of advice, my dear fellow--don't think of speaking this session.
A Member can do no good at that work till he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) has learned something of
the forms of the House. The forms of the House are everything; upon
my word they are. This is Mr. Vavasor, the new Member for the Chelsea
Districts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Our friend was thus introduced to the doorkeeper, who smiled
familiarly, and seemed to wink his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) eye. Then George Vavasor passed
through into the House itself, under the wing of Mr. Bott.

<p/>Vavasor, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) walked up the House to the Clerk's table and took the
oath and then walked down again, felt himself to be almost taken
aback by the little notice which was accorded to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>). It was not that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) had expected to create a sensation, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) had for a moment
thought on the subject, but the thing which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) was doing was so
great to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>), that the total indifference of those around him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) was
a surprise to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>). After he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) seat, a few men came up
by degrees and shook hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>); but it seemed, as they did so,
merely because they were passing that way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) was anxious not to
sit next to Mr. Bott, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) found himself unable to avoid this
contiguity. That gentleman stuck to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pertinaciously, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
directions which, at the spur of the moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hardly knew how not
to obey. So he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) found himself sitting behind Mr. Palliser, a little to
the right, while Mr. Bott occupied the ear of the rising man.

<p/>There was a debate in progress, but it seemed to Vavasor, as soon
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) was able to become critical, to be but a dull affair, and yet
the Chancellor of the Exchequer was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) legs, and Mr. Palliser
was watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) as a cat watches a mouse. The speaker was full of
figures, as becomes a Chancellor of the Exchequer; and as every new
budget of them fell from him (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>), Mr. Bott, with audible whispers, poured
into the ear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) chief certain calculations of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) own, most of
which went to prove that the financier in office was altogether
wrong. Vavasor thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) could see that Mr. Palliser was
receiving more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) assistance than was palatable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would
listen, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) did listen, without making any sign that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) heard, and
would occasionally shake his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) head with symptoms of impatience. But
Mr. Bott was a man not to be repressed by a trifle. When Mr. Palliser
shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) head he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) became more assiduous than ever, and when Mr.
Palliser slightly moved himself to the left, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) boldly followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>).

<p/>No general debate arose on the subject which the Minister had in
hand, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) sat down, Mr. Palliser would not get up, though
Mr. Bott counselled him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) to do so. The matter was over for the night,
and the time had arrived for Lord Middlesex. That nobleman got upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) feet, with a roll of papers in his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) hand, and was proceeding to
address the House on certain matters of church reform, with great
energy; but, alas, for him (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) and for his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) feelings! before his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) energy
had got itself into full swing, the Members were swarming away
through the doors like a flock of sheep. Mr. Palliser got up and went,
and was followed at once by Mr. Bott, who succeeded in getting hold
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) arm in the lobby. Had not Mr. Palliser been an even-tempered,
calculating man, with a mind and spirit well under his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) command, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
must have learned to hate Mr. Bott before this time. Away streamed the
Members, but still the noble lord went on speaking, struggling hard
to keep up his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) fire as though no such exodus were in process. There
was but little to console him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) knew that the papers would not
report one sentence in twenty of those he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) uttered. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) knew that no
one would listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) willingly. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had worked for
weeks and months to get up his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) facts, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was beginning to know
that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had worked in vain. As he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) summoned courage to look round, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
began to fear that some enemy would count the House, and that all
would be over. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had given heart and soul to this affair. His (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) cry
was not as Vavasor's cry about the River Bank. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) believed in his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) own
subject with a great faith, thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) could make men happier
and better, and bring them nearer to their God. I said that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had
worked for weeks and months. I might have said that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had been all
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) life at this work. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shuffled with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) feet when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
walked, and knocked his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) words together when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) talked, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was an
earnest man, meaning to do well, seeking no other reward for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
work than the appreciation of those whom he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) desired to serve. But
this was never to be his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). For him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) there was in store nothing but
disappointment. And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will work on to the end, either in this
House or in the other, labouring wearily, without visible wages of
any kind, and, one may say, very sadly. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has been taken to
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) long rest, men will acknowledge that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has done something, and
there will be left on the minds of those who shall remember him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) a
conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) served a good cause diligently, and not altogether
inefficiently. Invisible are his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wages, yet in some coin are they
paid. Invisible is the thing he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) does, and yet it is done. Let us hope
that some sense of this tardy appreciation may soothe his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) spirit
beyond the grave. On the present occasion there was nothing to soothe
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) spirit. The Speaker sat, urbane and courteous, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) eyes
turned towards the unfortunate orator; but no other ears in the House
seemed to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>). The corps of reporters had dwindled down to
two, and they used their pens very listlessly, taking down here a
sentence and there a sentence, knowing that their work was naught.
Vavasor sat it out to the last, as it taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) a lesson in those
forms of the House which Mr. Bott had truly told him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) it would be
well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) should learn. And at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) did learn the form of a
<div class="bookquote">``count-out.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Some one from a back seat muttered something, which the
Speaker understood; and that high officer, having had his (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) attention
called to a fact of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) would never have taken cognizance
without such calling, did count the House, and finding that it
contained but twenty-three Members, he (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) put an end to his (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) own labours
and to those of poor Lord Middlesex. With what feelings that noble
lord must have taken himself home, and sat himself down in his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) study,
vainly opening a book before his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) eyes, can we not all imagine? A man
he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was with ample means, with children who would do honour to his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
name; one whose wife believed in him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), if no one else would do so; a
man, let us say, with a clear conscience, to whom all good things had
been given. But of whom now was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thinking with envy? Early on that
same day Farringcourt had spoken in the House,--a man to whom no one
would lend a shilling, whom the privilege of that House kept out of
gaol, whose word no man believed; who was wifeless, childless, and
unloved. But three hundred men had hung listening upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) words.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laughed in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speech, they laughed; when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was indignant
against the Minister, they sat breathless, as the Spaniard sits in
the critical moment of the bull-killing. Whichever way he (<font color='blue'><b>Spaniard</b></font>) turned
himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Spaniard</b></font>) carried them with him (<font color='blue'><b>Spaniard</b></font>). Crowds of Members flocked into the
House from libraries and smoking-rooms when it was known that this
ne'er-do-well was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Spaniard</b></font>) legs. The Strangers' Gallery was filled to
overflowing. The reporters turned their rapid pages, working their
fingers wearily till the sweat drops stood upon their brows. And
as the Premier was attacked with some special impetus of redoubled
irony, men declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Premier</b></font>) would be driven to enrol the speaker
among his (<font color='blue'><b>Premier</b></font>) colleagues, in spite of dishonoured bills and evil reports.
A man who could shake the thunderbolts like that must be paid to
shake them on the right side. It was of this man, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) success,
that Lord Middlesex was envious, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Middlesex</b></font>) sat, wretched and respectable,
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Middlesex</b></font>) solitary study!

<p/>Mr. Bott had left the House with Mr. Palliser; and Vavasor, after
the count-out, was able to walk home by himself, and think of the
position which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) had achieved. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) told himself over and over again
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) had done a great thing in obtaining that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) now
possessed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) endeavoured to teach himself that the price he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>)
was paying for it was not too dear. But already there had come upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) something of that feeling,--that terribly human feeling,--which
deprives every prize that is gained of half its value. The mere
having it robs the diamond of its purity, and mixes vile alloy with
the gold. Lord Middlesex, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Middlesex</b></font>) had floundered on into terrible
disaster, had not been a subject to envy. There had been nothing of
brilliance in the debate, and the Members had loomed no larger than
ordinary men at ordinary clubs. The very doorkeepers had hardly
treated them with respect. The great men with whose names the papers
are filled had sat silent, gloomy, and apparently idle. As soon as
a fair opportunity was given them they escaped out of the House, as
boys might escape from school. Everybody had rejoiced in the break-up
of the evening, except that one poor old lord who had worked so hard.
Vavasor had spent everything that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had to become a Member of that
House, and now, as he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) went alone to his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lodgings, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) could not but
ask himself whether the thing purchased was worth the purchase-money.

<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) courage was still high. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was gloomy, and almost sad,
he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) could trust himself to fight out the battle to the
last. On the morrow he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) would go to Queen Anne Street, and would
demand sympathy there from her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) who had professed to sympathize with
him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) so strongly in his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) political desires. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>), at any rate, the
glory of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) Membership would not be dimmed by any untoward knowledge
of the realities. She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) had only seen the play acted from the boxes;
and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) eyes the dresses would still be of silk velvet, and the
swords of bright steel.




<p/>CHAPTER XLVI.

<p/>A Love Gift.


<p/>When Alice heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin's success, and understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was
actually Member of Parliament for the Chelsea Districts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) resolved
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) would be triumphant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) had sacrificed nearly everything
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) desire for his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) success in public life, and now that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had
achieved the first great step towards that success, it would have
been madness on her (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) part to decline her (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) share in the ovation. If
she (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) could not rejoice in that, what source of joy would then be left
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) had promised to be his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) wife, and at present she (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) was
under the bonds of that promise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) had so promised because she (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>)
had desired to identify her (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) interests with his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>),--because she (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) wished
to share his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) risks, to assist his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) struggles, and to aid him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
public career. She (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) had done all this, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had been successful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>)
strove, therefore, to be triumphant on his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) behalf, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) knew that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) was striving ineffectually. She (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) had made a mistake, and the days
were coming in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) would have to own to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) had
done so in sackcloth, and to repent with ashes.

<p/>But yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) struggled to be triumphant. The tidings were first
brought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) servant, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) at once sat down to
write him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) a word or two of congratulation. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) found the task
more difficult than she (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) had expected, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) gave it up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) had
written no word to him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) since the day on which he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) almost
in anger, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) did not know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) was to address him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I
will wait till he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) comes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) said, putting away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) the paper
and pens. <div class="bookquote">``It will be easier to speak than to write.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) wrote
to Kate, and contrived to put some note of triumph into her (<font color='blue'><b>Districts</b></font>) letter.
Kate had written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) at length, filling her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) sheet with a loud pæan
of sincere rejoicing. To Kate, down in Westmoreland, it had seemed
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother had already done everything. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had already tied
Fortune to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) chariot wheels. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had made the great leap, and had
overcome the only obstacle that Fate had placed in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) way. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
great joy she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) almost forgot whence had come the money with which the
contest had been won. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was not enthusiastic in many things;--about
herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was never so; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was elated with an enthusiasm
which seemed to know no bounds. <div class="bookquote">``I am proud,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) letter
to Alice. <div class="bookquote">``No other thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) could have done would have made me
so proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>). Had the Queen sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) an earl, it
would have been as nothing to this. When I think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) has forced
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) way into Parliament without any great friend, with nothing to
back him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) but his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) own wit'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had, in truth, forgotten Alice's money
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wrote;--<div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) has achieved his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) triumph in the metropolis,
among the most wealthy and most fastidious of the richest city in the
world, I do feel proud of my brother. And, Alice, I hope that you are
proud of your lover.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Poor girl! One cannot but like her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) pride, nay,
almost love her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) for it, though it was so sorely misplaced. It must be
remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had known nothing of Messrs. Grimes and Scruby,
and the River Bank, and that the means had been wanting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) of
learning the principles upon which some metropolitan elections are
conducted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And, Alice, I hope that you are proud of your lover!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) is not
my lover,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice said to herself. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) is not. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
understands it, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) may not.''  (<font color='red'><b>lover Vavasor</b></font>)</div>And if not your lover, Alice
Vavasor, what is he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) then to you? And what are you to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), if not his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
love? She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was beginning to understand that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had put herself in
the way of utter destruction;--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had walked to the brink of
a precipice, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) must now topple over it. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) is not my
lover,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat silent and moody, and it took her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
hours to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) answer written to Kate.

<p/>On the same afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) father for a moment or two. <div class="bookquote">``So
George has got himself returned,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyebrows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has been successful. I'm sure you must be glad, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, I'm not. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) has bought a seat for three months; and
with whose money has he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) purchased it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let us always speak of money, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When you discuss the value of a thing just purchased, you must
mention the price before you know whether the purchaser has done well
or badly. They have let him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) in for his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) money because there are only a
few months left before the general election. Two thousand pounds he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
has had, I believe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if as much more is wanted for the next election he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) shall have
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, my dear;--very well, If you choose to make a beggar of
yourself, I cannot help it. Indeed, I shall not complain though he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)
should spend all your money, if you do not marry him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) at last.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>In
answer to this, Alice said nothing. On that point her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father's wishes
were fast growing to be identical with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you fairly what are my feelings and my wishes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) continued.
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing, in my opinion, would be so deplorable and ruinous as such
a marriage. You tell me that you have made up your mind to take him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>),
and I know well that nothing that I can say will turn you. But I
believe that when he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) has spent all your money he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) will not take you,
and that thus you will be saved. Thinking as I do about him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>), you can
hardly expect that I should triumph because he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) has got himself into
Parliament with your money!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and it seemed to Alice that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been very cruel.
There had been little, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought, nay, nothing of a father's loving
tenderness in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) words to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) differently,
might she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) not even now have confessed everything to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)? But herein
Alice accused him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wrongfully. Tenderness from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) on this subject
had, we may say, become impossible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had made it impossible. Nor
could he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) the extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wishes without damaging his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own
cause. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) know that all that was done was so done
with the view of driving her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) into John Grey's arms.

<p/>But what words were those for a father to speak to a daughter! Had
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) brought herself to such a state that her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own father desired to
see her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) deserted and thrown aside? And was it probable that this wish
of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should come to pass? As to that, Alice had already made up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would
never become her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin's wife. It needed not her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father's wish to
accomplish her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) salvation, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) salvation lay in being separated
from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/>On the next morning George went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). The reader will, perhaps,
remember their last interview. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) after her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) letter to
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) from Westmoreland, and had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to seal their reconciliation
with a kiss; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had refused him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had offered to embrace her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had shuddered before him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), fearing his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) touch, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) by
signs much more clear than any words, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt for him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) none of
the love of a woman. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had turned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in anger, declaring
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) honestly that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was angry. Since that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had borrowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
money,--had made two separate assaults upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) purse,--and was now
come to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) of the results. How was he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to address her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)? I beg
that it may be also remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was not a man to forget the
treatment he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had received. When he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) entered the room, Alice looked
at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), at first, almost furtively. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). It must
be confessed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) already feared him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). Had there been in the man
anything of lofty principle he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might still have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slave,
though I doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could ever again have forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to love
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) furtively, and perceived that the gash on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
face was nearly closed. The mark of existing anger was not there. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) intending to be gentle, if it might be possible. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had been careful in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dress, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wished to try once again
if the rôle of lover might be within his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reach.

<p/>Alice was the first to speak. <div class="bookquote">``George, I am so glad that you have
succeeded! I wish you joy with my whole heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks, dearest. But before I say another word, let me acknowledge
my debt. Unless you had aided me with your money, I could not have
succeeded.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, George! pray don't speak of that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me rather speak of it at once, and have done. If you will think
of it, you will know that I must speak of it sooner or later.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
smiled and looked pleasant, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used to do in those Swiss days.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, speak and have done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you have trusted me in thus giving me the command of your
fortune?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do believe that you have. I need hardly say that I could not have
stood for this last election without it; and I must try to make you
understand that if I had not come forward at this vacancy, I should
have stood no chance for the next; otherwise, I should not have been
justified in paying so dearly for a seat for one session. You can
understand that; eh, Alice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes; I think so?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anybody, even your father, would tell you that; though, probably,
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) regards my ambition to be a Member of Parliament as a sign of
downright madness. But I was obliged to stand now, if I intended to
go on with it, as that old lord died so inopportunely. Well, about
the money! It is quite upon the cards that I may be forced to ask for
another loan when the autumn comes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall have it, George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks, Alice. And now I will tell you what I propose. You know
that I have been reconciled,--with a sort of reconciliation,--to my
grandfather? Well, when the next affair is over, I propose to tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) exactly how you and I then stand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not go into that now, George. It is enough for you at present to
be assured that such assistance as I can give you is at your command.
I want you to feel the full joy of your success, and you will do so
more thoroughly if you will banish all these money troubles from your
mind for a while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They shall, at any rate, be banished while I am with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``There; let them go!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right hand, and blew at
the tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fingers. <div class="bookquote">``Let them vanish,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It is always
well to be rid of such troubles for a time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It is well to be rid of them at any time, or at all times, if only
they can be banished without danger. But when a man has overused his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
liver till it will not act for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) any longer, it is not well for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
to resolve that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will forget the weakness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) organ just as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
sits down to dinner.

<p/>It was a pretty bit of acting, that of Vavasor's, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blew away
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cares; and, upon the whole, I do not know that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could have
done better. But Alice saw through it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did so.
The whole thing was uncomfortable to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), except the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had the promise of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) further moneys. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not intend to
rest satisfied with this. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must extract from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) some meed of
approbation, some show of sympathy, some spark of affection, true or
pretended, in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might at least affect to be satisfied,
and be enabled to speak of the future without open embarrassment. How
could even he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) take her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) money from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), unless he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might presume that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) upon some ground that belonged mutually to them
both?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have already taken my seat,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I saw that in the newspapers. My acquaintance among Members of
Parliament is very small, but I see that you were introduced, as they
call it, by one of the few men that I do know. Is Mr. Bott a friend of
yours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,--certainly not a friend. I may probably have to act with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in

of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) having such a man as his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) guest. I think if I were in public
life I should try to act with people that I could like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you dislike Mr. Bott?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>), but my feelings about him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) are not violent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) is a vulgar ass,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George, <div class="bookquote">``with no more pretensions to rank

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I don't quite understand what are the requisites for
Parliamentary success, or indeed of what it consists. Is his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) ambition, I take it, does not go beyond a desire to be

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, as to mine;--there are some things, Alice, that a man does not
tell to any one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are there? They must be very terrible things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The schoolboy, when he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) sits down to make his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) rhymes, dares not say,

a hope. The preacher, when he (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) preaches his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) sermon, does not whisper,
even to his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) wife, his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) belief that thousands may perhaps be turned

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) playful manner at once deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) made this foolish
attempt to be tender? <div class="bookquote">``I do not know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, gloomily.

<p/>For a few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sat silent, fingering some article belonging to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) which was lying on the table. It was a small steel paper-knife,
of which the handle was cast and gilt; a thing of no great value, of
which the price may have been five shillings. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sat with it, passing
it through his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) fingers, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who gave you this paper-cutter?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said, suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Goodness me, why do you ask? and especially, why do you ask in that
way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I asked simply because if it is a present to you from any one, I
will take up something else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was given me by Mr. Grey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) let it drop from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) fingers on to the table with a noise, and
then pushed it from him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), so that it fell on the other side, near to
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) stooped and picked it up, <div class="bookquote">``your violence
is unreasonable; pray do not repeat it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not mean it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and I beg your pardon. I was simply
unfortunate in the article I selected. And who gave you this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>In
saying which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) took up a little ivory foot-rule that was folded up
so as to bring it within the compass of three inches.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It so happens that no one gave me that; I bought it at a stupid
bazaar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then this will do. You shall give it me as a present, on the renewal
of our love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is too poor a thing to give,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), speaking still more
gloomily than she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had done before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By no means; nothing is too poor, if given in that way. Anything
will do; a ribbon, a glove, a broken sixpence. Will you give me
something that I may take, and, taking it, may know that your heart
is given with it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take the rule, if you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And about the heart?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) asked.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) should have been more of a rascal or less. Seeing how very much of
a rascal he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) was already, I think it would have been better that he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>)
should have been more,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) should have been able to content his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>)
spirit with the simple acquisition of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) money, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) should
have been free from all those remains of a finer feeling which made
him (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) desire her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) love also. But it was not so. It was necessary for
his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) comfort that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should, at any rate, say she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Well,
Alice, and what about the heart?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) asked again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would so much rather talk about politics, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).

<p/>The cicatrice began to make itself very visible in his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) face, and the
debonair manner was fast vanishing. He (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) had fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),
and had inserted his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) thumbs in the armholes of his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) waistcoat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice, that is not quite fair,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not mean to be unfair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not so sure of that. I almost think that you do mean it. You
have told me that you intend to become my wife. If, after that, you
wilfully make me miserable, will not that be unfair?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not making you miserable,--certainly not wilfully.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did that letter which you wrote to me from Westmoreland mean
anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``George, do not strive to make me think that it meant too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it did, you had better say so at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>But Alice, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would have said so had she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) dared, made no
answer to this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat silent, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face away from his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) gaze,
longing that the meeting might be over, and feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had lost
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own self-respect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I find it very hard to understand you.
When I look back over all that has passed between us, and to that
other episode in your life, summing it all up with your conduct to me
at present, I find myself at a loss to read your character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear I cannot help you in the reading of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When you first loved me;--for you did love me. I understood that
well enough. There is no young man who in early life does not read
with sufficient clearness that sweetest morsel of poetry.--And when
you quarrelled with me, judging somewhat harshly of my offences, I
understood that also; for it is the custom of women to be hard in
their judgement on such sins. When I heard that you had accepted the
offer made to you by that gentleman in Cambridgeshire, I thought that
I understood you still,--knowing how natural it was that you should
seek some cure for your wound. I understood it, and accused myself,
not you, in that I had driven you to so fatal a remedy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Here Alice
turned round towards him (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) sharply, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) were going to
interrupt him (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said nothing, though he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) paused for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to
speak; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``And I understood it well when I heard
that this cure had been too much for you. By heavens, yes! there was
no misunderstanding that. I meant no insult to the man when I upset
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little toy just now. I have not a word to say against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). For
many women he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would make a model husband, but you are not one of
them. And when you discovered this yourself, as you did, I understood
that without difficulty. Yes, by heavens! if ever woman had been
driven to a mistake, you had been driven to one there.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) again, and met his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) with
something of his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) own fierceness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) were
preparing herself to fight with him (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said nothing at the
moment, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) again went on. <div class="bookquote">``And, Alice, I understood it
also when you again consented to be my wife. I thought that I still
understood you then. I may have been vain to think so, but surely it
was natural. I believed that the old love had come back upon you, and
again warmed your heart. I thought that it had been cold during our
separation, and I was pleased to think so. Was that unnatural? Put
yourself in my place, and say if you would not have thought so. I
told myself that I understood you then, and I told myself that in
all that you had done you had acted as a true, and good, and loving
woman. I thought of you much, and I saw that your conduct, as a
whole, was intelligible and becoming.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>The last word grated on
Alice's ears, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) anger by the motion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) foot upon
the floor. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin noted it all, but went on as though he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had
not noted it. <div class="bookquote">``But now your present behaviour makes all the rest a
riddle. You have said that you would be my wife, declaring thereby
that you had forgiven my offences, and, as I suppose, reassuring me
of your love; and yet you receive me with all imaginable coldness.
What am I to think of it, and in what way would you have me behave to
you? When last I was here I asked you for a kiss.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said this he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) with all his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) eyes, with his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) mouth just open, so as to
show the edges of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) white teeth, with the wound down his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) face all
wide and purple. The last word came with a stigmatizing hiss from
his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) lips. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not essay to speak, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) paused again, as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) were desirous that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might realize the full purport of such a
request. I think that, in the energy of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) speaking, a touch of true
passion had come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>); that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) rascaldom, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) need of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) money, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was punishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) whole
power of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) vengeance for the treatment which he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had received from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I asked you for a kiss. If you are to be my wife you can have
no shame in granting me such a request. Within the last two months
you have told me that you would marry me. What am I to think of such
a promise if you deny me all customary signs of your affection?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) paused again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found that the time had come in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
must say something to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>).


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``I asked you for a kiss.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder you cannot understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that I have suffered
much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is that to be my answer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what answer you want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Alice, do not be untrue; you do know what answer I want, and
you know also whether my wanting it is unreasonable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one ever told me that I was untrue before,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do know what it is that I desire. I desire to learn that the
woman who is to be my wife, in truth, loves me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was standing up, and so was he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) also, but still she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said nothing.
He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) hand the little rule which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
might take, but he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) held it as though in doubt what he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would do with
it. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Alice, am I to hear anything from you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not now, George; you are angry, and I will not speak to you in your
anger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have I not cause to be angry? Do you not know that you are treating
me badly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that my head aches, and that I am very wretched. I wish you
would leave me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, then, is your gift,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) threw the rule over on
to the sofa behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And there is the trumpery trinket which I
had hoped you would have worn for my sake.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Whereupon something which
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had taken from his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) waistcoat-pocket was thrown violently into the
fender, beneath the fire-grate. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) then walked with quick steps to
the door; but when his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) hand was on the handle, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) turned. <div class="bookquote">``Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``when I am gone, try to think honestly of your conduct to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) went, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) remained still, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heard the front door
close behind him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>).

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was gone, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) first movement was made in
search of the trinket. I fear that this was not dignified on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
part; but I think that it was natural. It was not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had any
desire for the jewel, or any curiosity even to see it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would very
much have preferred that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) should have brought nothing of the kind
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had a feminine reluctance that anything of value
should be destroyed without a purpose. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) took the shovel, and
poked among the ashes, and found the ring which her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin had thrown
there. It was a valuable ring, bearing a ruby on it between two small
diamonds. Such at least, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) became aware, had been its bearing; but
one of the side stones had been knocked out by the violence with
which the ring had been flung. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) searched even for this, scorching
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face and eyes, but in vain. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mind that the
diamond should be lost for ever, and that it should go out among
the cinders into the huge dust-heaps of the metropolis. Better that,
though it was distasteful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) feminine economy, than the other
alternative of setting the servants to search, and thereby telling
them something of what had been done.

<p/>When her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) search was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) placed the ring on the mantelpiece; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew that it would not do to leave it there,--so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) folded it up
carefully in a new sheet of note-paper, and put it in the drawer of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) desk. After that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat herself down at the table to think what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would do; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head was, in truth, racked with pain, and on
that occasion she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thoughts to no conclusion.




<p/>CHAPTER XLVII.

<p/>Mr. Cheesacre's Disappointment.


<p/>When Mrs. Greenow was left alone in her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) lodgings, after the little
entertainment which she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) two lovers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) sat herself
down to think seriously over her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) affairs. There were three paths open
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) might take Mr. Cheesacre, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) might take Captain
Bellfield--or she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) might decide that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) would have nothing more
to say to either of them in the way of courting. They were very
persistent, no doubt; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) would know how to make
them understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) should really make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
would have neither one nor the other. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was going to leave Norwich
after Easter, and they knew that such was her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) purpose. Something had
been said of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) returning to Yarmouth in the summer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was a just
woman at heart, and justice required that each of them should know
what was to be his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) prospect if she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) did so return.

<p/>There was a good deal to be said on Mr. Cheesacre's behalf.
Mahogany-furnitured bedrooms assist one's comfort in this life;
and heaps of manure, though they are not brilliant in romance, are
very efficacious in farming. Mrs. Greenow by no means despised these
things; and as for the owner of them, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) saw that there was
much amiss in his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) character, she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) little foibles were
of such a nature that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), as his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) wife, or any other woman of spirit,
might be able to repress them, if not to cure them. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had
already married for money once, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) told herself very plainly on
this occasion, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) might now venture on a little
love. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) marriage for money had been altogether successful. The
nursing of old Greenow had not been very disagreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), nor had
it taken longer than she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had anticipated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had now got all the
reward that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had ever promised herself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) really did feel
grateful to his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) memory. I almost think that among those plentiful
tears some few drops belonged to sincerity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was essentially a
happy-tempered woman, blessed with a good digestion, who looked back
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) past life with contentment, and forward to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) future life
with confidence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) would not be greedy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) said to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
did not want more money, and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) would have none of Mr.
Cheesacre. So far she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) resolved,--resolving also that, if possible,
the mahogany-furnitured bedrooms should be kept in the family, and
made over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) niece, Kate Vavasor.

<p/>But should she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) marry for love; and if so, should Captain Bellfield
be the man? Strange to say, his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) poverty and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) scampishness and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
lies almost recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>). At any rate, it was not of those
things that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) was afraid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) had a woman's true belief in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) own
power, and thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) could cure them,--as far as they needed
cure. As for his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) stories about Inkerman, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) little debts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>)
cared nothing about that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) also had her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) Inkermans, and was quite
aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) made as good use of them as the Captain did of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).
And as for the debts,--what was a man to do who hadn't got any money?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) also had owed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) gloves and corsets in the ante-Greenow days
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) adventures. But there was this danger,--that there might be
more behind of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) had never heard. Another Mrs. Bellfield
was not impossible; and what, if instead of being a real captain
at all, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) should be a returned ticket-of-leave man! Such things
had happened. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) chief security was in this,--that Cheesacre had
known the man for many years, and would certainly have told anything
against him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) did know. Under all these circumstances, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>)
could not quite make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) mind either for or against Captain
Bellfield.

<p/>Between nine and ten in the evening, an hour or so after Mr. Cheesacre
had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>), Jeannette brought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) some arrowroot with a little
sherry in it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) usually dined early, and it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) habit to take a
light repast before she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) retired for the night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jeannette,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) stirred the lumps of white sugar in the
bowl, <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid those two gentlemen have quarrelled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, laws, ma'am, in course they have! How was they to help it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div><p/>Jeannette, on these occasions, was in the habit of standing beside
the chair of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) mistress, and chatting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>); and then, if the
chatting was much prolonged, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) would gradually sink down upon the
corner of a chair herself,--and then the two women would be very
comfortable together over the fire, Jeannette never forgetting that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) was the servant, and Mrs. Greenow never forgetting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was
the mistress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why should they quarrel, Jeannette? It's very foolish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know about being foolish, ma'am; but it's the most natural
thing in life. If I had two beaux as was a-courting me together,
in course I should expect as they would punch each other's heads.
There's some girls do it a purpose, because they like to see it. One
at a time's what I say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a young thing, Jeannette.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, ma'am--yes; I am young, no doubt. But I won't say but what
I've had a beau, young as I look.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you don't suppose that I want beaux, as you call them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, ma'am, as you wants 'em exactly. That's as may be.
There they are; and if they was to blow each other's brains out in
the gig to-night, I shouldn't be a bit surprised for one. There's
nothing won't quiet them at Oileymead to-night, if brandy-and-water
don't do it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) said this, Jeannette slipt into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) chair, and
held up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) hands in token of the intensity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) fears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you silly child, they're not going home together at all. Did
not the Captain go away first?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Captain did go away first, certainly; but I thought perhaps it
was to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) pistols and fighting things ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They won't fight, Jeannette. Gentlemen have given over fighting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have they, ma'am? That makes it much easier for ladies, no doubt.
Perhaps them peaceable ways will come down to such as us in time.
It'd be a comfort, I know, to them as are quiet given, like me. I
hate to see men knocking each other's heads about,--I do. So Mr.
Cheesacre and the Captain won't fight, ma'am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course they won't, you little fool, you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear; I was so sure we should have had the papers all full of
it,--and perhaps one of them stretched upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) bloody bier! I wonder
which it would have been? I always made up my mind that the Captain
wouldn't be wounded in any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) wital parts--unless it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
heart, you know, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why should they quarrel at all, Jeannette? It is the most
foolish thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, ma'am, I don't know about that. What else is they to do?
There's some things as you can cry halves about, but there's no
crying halves about this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About what, Jeannette?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Why, about you, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jeannette, I wonder how you can say such things; as if I, in my
position, had ever said a word to encourage either of them. You know
it's not true, Jeannette, and you shouldn't say so.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>Whereupon Mrs.
Greenow put her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) handkerchief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) eyes, and Jeannette, probably in
token of contrition, put her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) apron to hers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure, ma'am, no lady could have behaved better through it than
you have done, and goodness knows you have been tried hard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I have, Jeannette.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if gentlemen will make fools of themselves, it isn't your fault;
is it, ma'am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I'm so sorry that they should have quarrelled. They were such
dear friends, you know;--quite all in all to each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When you've settled which it's to be, ma'am, that'll all come right
again,--seeing that gentlefolks like them have given up fighting, as
you say.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then there was a little pause. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose, ma'am, it won't
be Mr. Cheesacre? To be sure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)'s a man as is uncommonly well to do
in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's all that to me, Jeannette? I shall ever regard Mr. Cheesacre
as a dear friend who has been very good to me at a time of trouble;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)'ll never be more than that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it'll be the Captain, ma'am? I'm sure, for my part, I've always
thought the Captain was the nicer gentleman of the two,--and have
always said so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)'s nothing to me, girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And as for money,--what's the good of having more than enough? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
can bring love, you can bring money; can't you, ma'am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)'s nothing to me, girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>repeated Mrs. Greenow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) will be?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>said Jeannette, plainly asking a question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm sure! What's the world come to, I wonder, when you sit
yourself down there, and cross-examine your mistress in that way! Get
to bed, will you? It's near ten o'clock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I haven't said anything amiss, ma'am;''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>and Jeannette rose
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) seat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's my fault for encouraging you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow. <div class="bookquote">``Go
down-stairs and finish your work, do; and then take yourself off to
bed. Next week we shall have to be packing up, and there'll be all my
things to see to before that.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>So Jeannette got up and departed, and
after some few further thoughts about Captain Bellfield, Mrs. Greenow
herself went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) bedroom.

<p/>Mr. Cheesacre, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) drove back to Oileymead alone from Norwich,
after dining with Mrs. Greenow, had kept himself hot, and almost
comfortable, with passion against Bellfield; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) heat, if not
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) comfort, had been sustained by his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) seeing the Captain, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
portmanteau, escaping just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) own homestead. But early
on the following morning his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) mind reverted to Mrs. Greenow, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
remembered, with anything but satisfaction, some of the hard things
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had made mistakes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) manner of
wooing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was quite aware of that now, and was determined that they
should be rectified for the future. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had rebuked him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) for having
said nothing about his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) love. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) would instantly mend that fault.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had bidden him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) not to be so communicative about his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) wealth.
Henceforth he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) would be dumb on that subject. Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) could
not but think that the knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) circumstances which the lady
already possessed, must be of service to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) can't really
like a poor beggarly wretch who hasn't got a shilling,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) said to
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was very far from feeling that the battle was already
lost. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) last word to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had been an assurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) friendship;
and then why should she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) have been at so much trouble to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) the
way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) ought to address her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were herself indifferent
as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) addresses? He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was, no doubt, becoming tired of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
courtship, and heartily wished that the work were over; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was
not minded to give it up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) therefore prepared himself for another
attack, and took himself into Norwich without seeking counsel from
any one. He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) could not trust himself to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could really
wish to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) after all the encouragement she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>). On
this occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) put on no pink shirt or shiny boots, being deterred
from doing so by a remembrance of Captain Bellfield's ridicule;
but, nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) dressed himself with considerable care. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
clothed his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) nether person in knickerbockers, with tight, leathern,
bright-coloured gaiters round his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) legs, being conscious of certain
manly graces and symmetrical proportions which might, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) thought,
stand him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) in good stead. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) put on a new shooting-coat, the
buttons on which were elaborate, and a wonderful waistcoat worked
over with foxes' heads. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) completed his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) toilet with a round,
low-crowned hat, with dog's-skin gloves, and a cutting whip. Thus
armed he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) went forth resolved to conquer or to die,--as far as death
might result from any wound which Mrs. Greenow might be able to give
him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) waited, on this occasion, for the coming of no market-day;
indeed, the journey into the city was altogether special, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was
desirous that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) should know that such was the case. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) drove at a
great pace into the inn-yard, threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) reins to the ostler, took
just one glass of cherry-brandy at the bar, and then marched off
across the market-place to the Close, with quiet and decisive steps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that you, Cheesacre?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a friendly voice, in one of the narrow
streets. <div class="bookquote">``Who expected to see you in Norwich on a Thursday!''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>It was
Grimsby, the son of old Grimsby of Hatherwich, a country gentleman,
and one, therefore, to whom Cheesacre would generally pay much
respect; but on this occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) did not even pull up for an instant,
or moderate his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) pace. <div class="bookquote">``A little bit of private business,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) said,
and marched onwards with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) head towards the Close. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not going
to be afraid of a woman--not if I know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) said to himself;
but, nevertheless, at a certain pastrycook's, of whose shop he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had
knowledge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) pulled up and had another glass of cherry-brandy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Greenow is at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) said to Jeannette, not deigning to ask
any question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, sir; she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) is at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>said Jeannette, conscious that some
occasion had arrived; and in another second he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was in the presence of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) angel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Cheesacre, whoever expected to see you in Norwich on a Thursday?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) welcomed him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), using almost the same words
as his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) friend had done in the street. Why should not he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) come into
Norwich on a Thursday, as well as any one else? Did they suppose
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was tied for ever to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) ploughs and carts? He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was minded to
conduct himself with a little spirit on this occasion, and to improve
the opinion which Mrs. Greenow had formed about him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>). On this account
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) somewhat boldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no knowing when I may be in Norwich, Mrs. Greenow, or when
I mayn't. I'm one of those men of whom nobody knows anything certain,
except that I pay as I go.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was not to
make any more boasts about his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) money, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) endeavoured to cover the
error. <div class="bookquote">``There's one other thing they may all know if they please, but
we won't say what that is just at present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't you sit down, Mr. Cheesacre?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,--thank you,--I will sit down for a few minutes if you'll let
me, Mrs. Greenow. Mrs. Greenow, I'm in such a state of mind that I must
put an end to it, or else I shall be going mad, and doing somebody a
damage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me! what has happened to you? You're going out shooting,
presently; are you not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>and Mrs. Greenow looked down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) garments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Mrs. Greenow, I'm not going out shooting. I put on these things
because I thought I might take a shot as I came along. But I couldn't
bring myself to do it, and then I wouldn't take them off again. What
does it matter what a man wears?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least, so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is decent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I'm always that, Mrs. Greenow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, yes. More than that, I should say. I consider you to be
rather gay in your attire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't pretend to anything of that kind, Mrs. Greenow. I like to
be nice, and all that kind of thing. There are people who think that
because a man farms his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own land, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be always in the muck. It
is the case, of course, with those who have to make their rent and
living out of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was again treading on
forbidden ground, and stopped himself. <div class="bookquote">``But it don't matter what a
man wears if his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart isn't easy within him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know why you should speak in that way, Mr. Cheesacre; but
it's what I have felt every hour since--since Greenow left me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Cheesacre was rather at a loss to know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) should begin. This
allusion to the departed one did not at all assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had so
often told the widow that care killed a cat, and that a live dog was
better than a dead lion; and had found so little efficacy in the
proverbs, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) did not care to revert to them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was aware that
some more decided method of proceeding was now required. Little hints
at love-making had been all very well in the earlier days of their
acquaintance; but there must be something more than little hints
before he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) could hope to bring the matter to a favourable conclusion.
The widow herself had told him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) ought to talk about love; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had taken two glasses of cherry-brandy, hoping that they might
enable him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) to do so. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had put on a coat with brilliant buttons, and
new knickerbockers, in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) might be master of the occasion.
He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was resolved to call a spade a spade, and to speak boldly of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
passion; but how was he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) to begin? There was the difficulty. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was
now seated in a chair, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) remained silent for a minute or
two, while she (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) smoothed her (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) eyebrows with her (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) handkerchief after her (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
last slight ebullition of grief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Greenow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) exclaimed at last, jumping up before her (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``dearest
Mrs. Greenow; darling Mrs. Greenow, will you be my wife? There! I
have said it at last, and I mean it. Everything that I've got shall
be yours. Of course I speak specially of my hand and heart. As for
love;--oh, Arabella, if you only knew me! I don't think there's a
man in Norfolk better able to love a woman than I am. Ever since I
first saw you at Yarmouth, I've been in love to that extent that I've
not known what I've been about. If you'll ask them at home, they'll
tell you that I've not been able to look after anything about the
place,--not as it should be done. I haven't really. I don't suppose
I've opened the wages book half a dozen times since last July.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And has that been my fault, Mr. Cheesacre?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word it has. I can't move about anywhere without thinking
about you. My mind's made up; I won't stay at Oileymead unless you
will come and be its mistress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not stay at Oileymead?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed. I'll let the place, and go and travel somewheres. What's
the use of my hanging on there without the woman of my heart? I
couldn't do it, Mrs. Greenow; I couldn't, indeed. Of course I've got
everything there that money can buy,--but it's all of no use to a man
that's in love. Do you know, I've come quite to despise money and
stock, and all that sort of thing. I haven't had my banker's book
home these last three months. Only think of that now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how can I help you, Mr. Cheesacre?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just say one word, and the thing'll be done. Say you'll be my wife?
I'll be so good to you. I will, indeed. As for your fortune, I don't
care that for it! I'm not like somebody else; it's yourself I want.
You shall be my pet, and my poppet, and my dearest little duck all
the days of your life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Mr. Cheesacre; it cannot be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why not? Look here, Arabella!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>At these words he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
chair, and coming immediately before her (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), went down on both knees
so close to her (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) as to prevent the possibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) escaping from
him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>). There could be no doubt as to the efficacy of the cherry-brandy.
There he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was, well down on his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) knees; but he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had not got down so
low without some little cracking and straining on the part of the
gaiters with which his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) legs were encompassed. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) passion, had
probably omitted to notice this; but Mrs. Greenow, who was more cool
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) present temperament, was painfully aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) might not be
able to rise with ease.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Cheesacre, don't make a fool of yourself. Get up,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, till you have told me that you will be mine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you'll remain there for ever, which will be inconvenient. I
won't have you take hold of my hand, Mr. Cheesacre. I tell you to have
done.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Whereupon his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) grasp upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) hand was released; but he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) made no
attempt to rise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw a man look so much like a fool in my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``If you don't get up, I'll push you over. There; don't you hear?
There's somebody coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div><p/>But Cheesacre, whose senses were less acute than the lady's, did not
hear. <div class="bookquote">``I'll never get up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``till you have bid me hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bid you play the fiddle. Get away from my knees, at any rate.
There;--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll be in the room now before--''


 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: Mr. Cheesacre disturbed.-RSB-


<p/>Cheesacre now did hear a sound of steps, and the door was opened
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) first futile attempt to get back to a standing
position. The door was opened, and Captain Bellfield entered. <div class="bookquote">``I
beg ten thousand pardons,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but as I did not see Jeannette,
I ventured to come in. May I venture to congratulate my friend
Cheesacre on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) success?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In the meantime Cheesacre had risen; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had done so slowly, and
with evident difficulty. <div class="bookquote">``I'll trouble you to leave the room, Captain
Bellfield,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'm particularly engaged with Mrs. Greenow, as
any gentleman might have seen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There wasn't the slightest difficulty in seeing it, old fellow,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain. <div class="bookquote">``Shall I wish you joy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll trouble you to leave the room, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre, walking up
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, if Mrs. Greenow will desire me to do so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the
Captain.

<p/>Then Mrs. Greenow felt herself called upon to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen, I must beg that you will not make my drawing-room a
place for quarrelling. Captain Bellfield, lest there should be any
misconception, I must beg you to understand that the position in
which you found Mr. Cheesacre was one altogether of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) own seeking.
It was not with my consent that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can easily believe that, Mrs. Greenow,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who cares what you believe, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cheesacre.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen! gentlemen! this is really unkind. Captain Bellfield, I
think I had better ask you to withdraw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By all means,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cheesacre.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As it is absolutely necessary that I should give Mr. Cheesacre a
definite answer after what has occurred--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain Bellfield, preparing to go. <div class="bookquote">``I'll take
another opportunity of paying my respects to you. Perhaps I might be
allowed to come this evening?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div><p/>To this Mrs. Greenow half assented with an uncertain nod, and then
the Captain went. As soon as the door was closed behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) back, Mr.
Cheesacre again prepared to throw himself into his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) former position,
but to this Mrs. Greenow decidedly objected. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) were allowed to
go down again, there was no knowing what force might be necessary to
raise him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Cheesacre,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``let there be an end to this
little farce between us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Farce!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) heart, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) legs
and knickerbockers well displayed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is certainly either a farce or a mistake. If the latter,--and I
have been at all to blame,--I ask your pardon most sincerely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you'll be Mrs. Cheesacre; won't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Mr. Cheesacre; no. One husband is enough for any woman, and mine
lies buried at Birmingham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, damn it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), in utter disgust at this further reference
to Mr. Greenow. The expression, at such a moment, militated against
courtesy; but even Mrs. Greenow herself felt that the poor man had
been subjected to provocation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us part friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), offering him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) hand.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), for there was something in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted to hide. I believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really did love her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), and
that at this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), even though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
learned that her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) fortune was gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you not give me your hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``in token that there is
no anger between us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do think about it again--do!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``If there's anything you
like to have changed, I'll change it at once. I'll give up Oileymead
altogether, if you don't like being so near the farm-yard. I'll give
up anything; so I will. Mrs. Greenow, if you only knew how I've set my
heart upon it!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And now, though his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back was turned, the whimpering
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice told plainly that tears were in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was a little touched. No woman would feel disposed to marry a man
simply because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried, and perhaps few women would be less likely
to give way to such tenderness than Mrs. Greenow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) understood men
and women too well, and had seen too much both of the world's rough
side and of its smooth side to fall into such a blunder as that; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was touched. <div class="bookquote">``My friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) said, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
arm, <div class="bookquote">``think no more of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I can't help thinking of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), almost blubbering in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
earnestness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), still touching him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``Why, Mr.
Cheesacre, how can you bring yourself to care for an old woman like
me, when so many pretty young ladies would give their eyes to get a
kind word from you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want any young lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's Charlie Fairstairs, who would make as good a wife as any
girl I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Psha! Charlie Fairstairs, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>a bride</b></font>)</div>The very idea of having such a
bride palmed off upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did something to restore him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manly
courage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or my niece, Kate Vavasor, who has a nice little fortune of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) own,
and who is as accomplished as she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) is good-looking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)'s nothing to me, Mrs. Greenow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's because you never asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) to be anything. If I get her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) to
come back to Yarmouth next summer, will you think about it? You want
a wife, and you couldn't do better if you searched all England over.
It would be so pleasant for us to be such near friends; wouldn't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And again she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Greenow, just at present there's only one woman in the world
that I can think of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that's my niece.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that's yourself. I'm a broken-hearted man,--I am, indeed. I
didn't ever think I should feel so much about a thing of the kind--I
didn't, really. I hardly know what to do with myself; but I suppose
I'd better go back to Oileymead.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had become so painfully
unconscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) new coat and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knickerbockers that it was
impossible not to pity him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I shall always hate the place now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
said,--<div class="bookquote">``always.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will pass away. You'd be as happy as a king there, if you'd
take Kate for your queen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what'll you do, Mrs. Greenow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall I do?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Yes; what will you do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is, if you marry Kate? Why, I'll come and stay with you half my
time, and nurse the children, as an old grand-aunt should.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But about--.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hesitated, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
thinking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean to take that man Bellfield, do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Mr. Cheesacre, that's rank jealousy. What right can you have to
ask me whether I shall take any man or no man? The chances are that I
shall remain as I am till I'm carried to my grave; but I'm not going
to give any pledge about it to you or to any one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know that man, Mrs. Greenow; you don't, indeed. I tell
it you as your friend. Does not it stand to reason, when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has got
nothing in the world, that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) must be a beggar? It's all very well
saying that when a man is courting a lady, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shouldn't say much
about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money; but you won't make me believe that any man will make
a good husband who hasn't got a shilling. And for lies, there's no
beating him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, then, has he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) been such a friend of yours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, because I've been foolish. I took up with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) just because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
looked pleasant, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you want to prevent me from doing the same thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you were to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Mrs. Greenow, it's my belief I should do
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a mischief; it is, really. I don't think I could stand it;--a
mean, skulking beggar! I suppose I'd better go now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, if that's the way you choose to talk about my friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Friends, indeed! Well, I won't say any more at present. I suppose if
I was to talk for ever it wouldn't be any good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and talk to Kate Vavasor for ever, Mr. Cheesacre.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>To this he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made no reply, but went forth from the house, and got
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gig, and drove himself home to Oileymead, thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
disappointment with all the bitterness of a young lover. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't
ever think I should ever care so much about anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
took himself up to bed that night.

<p/>That evening Captain Bellfield did call in the Close, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) would do, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was not admitted. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) mistress was very bad with
a headache,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>Jeannette said.




<p/>CHAPTER XLVIII.

<p/>Preparations for Lady Monk's Party.


<p/>Early in April, the Easter recess being all over, Lady Monk gave
a grand party in London. Lady Monk's town house was in Gloucester
Square. It was a large mansion, and Lady Monk's parties in London
were known to be very great affairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) usually gave two or three in
the season, and spent a large portion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) time and energy in so
arranging matters that her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) parties should be successful. As this was
her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) special line in life, a failure would have been very distressing
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>);--and we may also say very disgraceful, taking into
consideration, as we should do in forming our judgement on the
subject, the very large sums of Sir Cosmo's money which she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) spent in
this way. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) seldom did fail. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) knew how to select her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) days,
so as not to fall foul of other events. It seldom happened that
people could not come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) because of a division which occupied
all the Members of Parliament, or that they were drawn away by the
superior magnitude of some other attraction in the world of fashion.
This giving of parties was her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) business, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) had learned it
thoroughly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) worked at it harder than most men work at their
trades, and let us hope that the profits were consolatory.

<p/>It was generally acknowledged to be the proper thing to go to Lady
Monk's parties. There were certain people who were asked, and who
went as a matter of course,--people who were by no means on intimate
terms with Lady Monk, or with Sir Cosmo; but they were people to have
whom was the proper thing, and they were people who understood that
to go to Lady Monk's was the proper thing for them. The Duchess of
St. Bungay was always there, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) hated Lady Monk, and Lady Monk
always abused her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>); but a card was sent to the Duchess in the same way
as the Lord Mayor invites a Cabinet Minister to dinner, even though
the one man might believe the other to be a thief. And Mrs. Conway
Sparkes was generally there; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparkes</b></font>) went everywhere. Lady Monk did not
at all know why Mrs. Conway Sparkes was so favoured by the world;
but there was the fact, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparkes</b></font>) bowed to it. Then there were another
set, the members of which were or were not invited, according to
circumstances, at the time; and these were the people who were
probably the most legitimate recipients of Lady Monk's hospitality.
Old family friends of her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) husband were among the number. Let the
Tuftons come in April, and perhaps again in May; then they will not
feel their exclusion from that seventh heaven of glory,--the great
culminating crush in July. Scores of young ladies who really loved
parties belonged to this set. The mothers and aunts knew Lady Monk's
sisters and cousins. They accepted so much of Lady Monk's good
things as she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) vouchsafed them, and were thankful. Then there was
another lot, which generally became, especially on that great July
occasion, the most numerous of the three. It comprised all those
who made strong interest to obtain admittance within her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) ladyship's
house,--who struggled and fought almost with tooth and nail to get
invitations. Against these people Lady Monk carried on an internecine
war. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) not done so she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) would have been swamped by them, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) success would have been at an end; but yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) never dreamed of
shutting her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) doors against them altogether, or of saying boldly that
none such should hamper her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) staircases. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) must yield,
but her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) effort was made to yield to as few as might be possible. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) was first told by her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) factotum in these operations that Mr. Bott
wanted to come, she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) positively declined to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>). When it was
afterwards intimated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) that the Duchess of St. Bungay had made a
point of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) sneered at the Duchess, and did not even then yield.
But when at last it was brought home to her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) understanding that Mr.
Palliser wished it, and that Mr. Palliser probably would not come
himself unless his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wishes were gratified, she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) gave way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) was
especially anxious that Lady Glencora should come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) gathering,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) knew that Lady Glencora could not be had without Mr. Palliser.

<p/>It was very much desired by her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) that Lady Glencora should be there.
<div class="bookquote">``Burgo,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) nephew, one morning, <div class="bookquote">``look here.''  (<font color='red'><b>nephew</b></font>)</div>Burgo was
at the time staying with his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) aunt, in Gloucester Square, much to the
annoyance of Sir Cosmo, who had become heartily tired of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) nephew.
The aunt and the nephew had been closeted together more than once
lately, and perhaps they understood each other better now than they
had done down at Monkshade. The aunt had handed a little note to
Burgo, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) read and then threw back to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) is
not afraid of coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monk</b></font>)</div>said Lady Monk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) doesn't think much about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If that's what you really believe, you'd better give it up. Nothing
on earth would justify such a step on your part except a thorough
conviction that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) is attached to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div><p/>Burgo looked at the fireplace, almost savagely, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) aunt looked
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) very keenly. <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if there's to be an end of it,
let there be an end of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I'd better hang myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Burgo, I will not have you here if you talk to me in that way. I am
trying to help you once again; but if you look like that, and talk
like that, I will give it up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you'd better give it up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you becoming cowardly at last? With all your faults I never
expected that of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I am not a coward. I'd go out and fight him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) at two paces'
distance with the greatest pleasure in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know that's nonsense, Burgo. It's downright braggadocio. Men do
not fight now; nor at any time would a man be called upon to fight,
because you simply wanted to take his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). If you had done
it, indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How am I to do it? I'd do it to-morrow if it depended on me. No one
can say that I'm afraid of anybody or of anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose something in the matter depends on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) loves me,--if you mean that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, Burgo,''  (<font color='red'><b>the aunt</b></font>)</div>and the considerate aunt gave to the impoverished
and ruined nephew such counsel as she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), in accordance with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) lights,
was enabled to bestow. <div class="bookquote">``I think you were much wronged in that matter.
After what had passed I thought that you had a right to claim Lady
Glencora as your wife. Mr. Palliser, in my mind, behaved very wrongly
in stepping in between you and--you and such a fortune as hers, in
that way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) cannot expect that his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife should have any affection
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). There is nobody alive who has a greater horror of anything
improper in married women than I have. I have always shown it. When
Lady Madeline Madtop left her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) husband, I would never allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) to
come inside my doors again,--though I have no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ill-used her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
dreadfully, and there was nothing ever proved between her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) and Colonel
Graham. One can't be too particular in such matters. But here,
if you,--if you can succeed, you know, I shall always regard the
Palliser episode in Lady Glencora's life as a tragical accident. I
shall indeed. Poor dear! It was done exactly as they make nuns of
girls in Roman Catholic countries; and as I should think no harm
of helping a nun out of her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) convent, so I should think no harm of
helping her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) now. If you are to say anything to her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>), I think you might
have an opportunity at the party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div><p/>Burgo was still looking at the fireplace; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) sat on, looking and
still looking, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) said nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can think of what I have said, Burgo,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) aunt,
meaning that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) should get up and go. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) did not go. <div class="bookquote">``Have you
anything more that you wish to say to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got no money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo, still looking at the fireplace.

<p/>Lady Glencora's property was worth not less than fifty thousand
a year. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was a young man ambitious of obtaining that almost
incredible amount of wealth, and who once had nearly reached it, by
means of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) love. His (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) present obstacle consisted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) want of a
twenty-pound note! <div class="bookquote">``I've got no money.''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>The words were growled out
rather than spoken, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) eyes were never turned even for a moment
towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) aunt's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've never got any money,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), speaking almost with passion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I help it? I can't make money. If I had a couple of hundred
pounds, so that I could take her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>), I believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) would go with
me. It should not be my fault if she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) did not. It would have been all
right if she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) had come to Monkshade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got no money for you, Burgo. I have not five pounds belonging
to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you've got--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monk</b></font>)</div>said Lady Monk, interrupting him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would Cosmo lend it me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), hesitating to go on with that
suggestion which he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had been about to make. The Cosmo of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>)
spoke was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) uncle, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) cousin. No eloquence could have
induced his (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) uncle, Sir Cosmo, to lend him (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) another shilling. But the
son of the house was a man rich with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own wealth, and Burgo had
not taxed him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) for some years.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monk</b></font>)</div>said Lady Monk. <div class="bookquote">``I never see him (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>). Probably not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo. <div class="bookquote">``Fancy that a man should be ruined for two
hundred pounds, just at such a moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life as this!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was
a man bold by nature, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) did make his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) proposition. <div class="bookquote">``You have
jewels, aunt;--could you not raise it for me? I would redeem them
with the very first money that I got.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Monk rose in a passion when the suggestion was first made,
but before the interview was over she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) had promised that she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) would
endeavour to do something in the way of raising money for him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) yet,
once again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) favourite nephew, and the same almost to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) as a child of her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) own. With one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) own children indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>)
had quarrelled, and of the other, a married daughter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) rarely
saw much. Such love as she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) had to give she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) gave to Burgo, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>)
promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) the money though she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) must raise it by some
villanous falsehood to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) husband.

<p/>On the same morning Lady Glencora went to Queen Anne Street with the
purpose of inducing Alice to go to Lady Monk's party; but Alice would
not accede to the proposition, though Lady Glencora pressed it with
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) eloquence. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, <div class="bookquote">``that's absurd. Half the people there
won't know her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But they know her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) set, or know her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) friends,--or, at any rate, will
meet their own friends at her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) house. I should only bother you, and
should not in the least gratify myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The fact is, everybody will go who can, and I should have no sort
of trouble in getting a card for you. Indeed I should simply write a
note and say I meant to bring you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray don't do any such thing, for I certainly shall not go. I can't
conceive why you should wish it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Fitzgerald will be there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, altering her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) voice
altogether, and speaking in that low tone with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) used to win
Alice's heart down at Matching. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was sitting close over the fire,
leaning low, holding up her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) little hands as a screen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face, and
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) companion earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) will be there,
though nobody has told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That may be a reason for your staying away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, slowly,
<div class="bookquote">``but hardly a reason for my going with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Glencora would not condescend to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) friend in so many
words that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) protection. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could not bring herself to
say that, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) wished it to be understood. <div class="bookquote">``Ah! I thought you
would have gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be contrary to all my habits,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice: <div class="bookquote">``I never go to
people's houses when I don't know them. It's a kind of society which
I don't like. Pray do not ask me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! very well. If it must be so, I won't press it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora
had moved the position of one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) hands so as to get it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
pocket, and there had grasped a letter, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) still carried; but
when Alice said those last cold words, <div class="bookquote">``Pray do not ask me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
released the grasp, and left the letter where it was. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
won't bite me, at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) assumed that look of
childish drollery which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would sometimes put on, almost with a
grimace, but still with so much prettiness that no one who saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
would regret it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) certainly can't bite you, if you will not let him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Do you know, Alice, though they all say that Plantagenet is one of
the wisest men in London, I sometimes think that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is one of the
greatest fools. Soon after we came to town I told him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) that we had
better not go to that woman's house. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) understood me. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
simply said that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wished that I should do so. ``I hate anything out
of the way,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said. ``There can be no reason why my wife should not
go to Lady Monk's house as well as to any other.<div class="bookquote">'' There was an end of
it, you know, as far as anything I could do was concerned. But there
wasn't an end of it with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) insists that I shall go, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
sends my duenna with me. Dear Mrs. Marsham is to be there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monk</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>)'ll do you no harm, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not so sure of that, Alice. In the first place, one doesn't like
to be followed everywhere by a policeman, even though one isn't going
to pick a pocket. And then, the devil is so strong within me, that I
should like to dodge the policeman. I can fancy a woman being driven
to do wrong simply by a desire to show her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) policeman that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can be
too many for him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Glencora, you make me so wretched when you talk like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you go with me, then, so that I may have a policeman of my own

porter, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) I would not; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) asked why not, I said
that I preferred taking a friend of my own,--a young friend, I said,
and I then named you or my cousin, Lady Jane. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) I should
bring one or the other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And was he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) angry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) took it very quietly,--saying something, in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) calm way,
about hoping that I should get over a prejudice against one of
his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) earliest and dearest friends. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) twits at me because I don't
understand Parliament and the British Constitution, but I know more
of them than he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) does about a woman. You are quite sure you won't go,
then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice hesitated a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora; and there
was an amount of persuasion in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) accent which should, I think, have
overcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin's scruples.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is against the whole tenor of my life's way,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``And,
Glencora, I am not happy myself. I am not fit for parties. I
sometimes think that I shall never go into society again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's nonsense, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it is, but I cannot go now. I would if I really thought--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, interrupting her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I suppose I
shall get through it. If he (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) asks me to dance, I shall stand up with
him (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>), just as though I had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) before.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) remembered
the letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) pocket,--remembered that at this moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) bore
about with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) a written proposition from this man to go off with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband's house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had intended to show it to Alice
on this occasion; but as Alice had refused her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) request, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was glad
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had not done so. <div class="bookquote">``You'll come to me the morning after,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said
Lady Glencora, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) went. This Alice promised to do; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
was left alone.

<p/>Alice regretted,--regretted deeply that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had not consented to go
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin. After all, of what importance had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) objection
when compared with the cause for which her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) presence had been desired?
Doubtless she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would have been uncomfortable at Lady Monk's house;
but could she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) not have borne some hour or two of discomfort on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
friend's behalf? But, in truth, it was only after Lady Glencora had
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) began to understand the subject fully, and to feel
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) might possibly have been of service in a great danger. But
it was too late now. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) strove to comfort herself with the
reflection that a casual meeting at an evening party in London could
not be perilous in the same degree as a prolonged sojourn together in
a country house.




<p/>CHAPTER XLIX.

<p/>How Lady Glencora Went to Lady Monk's Party.


<p/>Lady Monk's house in Gloucester Square was admirably well adapted for
the giving of parties. It was a large house, and seemed to the eyes
of guests to be much larger than it was. The hall was spacious, and
the stairs went up in the centre, facing you as you entered the inner
hall. Round the top of the stairs there was a broad gallery, with an
ornamented railing, and from this opened the doors into the three
reception-rooms. There were two on the right, the larger of which
looked out backwards, and these two were connected by an archway, as
though made for folding-doors; but the doors, I believe, never were
there. Fronting the top of the staircase there was a smaller room,
looking out backwards, very prettily furnished, and much used by Lady
Monk when alone. It was here that Burgo had held that conference with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) aunt of which mention has been made. Below stairs there was the
great dining-room, on which, on these occasions, a huge buffet was
erected for refreshments,--what I may call a masculine buffet, as it
was attended by butlers and men in livery,--and there was a smaller
room looking out into the square, in which there was a feminine
battery for the dispensing of tea and such like smaller good things,
and from which female aid could be attained for the arrangement or
mending of dresses in a further sanctum within it. For such purposes
as that now on foot the house was most commodious. Lady Monk, on
these occasions, was moved by a noble ambition to do something
different from that done by her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) neighbours in similar circumstances,
and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) never came forward to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) guests. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>)
ensconced herself, early in the evening, in that room at the head of
the stairs, and there they who chose to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) made their way up to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>), and spoke their little speeches. They who thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) to be a
great woman,--and many people did think her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) to be great,--were wont
to declare that she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) never forgot those who did come, or those who did
not. And even they who desired to describe her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) as little,--for even
Lady Monk had enemies,--would hint that though she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) never came out
of the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) would rise from her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) chair and make a step towards
the door whenever any name very high in fashionable life greeted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) ears. So that a mighty Cabinet Minister, or a duchess in great
repute, or any special wonder of the season, could not fail of
entering her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) precincts and being seen there for a few moments. It
would, of course, happen that the doorway of her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) chamber would become
blocked; but there were precautions taken to avoid this inconvenience
as far as possible, and one man in livery was employed to go
backwards and forwards between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mistress and the outer world, so
as to keep the thread of a passage open.

<p/>But though Lady Monk was in this way enabled to rest herself during
her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) labours, there was much in her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) night's work which was not
altogether exhilarating. Ladies would come into her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) small room and
sit there by the hour, with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) had not the slightest wish
to hold conversation. The Duchess of St. Bungay would always be
there,--so that there was a special seat in one corner of the room
which was called the Duchess' stool. <div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't care a straw about
her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monk</b></font>)</div>Lady Monk had been heard to complain, <div class="bookquote">``if she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) would talk
to anybody. But nobody will talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), and then she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) listens to
everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monk</b></font>)</div><p/>There had been another word or two between Burgo Fitzgerald and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>)
aunt before the evening came, a word or two in the speaking of which
she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had found some difficulty. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was prepared with the money,--with
that two hundred pounds for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had asked,--obtained with what
wiles, and lies, and baseness of subterfuge I need not stop here to
describe. But she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was by no means willing to give this over into her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
nephew's hands without security. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was willing to advance him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) this
money; she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had been willing even to go through unusual dirt to get
it for him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was desirous that he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) should have it only for a
certain purpose. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) bind him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) down to spend it as she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) would
have it spent? Could she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) undertake to hand it to him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) as soon as Lady
Glencora should be in his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) power? Even though she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) could have brought
herself to say as much,--and I think she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) might also have done so
after what she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had said,--she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) could not have carried out such a
plan. In that case the want would be instant, and the action must be
rapid. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) therefore had no alternative but to entrust him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) with the
bank-notes at once. <div class="bookquote">``Burgo,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if I find that you deceive me
now, I will never trust you again.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
barely counted the money before he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) thrust it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) breast-pocket.
<div class="bookquote">``It is lent to you for a certain purpose, should you happen to want
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said, solemnly. <div class="bookquote">``I do happen to want it very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
answered. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) did not dare to say more; but as her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) nephew turned away
from her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) with a step that was quite light in its gaiety, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) almost
felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was already cozened. Let Burgo's troubles be as heavy
as they might be, there was something to him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) ecstatic in the touch of
ready money which always cured them for the moment.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) thrust the money
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) breast-pocket.-RSB-


<p/>On the morning of Lady Monk's party a few very uncomfortable words
passed between Mr. Palliser and his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your cousin is not going, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice is not going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you can give Mrs. Marsham a seat in your carriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Impossible, Plantagenet. I thought I had told you that I had
promised my cousin Jane.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you can take three.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I can't,--unless you would like me to sit out with the
coachman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something in this,--a tone of loudness, a touch of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
called to himself vulgarity,--which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) very angry. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) turned
away from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and looked as black as a thundercloud.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must know, Plantagenet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``that it is impossible for
three women dressed to go out in one carriage. I am sure you wouldn't
like to see me afterwards if I had been one of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You need not have said anything to Lady Jane when Miss Vavasor
refused. I had asked you before that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I had told you that I liked going with young women, and not with
old ones. That's the long and the short of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Glencora, I wish you would not use such expressions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! not the long and the short? It's good English. Quite as good
as Mr. Bott's, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) said in the House the other night that the
Government kept their accounts in a higgledy-piggledy way. You see, I
have been studying the debates, and you shouldn't be angry with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not angry with you. You speak like a child to say so. Then,
I suppose, the carriage must go for Mrs. Marsham after it has taken
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It shall go before. Jane will not be in a hurry, and I am sure I
shall not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) will think you very uncivil; that is all. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
could go with you when I heard that Miss Vavasor was not to be
there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, Plantagenet, you shouldn't have told her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) so, and that's the
long--; but I mustn't say that. The truth is this, if you give me any
orders I'll obey them,--as far as I can. If I can't I'll say so. But
if I'm left to go by my own judgement, it's not fair that I should be
scolded afterwards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never scolded you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you have. You have told me that I was uncivil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would think you so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, if it's only what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) thinks, I don't care two straws about
it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) may have the carriage to herself if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) likes, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) shan't
have me in it,--not unless I'm ordered to go. I don't like her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), and I
won't pretend to like her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). My belief is that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) follows me about to
tell you if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) thinks that I do wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Glencora!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that odious baboon with the red bristles does the same
thing,--only he (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) goes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) doesn't dare to go to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Plantagenet/Plantagenet Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/>Plantagenet Palliser was struck wild with dismay. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) understood well
who it was whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife intended to describe; but that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should
have spoken of any man as a baboon with red bristles, was terrible to
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was beginning to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hardly knew how to manage
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife. And the picture she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had drawn was very distressing to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had no mother; neither had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had wished that Mrs. Marsham
should give to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) some of that matronly assistance and guidance
which a mother does give to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) young married daughter. It was true,
too, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew, that a word or two as to some socially domestic
matters had filtered through to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from Mr. Bott, down at Matching
Priory, but only in such a way as to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) to see what counsel
it was needful that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) should give. As for espionage over his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>)
wife,--no man could despise it more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) did! No man would be less
willing to resort to it! And now his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife was accusing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of keeping
spies, both male and female.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Glencora!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said again; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopped, not knowing what to
say to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, it's better you should know at once what I feel about
it. I don't suppose I'm very good; indeed I dare say I'm bad enough,
but these people about me won't make me any better. The duennas don't
make the Spanish ladies worth much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Duennas!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>After that, Lady Glencora sat herself down, and Mr.
Palliser stood for some moments looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>).

<p/>It ended in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) making her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) a long speech, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said a good
deal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) own justice and forbearance, and something also of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
frivolity and childishness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) only complaint of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was too young, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) did so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) made a little
grimace,--not to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), but to herself, as though saying to herself
that that was all he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) knew about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) did not notice it, or, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
did, his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) notice did not stop his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) eloquence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
was far from keeping any watch over her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), and declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had
altogether mistaken Mrs. Marsham's character. Then there was another
little grimace. <div class="bookquote">``There's somebody has mistaken it worse than I have,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the grimace said. Of the bristly baboon he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) condescended to say
nothing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wound up by giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) a cold kiss, and saying that
he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) would meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) at Lady Monk's.

<p/>When the evening came,--or rather the night,--the carriage went
first for Mrs. Marsham, and having deposited her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) at Lady Monk's, went
back to Park Lane for Lady Glencora. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had herself driven to
St. James's Square, to pick up Lady Jane, so that altogether the
coachman and horses did not have a good time of it. <div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)'d
keep a separate carriage for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) cousin
Jane,--having perceived that her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) servants were not in a good humour.
<div class="bookquote">``That would be expensive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Jane/Jane</b></font>)</div>said Lady Jane. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it would be
expensive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would not condescend to make any
remark as to the non-importance of such expense to a man so wealthy
as her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband, knowing that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wealth was, in fact, hers. Never to
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) or to any other,--not even to herself,--had she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) hinted that much
was due to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had been magnificent as an heiress. There
were many things about this woman that were not altogether what a
husband might wish. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not softly delicate in all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ways; but
in disposition and temper she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was altogether generous. I do not know
that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was at all points a lady, but had Fate so willed it she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
would have been a thorough gentleman.

<p/>Mrs. Marsham was by no means satisfied with the way in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) was
treated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) would not have cared to go at all to Lady Monk's party
had she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) supposed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) would have to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) entry there alone.
With Lady Glencora she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would have seemed to receive some of that
homage which would certainly have been paid to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) companion. The
carriage called, moreover, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was fully ready, and the
footman, as he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) stood at the door to hand her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) in, had been very sulky.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) understood it all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) knew that Lady Glencora had positively
declined her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) companionship; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) resolved to be revenged, such
resolution on her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) part was only natural. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) reached Lady Monk's
house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) had to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) way up stairs all alone. The servants
called her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) Mrs. Marsh, and under that name she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) got passed on into the
front drawing-room. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) sat down, not having seen Lady Monk,
and meditated over her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) injuries.

<p/>It was past eleven before Lady Glencora arrived, and Burgo Fitzgerald
had begun to think that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) evil stars intended that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) should never
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had been wickedly baulked at Monkshade, by what
influence he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had never yet ascertained; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) thought that the
same influence must be at work to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) again away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) aunt's
house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had settled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) mind no accurate plan of a campaign; he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>)
had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) thoughts no fixed arrangement by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) might do the
thing which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) meditated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had attempted to make some such plan;
but, as is the case with all men to whom thinking is an unusual
operation, concluded at last that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had better leave it to the
course of events. It was, however, obviously necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) should
see Lady Glencora before the course of events could be made to do
anything for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), making his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) proposition in
bold terms, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) felt that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) were utterly decided against him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>),
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) anger at his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) suggestion, or at least her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) refusal, would have
been made known to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) in some way. Silence did not absolutely give
consent, but it seemed to show that consent was not impossible. From
ten o'clock to past eleven he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) stood about on the staircase of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>)
aunt's house, waiting for the name which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) was desirous of hearing,
and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) almost feared to hear. Men spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>), and women also,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) hardly answered. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) aunt once called him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) room, and
with a cautionary frown on her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) brow, bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) go dance. <div class="bookquote">``Don't look
so dreadfully preoccupied,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) in a whisper. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>)
shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) head at her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), almost savagely, and went away, and did not
dance. Dance! How was he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) to dance with such an enterprise as that
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) mind? Even to Burgo Fitzgerald the task of running away
with another man's wife had in it something which prevented dancing.
Lady Monk was older, and was able to regulate her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) feelings with more
exactness. But Burgo, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) could not dance, went down into the
dining-room and drank. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) took a large beer-glass full of champagne
and soon after that another. The drink did not flush his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) cheeks or
make his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) forehead red, or bring out the sweat-drops on his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) brow, as
it does with some men; but it added a peculiar brightness to his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) blue
eyes. It was by the light of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) eyes that men knew when Burgo had
been drinking.

<p/>At last, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was still in the supper room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) heard Lady
Glencora's name announced. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had already seen Mr. Palliser come in
and make his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) way up-stairs some quarter of an hour before; but as
to that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was indifferent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had known that the husband was to be
there. When the long-expected name reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) ears, his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) heart seemed
to jump within him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). What, on the spur of the moment, should he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) do?
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would be doing,--that something should be
done, let it be what it might,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hurried to the dining-room door,
and was just in time to see and be seen as Lady Glencora was passing
up the stairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was just above him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) got himself out into the
hall, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could not absolutely greet her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hand; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), and caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) eye. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) looked up, and moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) in token of salutation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) looked down at him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), and the
expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) face altered visibly as her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) glance met his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
barely bowed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>),--with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) eyes rather than with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) head, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) flattered himself that there was, at any rate, no anger in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
countenance. How beautiful he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) gazed up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), leaning
against the wall as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) stood, and watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) slow
way up the stairs! She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) eyes were on her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), and where the
stairs turned she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could not restrain herself from one other glance.
As her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) eyes fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) again, his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) mouth opened, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) fancied that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could hear the faint sigh that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) uttered. It was a glorious
mouth, such as the old sculptors gave to their marble gods! And
Burgo, if it was so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had not heart enough to love truly, could
look as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) loved. It was not in him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) deceit,--or what men call
acting. The expression came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) naturally, though it expressed so
much more than there was within; as strong words come to some men who
have no knowledge that they are speaking strongly. At this moment
Burgo Fitzgerald looked as though it were possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) might die
of love.

<p/>Lady Glencora was met at the top of the stairs by Lady Monk, who came
out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>), almost into the gallery, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) sweetest smile,--so
that the newly-arrived guest, of course, entered into the small
room. There sat the Duchess of St. Bungay on her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) stool in the corner,
and there, next to the Duchess, but at the moment engaged in no
conversation, stood Mr. Bott. There was another lady there, who
stood very high in the world, and whom Lady Monk was very glad to
welcome--the young Marchioness of Hartletop. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) was in slight
mourning; for her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) father-in-law, the late Marquis, had died no
t yet quite six months since. Very beautiful she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) was, and one whose
presence at their houses ladies and gentlemen prized alike. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) never
said silly things, like the Duchess, never was troublesome as to
people's conduct to her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>), was always gracious, yet was never led away
into intimacies, was without peer the best-dressed woman in London,
and yet gave herself no airs;--and then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was so exquisitely
beautiful. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) smile was loveliness itself. There were, indeed,
people who said that it meant nothing; but then, what should the
smile of a young married woman mean? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not been born in the
purple, like Lady Glencora, her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) father being a country clergyman who
had never reached a higher grade than that of an archdeacon; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
knew the ways of high life, and what an exigeant husband would demand
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), much better than poor Glencora. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would have spoken of no
man as a baboon with a bristly beard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) never talked of the long
and the short of it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) did not wander out o' nights in winter among
the ruins. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) made no fast friendship with ladies whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) lord did
not like. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had once, indeed, been approached by a lover since she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
had been married,--Mr. Palliser himself having been the offender,--but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had turned the affair to infinite credit and profit, had gained
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband's closest confidence by telling him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) of it all, had yet
not brought on any hostile collision, and had even dismissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
lover without annoying him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). But then Lady Hartletop was a miracle of
a woman!

<p/>Lady Glencora was no miracle. Though born in the purple, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was
made of ordinary flesh and blood, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) entered Lady Monk's
little room, hardly knew how to recover herself sufficiently for
the purposes of ordinary conversation. <div class="bookquote">``Dear Lady Glencora, do come
in for a moment to my den. We were so sorry not to have you at
Monkshade. We heard such terrible things about your health.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady
Glencora said that it was only a cold,--a bad cold. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes; we
heard,--something about moonlight and ruins. So like you, you know.
I love that sort of thing, above all people; but it doesn't do;
does it? Circumstances are so exacting. I think you know Lady
Hartletop;--and there's the Duchess of St. Bungay. Mr. Palliser was
here five minutes since.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>Then Lady Monk was obliged to get to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>)
door again and Lady Glencora found herself standing close to Lady
Hartletop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We saw Mr. Palliser just pass through,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Hartletop</b></font>)</div>said Lady Hartletop, who was
able to meet and speak of the man who had dared to approach her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartletop</b></font>) with
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love, without the slightest nervousness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) should be here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a great crowd,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Hartletop</b></font>)</div>said Lady Hartletop. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't think London
was so full.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very great.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, and then they had said to each
other all that society required. Lady Glencora, as we know, could
talk with imprudent vehemence by the hour together if she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
companion; but the other lady seldom committed herself by more words
than she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had uttered now,--unless it was to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tirewoman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How very well you are looking,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>said the Duchess. <div class="bookquote">``And I heard you
had been so ill.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Of that midnight escapade among the ruins it was
fated that Lady Glencora should never hear the last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How d'ye do, Lady Glencowrer?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sounded in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) ear, and there was a
great red paw stuck out for her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) to take. But after what had passed
between Lady Glencora and her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband to-day about Mr. Bott, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was
determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would not take Mr. Bott's hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you, Mr. Bott?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I think I'll look for Mr. Palliser
in the back room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Lady Glencora,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>whispered the Duchess, in an ecstasy of agony.
Lady Glencora turned and bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) head to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) stout friend. <div class="bookquote">``Do let
me go away with you. There's that woman, Mrs. Conway Sparkes, coming,
and you know how I hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparkes</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had nothing to do but to take the
Duchess under her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) wing, and they passed into the large room together.
It is, I think, more than probable that Mrs. Conway Sparkes had been
brought in by Lady Monk as the only way of removing the Duchess from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) stool.

<p/>Just within the dancing-room Lady Glencora found her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband,
standing in a corner, looking as though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) were making calculations.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going away,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), coming up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I only just came
because I said I would. Shall you be late?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no; I suppose not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you dance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps once,--just to show that I'm not an old woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't heat yourself. Good-bye.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went, and in the crush of
the doorway he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) passed Burgo Fitzgerald, whose eye was intently fixed
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) looked at Burgo, and some thought of that young
man's former hopes flashed across his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mind,--some remembrance, too,
of a caution that had been whispered to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); but for no moment did a
suspicion come to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ought to stop and watch by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife.




<p/>CHAPTER L.

<p/>How Lady Glencora Came Back from Lady Monk's Party.


<p/>Burgo Fitzgerald remained for a minute or two leaning where we
last saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>),--against the dining-room wall at the bottom of the
staircase; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) did so some thoughts that were almost solemn
passed across his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) mind, This thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) was about to do, or to
attempt,--was it in itself a good thing, and would it be good for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) pretended to love? What would be her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) future if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) consented
now to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>), and to divide herself from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) husband? Of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
own future he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thought not at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had never done so. Even when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
had first found himself attracted by the reputation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) wealth, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
cannot be said to have looked forward in any prudential way to coming
years. His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) desire to put himself in possession of so magnificent
a fortune had simply prompted him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might have been prompted
to play for a high stake at a gaming-table. But now, during these
moments, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did think a little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) be happy, simply
because he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), when all women should cease to acknowledge
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>); when men would regard her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) as one degraded and dishonoured; when
society should be closed against her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>); when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) would be driven to
live loudly because the softness and graces of quiet life would be
denied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)? Burgo knew well what must be the nature of such a
woman's life in such circumstances. Would Glencora be happy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
while living such a life simply because he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)? And, under such
circumstances, was it likely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) would continue to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)? Did
he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) not know himself to be the most inconstant of men, and the least
trustworthy? Leaning thus against the wall at the bottom of the
stairs he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) did ask himself all these questions with something of true
feeling about his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) heart, and almost persuaded himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had
better take his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) hat and wander forth anywhere into the streets. It
mattered little what might become of himself. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) could drink
himself out of the world, it might be an end of things that would be
not altogether undesirable.

<p/>But then the remembrance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) aunt's two hundred pounds came upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), which money he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) even now had about him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) person, and a
certain idea of honour told him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was bound to do that for
which the money had been given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>). As to telling his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) aunt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
had changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) mind, and, therefore, refunding the money--no such
thought as that was possible to him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)! To give back two hundred pounds
entire,--two hundred pounds which were already within his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) clutches,
was not within the compass of Burgo's generosity. Remembering the
cash, he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) told himself that hesitation was no longer possible to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>). So he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) gathered himself up, stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) hands over his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) head,
uttered a sigh that was audible to all around him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), and took himself
up-stairs.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) looked in at his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) aunt's room, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) and was seen by
her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Well, Burgo,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said, with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) sweetest smile, <div class="bookquote">``have you been
dancing?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) turned away from her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) without answering her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), muttering
something between his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) teeth about a cold-blooded Jezebel,--which, if
she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had heard it, would have made her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) think him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) the most ungrateful
of men. But she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) did not hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), and smiled still as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) went away,
saying something to Mrs. Conway Sparkes as to the great change for the
better which had taken place in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparkes</b></font>) nephew's conduct.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no knowing who may not reform,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparkes/Mrs. Conway Sparkes</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparkes, with an
emphasis which seemed to Lady Monk to be almost uncourteous.

<p/>Burgo made his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) way first into the front room and then into the
larger room where the dancing was in progress, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) saw Lady
Glencora standing up in a quadrille with the Marquis of Hartletop.
Lord Hartletop was a man not much more given to conversation than
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartletop</b></font>) wife, and Lady Glencora seemed to go through her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) work with very
little gratification either in the dancing or in the society of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
partner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was simply standing up to dance, because, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had
told Mr. Palliser, ladies of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) age generally do stand up on such
occasions. Burgo watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) crossed and re-crossed the room,
and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) presence. It made no change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>),
except that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) became even somewhat less animated than she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had been
before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would not seem to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), nor would she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) allow herself to
be driven into a pretence of a conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) partner because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was there. <div class="bookquote">``I will go up to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at once, and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to waltz,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>Burgo said to himself, as soon as the last figure of the quadrille
was in action. <div class="bookquote">``Why should I not ask her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as well as any other woman?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Hartletop/Hartletop</b></font>)</div>Then the music ceased, and after a minute's interval Lord Hartletop
took away his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartletop</b></font>) partner on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartletop</b></font>) arm into another room. Burgo, who had
been standing near the door, followed them at once. The crowd was
great, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) could not get near them or even keep them in sight,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was aware of the way in which they were going.

<p/>It was five minutes after this when he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) again saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartletop</b></font>), and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartletop</b></font>)
was seated on a cane bench in the gallery, and an old woman was
standing close to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). It was Mrs. Marsham cautioning
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) against some petty imprudence, and Lady Glencora was telling that
lady that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) needed no such advice, in words almost as curt as those
I have used. Lord Hartletop had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), feeling that, as far as
that was concerned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartletop</b></font>) had done his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartletop</b></font>) duty for the night. Burgo knew
nothing of Mrs. Marsham,--had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) before, and was quite
unaware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) had any special connection with Mr. Palliser. It was
impossible, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) thought, to find Lady Glencora in a better position
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) purpose, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) way up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) through the crowd, and
muttering some slight inaudible word, offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That will do very well thank you, Mrs. Marsham,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora said
at this moment. <div class="bookquote">``Pray, do not trouble yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) gave
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) hand to Fitzgerald. Mrs. Marsham, though unknown to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>), knew with
quite sufficient accuracy who he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) was, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) history, as far as
it concerned her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) friend's wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) had learned the whole story of
the loves of Burgo and Lady Glencora. Though Mr. Palliser had never
mentioned that man's name to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was well aware that her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) duty
as a duenna would make it expedient that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) should keep a doubly
wary eye upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) should he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) come near the sheepfold. And there he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was,
close to them, almost leaning over them, with the hand of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) late
lady love,--the hand of Mr. Palliser's wife,--within his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) own! How Lady
Glencora might have carried herself at this moment had Mrs. Marsham
not been there, it is bootless now to surmise; but it may be well
understood that under Mrs. Marsham's immediate eye all her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) resolution
would be in Burgo's favour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) softly and kindly, and
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) uttered no articulate word, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) countenance seemed to show
that the meeting was not unpleasant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you waltz?''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo,--asking it not at all as though it were
a special favour,--asking it exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) might have done had they
been in the habit of dancing with each other every other night for
the last three months.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think Lady Glencora will waltz to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marsham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Marsham,
very stiffly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) certainly did not know her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) business as a duenna, or
else the enormity of Burgo's proposition had struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) so forcibly
as to take away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) all her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) presence of mind. Otherwise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>)
must have been aware that such an answer from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) would surely drive
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) friend's wife into open hostility.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why not, Mrs. Marsham?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora rising from her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) seat.
<div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't I waltz to-night? I rather think I shall, the more
especially as Mr. Fitzgerald waltzes very well.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Thereupon she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
hand upon Burgo's arm.

<p/>Mrs. Marsham made still a little effort,--a little effort that was
probably involuntary. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) hand, and laid it on Lady
Glencora's left shoulder, looking into her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) did so with
all the severity of caution of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was mistress. Lady Glencora
shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) duenna off angrily. Whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would put her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) fate into
the hands of this man who was now touching her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), or whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would
not, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had not as yet decided; but of this she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was very sure,
that nothing said or done by Mrs. Marsham should have any effect in
restraining her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>).

<p/>What could Mrs. Marsham do? Mr. Palliser was gone. Some rumour of
that proposed visit to Monkshade, and the way in which it had been
prevented, had reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) ear. Some whispers had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) that
Fitzgerald still dared to love, as married, the woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had
loved before she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) was married. There was a rumour about that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) still
had some hope. Mrs. Marsham had never believed that Mr. Palliser's
wife would really be false to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) vows. It was not in fear of any such
catastrophe as a positive elopement that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) had taken upon herself
the duty of duenna. Lady Glencora would, no doubt, require to be
pressed down into that decent mould which it would become the wife
of a Mr. Palliser to assume as her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) form; and this pressing down, and
this moulding, Mrs. Marsham thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) could accomplish. It had
not hitherto occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) might be required to guard Mr.
Palliser from positive dishonour; but now--now she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) hardly knew what
to think about it. What should she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) do? To whom should she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) go? And
then she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) saw Mr. Bott looming large before her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) on the top of the
staircase.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: Mr. Bott on the watch.-RSB-


<p/>In the meantime Lady Glencora went off towards the dancers, leaning
on Burgo's arm. <div class="bookquote">``Who is that woman?''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo. They were the first
words he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), though since he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had last seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had
written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) that letter which even now she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) carried about her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
voice in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) ears sounded as it used to sound when their intimacy
had been close, and questions such as that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had asked were common
between them. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) answer was of the same nature. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, such an
odious woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) name is Mrs. Marsham; she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) is my bête
noire.''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>And then they were actually dancing, whirling round the room
together, before a word had been said of that which was Burgo's
settled purpose, and which at some moments was her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) settled purpose
also.

<p/>Burgo waltzed excellently, and in old days, before her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) marriage, Lady
Glencora had been passionately fond of dancing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) seemed to give
herself up to it now as though the old days had come back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>).
Lady Monk, creeping to the intermediate door between her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) den and
the dancing-room, looked in on them, and then crept back again. Mrs.
Marsham and Mr. Bott standing together just inside the other door,
near to the staircase, looked on also--in horror.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) shouldn't have gone away and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bott, almost
hoarsely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But who could have thought it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marsham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Marsham. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I
didn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you'd better tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bott.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't know where to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marsham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Marsham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean now at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bott;--and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Do
you think it is as bad as that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what to think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marsham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Marsham.

<p/>The waltzers went on till they were stopped by want of breath. <div class="bookquote">``I
am so much out of practice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora; <div class="bookquote">``I didn't think--I
should have been able--to dance at all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) put up her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) face,
and slightly opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) mouth, and stretched her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) nostrils,--as ladies
do as well as horses when the running has been severe and they want
air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll take another turn,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Presently,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), beginning to have some thought in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) mind
as to whether Mrs. Marsham was watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>). Then there was a little
pause, after which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) spoke in an altered voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does it put you in mind of old days?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>).

<p/>It was, of course, necessary for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) should bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) to some
thought of the truth. It was all very sweet, that dancing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>),
as they used to dance, without any question as to the reason why it
was so; that sudden falling into the old habits, as though everything
between this night and the former nights had been a dream; but this
would not further his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) views. The opportunity had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) must use, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) intended ever to use such opportunity. There was
the two hundred pounds in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) pocket, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) did not intend to give
back. <div class="bookquote">``Does it put you in mind of `old days?'''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) said.

<p/>The words roused her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) sleep at once, and dissipated her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>)
dream. The facts all rushed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) in an instant; the letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>)
pocket; the request which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) had made to Alice, that Alice might be
induced to guard her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) from this danger; the words which her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) husband
had spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in the morning, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) anger against him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in that
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had subjected her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to the eyes of a Mrs. Marsham; her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) own unsettled
mind--quite unsettled whether it would be best for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) to go or to
stay! It all came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) now at the first word of tenderness which
Burgo spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>).

<p/>It has often been said of woman that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) who doubts is lost,--so
often that they who say it now, say it simply because others have
said it before them, never thinking whether or no there be any truth
in the proverb. But they who have said so, thinking of their words as
they were uttered, have known but little of women. Women doubt every
day, who solve their doubts at last on the right side, driven to
do so, some by fear, more by conscience, but most of them by that
half-prudential, half-unconscious knowledge of what is fitting,
useful, and best under the cirumstances, which rarely deserts
either men or women till they have brought themselves to the Burgo
Fitzgerald state of recklessness. Men when they have fallen even to
that, will still keep up some outward show towards the world; but
women in this condition defy the world, and declare themselves to be
children of perdition. Lady Glencora was doubting sorely; but, though
doubting, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was not as yet lost.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does it put you in mind of old days?''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was driven to answer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) knew that much would be decided by
the way in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) might now speak. <div class="bookquote">``You must not talk of that,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said, very softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I not?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And now his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) tongue was unloosed, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) began to
speak quickly. <div class="bookquote">``May I not? And why not? They were happy days,--so
happy! Were not you happy when you thought--? Ah, dear! I suppose it
is best not even to think of them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much the best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only it is impossible. I wish I knew the inside of your heart, Cora,
so that I could see what it is that you really wish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In the old days he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had always called her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) Cora, and now the name
came from his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) lips upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) ears as a thing of custom, causing no
surprise. They were standing back, behind the circle, almost in a
corner, and Burgo knew well how to speak at such moments so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
words should be audible to none but her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) addressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should not have come to me at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why not? Who has a better right to come to you? Who has ever
loved you as I have done? Cora, did you get my letter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and dance,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I see a pair of eyes looking at us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The pair of eyes which Lady Glencora saw were in the possession of
Mr. Bott, who was standing alone, leaning against the side of the
doorway, every now and then raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) heels from the ground, so
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) might look down upon the sinners as from a vantage ground.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) was quite alone. Mrs. Marsham had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>), and had gotten herself
away in Lady Glencora's own carriage to Park Lane, in order that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
might find Mr. Palliser there, if by chance he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) should be at home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't it be making mischief?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marsham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Marsham had said when Mr. Bott had
suggested this line of conduct.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There'll be worse mischief if you don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bott had answered. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>)
can come back, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) can do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) likes. I'll keep my eyes upon
them.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) did keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) eyes upon them.

<p/>Again they went round the room,--or that small portion of the room
which the invading crowd had left to the dancers,--as though they
were enjoying themselves thoroughly, and in all innocence. But there
were others besides Mr. Bott who looked on and wondered. The Duchess
of St. Bungay saw it, and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) head sorrowing,--for the Duchess
was good at heart. Mrs. Conway Sparkes saw it, and drank it down with
keen appetite,--as a thirsty man with a longing for wine will drink
champagne,--for Mrs. Conway Sparkes was not good at heart. Lady
Hartletop saw it, and just raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartletop</b></font>) eyebrows. It was nothing to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartletop</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hartletop</b></font>) liked to know what was going on, as such knowledge was
sometimes useful; but, as for heart,--what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartletop</b></font>) had was, in such a
matter, neither good nor bad. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartletop</b></font>) blood circulated with its ordinary
precision, and, in that respect, no woman ever had a better heart.
Lady Monk saw it, and a frown gathered on her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) brow. <div class="bookquote">``The fool!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>)
said to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) knew that Burgo would not help his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) success by
drawing down the eyes of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) guests upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) attempt. In the
meantime Mr. Bott stood there, mounting still higher on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) toes,
straightening his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) back against the wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you get my letter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>Burgo said again, as soon as a moment's
pause gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) breath to speak. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) did not answer him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>). Perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>)
breath did not return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) as rapidly as his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>). But, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) had received it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) would have quickly signified to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) that no letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) hands had it not reached
her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Let us go out upon the stairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``for I must speak to
you. Oh, if you could know what I suffered when you did not come to
Monkshade! Why did you not come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I had not come here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you have seen me? That, at any rate, is not kind of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were now making their way slowly down the stairs, in the crowd,
towards the supper-room. All the world was now intent on food and
drink, and they were only doing as others did. Lady Glencora was not
thinking where she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) went, but, glancing upwards, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) stood for a
moment wedged upon the stairs, her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) eyes met those of Mr. Bott. <div class="bookquote">``A man
that can treat me like that deserves that I should leave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>That
was the thought that crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) mind at the moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll get you some champagne with water in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo. <div class="bookquote">``I know
that is what you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not get me anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said. They had now got into the
room, and had therefore escaped Mr. Bott's eyes for the moment. <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Fitzgerald,'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--and now her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) words had become a whisper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) ear,--<div class="bookquote">``do
what I ask you. For the sake of the old days of which you spoke, the
dear old days which can never come again--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By G--! they can,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``They can come back, and they shall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never. But you can still do me a kindness. Go away, and leave me.
Go to the sideboard, and then do not come back. You are doing me an
injury while you remain with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cora,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) said,

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had now recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) presence of mind, and understood what
was going on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was no longer in a dream, but words and things
bore to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) again their proper meaning. <div class="bookquote">``I will not have it, Mr.
Fitzgerald,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) answered, speaking almost passionately. <div class="bookquote">``I will not
have it. Do as I bid you. Go and leave me, and do not return. I tell
you that we are watched.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>This was still true, for Mr. Bott had now
again got his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) eyes on them, round the supper-room door. Whatever was
the reward for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) was working, private secretaryship or what
else, it must be owned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) worked hard for it. But there are
labours which are labours of love.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is watching us?''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo; <div class="bookquote">``and what does it matter? If you
are minded to do as I have asked you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am not so minded. Do you not know that you insult me by
proposing it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--it is an insult, Cora,--unless such an offer be a joy to you.
If you wish to be my wife instead of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>), it is no insult.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I be that?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) face was not turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) words
were half-pronounced, and in the lowest whisper, but, nevertheless,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) heard them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come with me,--abroad, and you shall yet be my wife. You got my
letter? Do what I asked you, then. Come with me--to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The pressing instance of the suggestion, the fixing of a present
hour, startled her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) propriety. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Fitzgerald,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``I asked you to go and leave me. If you do not do so, I must get up
and leave you. It will be much more difficult.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is that to be all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All;--at any rate, now.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Oh, Glencora! how could you be so weak? Why
did you add that word, <div class="bookquote">``now'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>? In truth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) added it then, at that
moment, simply feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could thus best secure an immediate
compliance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) request.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) said, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) sternly, and leaning before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), with earnest face, with utter indifference as to the eyes of any
that might see them. <div class="bookquote">``I will not go till you tell me that you will
see me again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said in that low, all-but-unuttered whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When,--when,--when?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) asked.

<p/>Looking up again towards the doorway, in fear of Mr. Bott's eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
saw the face of Mr. Palliser as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) entered the room. Mr. Bott had also
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>), and had tried to clutch him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) by the arm; but Mr. Palliser
had shaken him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) off, apparently with indifference,--had got rid of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), as it were, without noticing him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). Lady Glencora, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband, immediately recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) courage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would not cower
before him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), or show herself ashamed of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had done. For the
matter of that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) on the subject, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could bring
herself to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) loved Burgo Fitzgerald much more easily
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could whisper such a word to Burgo himself. Mr. Bott's eyes
were odious to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) as they watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>); but her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband's glance
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could meet without quailing before it. <div class="bookquote">``Here is Mr. Palliser,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), speaking again in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) ordinary clear-toned voice. Burgo
immediately rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) seat with a start, and turned quickly
towards the door; but Lady Glencora kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) chair.

<p/>Mr. Palliser made his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) way as best he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could through the crowd up to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), too, kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) countenance without betraying his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) secret.
There was neither anger nor dismay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) face, nor was there any
untoward hurry in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) movement. Burgo stood aside as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) came up, and
Lady Glencora was the first to speak. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you were gone home
hours ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did go home,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``but I thought I might as well come
back for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a model of a husband! Well; I am ready. Only, what shall we do
about Jane? Mr. Fitzgerald, I left a scarf in your aunt's room,--a
little black and yellow scarf,--would you mind getting it for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will fetch it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser; <div class="bookquote">``and I will tell your cousin
that the carriage shall come back for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will allow me--''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser; and away he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) went, making his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) slow
progress up through the crowd, ordering his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) carriage as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) passed
through the hall, and leaving Mr. Bott still watching at the door.

<p/>Lady Glencora resolved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would say nothing to Burgo while her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
husband was gone. There was a touch of chivalry in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) leaving them
again together, which so far conquered her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might have bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
leave the scarf, and come at once. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had seen, moreover, that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
had not spoken to Mr. Bott, and was thankful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) also for that.
Burgo also seemed to have become aware that his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) chance for that
time was over. <div class="bookquote">``I will say good-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Good-night, Mr.
Fitzgerald,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) answered, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) pressed it for a
moment, and then turned and went. When Mr. Palliser came back he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was
no more to be seen.

<p/>Lady Glencora was at the dining-room door when her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband returned,
standing close to Mr. Bott. Mr. Bott had spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) made
no reply. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) spoke again, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) face remained as immovable as though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had been deaf. <div class="bookquote">``And what shall we do about Mrs. Marsham?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
said, quite out loud, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband's
arm. <div class="bookquote">``I had forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Marsham has gone home,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When did you see her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) came to Park Lane.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What made her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) do that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>These questions were asked and answered as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) into
the carriage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) got in just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) asked the last, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
took his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) seat, did not find it necessary to answer it. But that would
not serve her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) turn. <div class="bookquote">``What made Mrs. Marsham go to you at Park Lane
after she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) left Lady Monk's?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) asked again. Mr. Palliser sat silent,
not having made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) mind what he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would say on the subject. <div class="bookquote">``I
suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) went,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>continued Lady Glencora, <div class="bookquote">``to tell you that I was
dancing with Mr. Fitzgerald. Was that it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, Glencora, we had better not discuss it now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean to discuss it now, or ever. If you did not wish me
to see Mr. Fitzgerald you should not have sent me to Lady Monk's.
But, Plantagenet, I hope you will forgive me if I say that no
consideration shall induce me to receive again as a guest, in my own
house, either Mrs. Marsham or Mr. Bott.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Palliser absolutely declined to say anything on the subject on
that occasion, and the evening of Lady Monk's party in this way came
to an end.




<p/>CHAPTER LI.

<p/>Bold Speculations on Murder.


<p/>George Vavasor was not in a very happy mood when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) left Queen Anne
Street, after having flung his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) gift ring under the grate. Indeed
there was much in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) condition, as connected with the house which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was leaving, which could not but make him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) unhappy. Alice was
engaged to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) wife, and had as yet said nothing to show that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
meditated any breach of that engagement, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) in
a way which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) long to throw her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) promise in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) teeth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was
a man to whom any personal slight from a woman was unendurable. To
slights from men, unless they were of a nature to provoke offence,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was indifferent. There was no man living for whose liking or
disliking George Vavasor cared anything. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) did care much for the
good opinion, or rather for the personal favour, of any woman to whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had endeavoured to make himself agreeable. <div class="bookquote">``I will marry you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>),--not in words, but in acts and looks, which
were plainer than words,--<div class="bookquote">``I will marry you for certain reasons of my
own, which in my present condition make it seem that that arrangement
will be more convenient to me than any other that I can make; but
pray understand that there is no love mixed up with this. There is
another man whom I love;--only, for those reasons above hinted, I
do not care to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>It was thus that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) read Alice's present
treatment of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was a man who could not endure this
treatment with ease.

<p/>But though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) could throw his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) ring under the grate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) passion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
could not so dispose of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). That he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would have done so had his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) hands
been free, we need not doubt. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would have been clever enough
to do so in some manner that would have been exquisitely painful to
Alice, willing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might be to be released from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) engagement.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) could not do this to a woman whose money he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had borrowed, and
whose money he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) could not repay;--to a woman, more of whose money he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
intended to borrow immediately. As to that latter part of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) did
say to himself over and over again, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would have no more of
it. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) left the house in Queen Anne Street, on that occasion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
swore, that under no circumstances would he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) be indebted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) for
another shilling. But before he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had reached Great Marlborough Street,
to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) steps took him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had reminded himself that everything
depended on a further advance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was in Parliament, but Parliament
would be dissolved within three months. Having sacrificed so much
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) position, should he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) let it all fall from him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) now,--now, when
success seemed to be within his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) reach? That wretched old man in
Westmoreland, who seemed gifted almost with immortality,--why could
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) not die and surrender his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) paltry acres to one who could use them?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) turned away from Regent Street into Hanover Square before he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
crossed to Great Marlborough Street, giving vent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) passion
rather than arranging his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) thoughts. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) walked the four sides of
the square he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) considered how good it would be if some accident should
befall the old man. How he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would rejoice were he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to hear to-morrow
that one of the trees of the <div class="bookquote">``accursed place,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>had fallen on the
<div class="bookquote">``obstinate old idiot,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and put an end to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! I will not say that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
meditated the murder of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grandfather. There was a firm conviction
on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought of all this, that such a deed as that
would never come in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told himself, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chose
to make the attempt, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would certainly be able to carry it through
without detection. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembered Rush and Palmer--the openly
bold murderer and the secret poisoner. Both of them, in Vavasor's
estimation, were great men. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had often said so in company. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
declared that the courage of Rush had never been surpassed. <div class="bookquote">``Think of
him (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would say with admiration, <div class="bookquote">``walking into a man's house, with
pistols sufficient to shoot every one there, and doing it as though
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were killing rats! What was Nelson at Trafalgar to that? Nelson
had nothing to fear!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And of Palmer he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) was a man
of genius as well as courage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``looked the whole thing in the
face,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Vavasor would say, <div class="bookquote">``and told himself that all scruples and
squeamishness are bosh,--child's tales. And so they are. Who lives
as though they fear either heaven or hell? And if we do live without
such fear or respect, what is the use of telling lies to ourselves?
To throw it all to the dogs, as Palmer did, is more manly.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And
be hanged,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>some hearer of George's doctrine replied. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, and be
hanged,--if such is your destiny. But you hear of the one who is
hanged, but hear nothing of the twenty who are not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Vavasor walked round Hanover Square, nursing his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hatred against the
old Squire. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did not tell himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would like to murder his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
grandfather. But he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) suggested to himself, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) desired to do
so, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would have courage enough to make his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) way into the old man's
room, and strangle him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) explained to himself how he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would be
able to get down into Westmoreland without the world knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
had been there,--how he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would find an entrance into the house by a
window with which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was acquainted,--how he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could cause the man to
die as though, those around him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) should think, it was apoplexy,--he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>),
George Vavasor, having read something on that subject lately. All
this he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) considered very fully, walking rapidly round Hanover Square
more than once or twice. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) were to become an active student in
the Rush or Palmer school, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) would so study the matter that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) would
not be the one that should be hung. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) could, so far,
trust his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) own ingenuity. But yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) did not meditate murder. <div class="bookquote">``Beastly
old idiot!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) must have his (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) chance as other
men have, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) went across Regent Street to Mr.
Scruby's office in Great Marlborough Street, not having, as yet, come
to any positive conclusion as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) would do in reference to
Alice's money.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) soon found himself talking to Mr. Scruby as though there were
no doubts as to the forthcoming funds for the next elections. And
Mr. Scruby talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) very plainly, as though those funds must
be forthcoming before long. <div class="bookquote">``A stitch in time saves nine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Scruby, meaning to insinuate that a pound in time might have the
same effect. <div class="bookquote">``And I'll tell you what, Mr. Vavasor,--of course I've my
outstanding bills for the last affair. That's no fault of yours, for
the things came so sharp one on another that my fellows haven't had
time to make it out. But if you'll put me in funds for what I must be
out of pocket in June--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will it be so soon as June?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are talking of June. Why, then, I'll lump the two bills
together when it's all over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div><p/>In their discussion respecting money Mr. Scruby injudiciously
mentioned the name of Mr. Tombe. No precise caution had been given
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) had become aware that the matter was being managed
through an agency that was not recognized by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) client; and as that
agency was simply a vehicle of money which found its way into Mr.
Scruby's pocket, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) should have held his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) tongue. But Mr. Tombe's name
escaped from him (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>), and Vavasor immediately questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>). Scruby, who
did not often make such blunders, readily excused himself, shaking
his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) head, and declaring that the name had fallen from his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) lips
instead of that of another man. Vavasor accepted the excuse without
further notice, and nothing more was said about Mr. Tombe while he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>)
was in Mr. Scruby's office. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) had not heard the name in vain,
and had unfortunately heard it before. Mr. Tombe was a remarkable
man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) wore powder to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) hair,--was very polite in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>)
bearing,--was somewhat asthmatic, and wheezed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) talking,--and
was, moreover, the most obedient of men, though it was said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>)
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) managed the whole income of the Ely Chapter just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>)
pleased. Being in these ways a man of note, John Grey had spoken of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) to Alice, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) name had filtered through Alice and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin
Kate to George Vavasor. George seldom forgot things or names, and
when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) heard Mr. Tombe's name mentioned in connection with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) own
money matters, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) remembered that Mr. Tombe was John Grey's lawyer.

<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) could escape out into the street he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) endeavoured to put
all these things together, and after a while resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) would
go to Mr. Tombe. What if there should be an understanding between John
Grey and Alice, and Mr. Tombe should be arranging his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) money matters
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>)! Would not anything be better than this,--even that little
tragedy down in Westmoreland, for which his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) ingenuity and courage
would be required? He (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) could endure to borrow money from Alice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>)
might even endure it still,--though that was very difficult after
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) treatment of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) could not endure to be the recipient of
John Grey's money. By heavens, no! And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) got into a cab, and had
himself driven off to the neighbourhood of Doctors' Commons, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) gave
himself credit for much fine manly feeling. Mr. Tombe's chambers were
found without difficulty, and, as it happened, Mr. Tombe was there.

<p/>The lawyer rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) chair as Vavasor entered, and bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>)
powdered head very meekly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) visitor to sit down. <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Vavasor;--oh, yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had heard the name. Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was in the habit of
acting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) very old friend Mr. John Grey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had acted for Mr. John
Grey, and for Mr. John Grey's father,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) or his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) partner,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) believed
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) might say, for about half a century. There could not be a nicer
gentleman than Mr. John Grey;--and such a pretty child as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) used to
be!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tombe</b></font>)</div>At every new sentence Mr. Tombe caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) poor asthmatic breath,
and bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) meek old head, and rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) hands together as though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) hardly dared to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) seat in Vavasor's presence without the
support of some such motion; and wheezed apologetically, and seemed
to ask pardon of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) visitor for not knowing intuitively what was the
nature of that visitor's business. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) was a sly old fox was Mr.
Tombe, and was considering all this time how much it would be well
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) should tell Mr. Vavasor, and how much it would be well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
should conceal. <div class="bookquote">``The fat had got into the fire,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) old
wife when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) got home that evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) old wife everything,
and I don't know that any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) clients were the worse for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) doing
so. But while he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was wheezing, and coughing, and apologizing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) made
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) mind that if George Vavasor were to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) certain questions,
it would be best that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) should answer them truly. If Vavasor did ask
those questions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would probably do so upon certain knowledge, and
if so, why, in that case, lying would be of no use. Lying would not
put the fat back into the frying pan. And even though such questions
might be asked without any absolute knowledge, they would, at any
rate, show that the questioner had the means of ascertaining the
truth. He (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) would tell as little as he (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) could; but he (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) decided during his (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>)
last wheeze, that he (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) could not lie in the matter with any chance of
benefiting his (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) client. <div class="bookquote">``The prettiest child I ever saw, Mr. Vavasor!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tombe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tombe, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) coughed violently. Some people who knew
Mr. Tombe declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) nursed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) cough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed,--ugh--ugh--ugh.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you tell me, Mr. Tombe, whether either you or he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) have anything to
do with the payment of certain sums to my credit at Messrs. Hock and
Block's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Messrs. Hock and Block's, the bankers,--in Lom--bard Street?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tombe</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Tombe, taking a little more time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I bank there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor, sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A most respectable house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has any money been paid there to my credit, by you, Mr. Tombe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I ask you why you put the question to me, Mr. Vavasor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't think you may. That is to say, my reason for asking it
can have nothing to do with yours for replying to it. If you have had
no hand in any such payment, there is an end of it, and I need not
take up your time by saying anything more on the subject.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not prepared to go that length, Mr. Vavasor,--not altogether to
go that length,--ugh--ugh--ugh.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, will you tell me what you have done in the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,--upon my word, you've taken me a little by surprise. Let me
see. Pinkle,--Pinkle.''  (<font color='red'><b>Pinkle</b></font>)</div>Pinkle was a clerk who sat in an inner room,
and Mr. Tombe's effort to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) seemed to be most ineffectual. But
Pinkle understood the sound, and came. <div class="bookquote">``Pinkle, didn't we pay some
money into Hock and Block's a few weeks since, to the credit of Mr.
George Vavasor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did we, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Pinkle</b></font>)</div>said Pinkle, who probably knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) employer was
an old fox, and who, perhaps, had caught something of the fox nature
himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think we did. Just look Pinkle;--and, Pinkle,--see the date, and
let me know all about it. It's fine bright weather for this time of
year, Mr. Vavasor; but these easterly winds!--ugh--ugh--ugh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Vavasor found himself sitting for an apparently interminable number
of minutes in Mr. Tombe's dingy chamber, and was coughed at, and
wheezed at, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) begun to be tired of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) position; moreover, when
tired, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) impatience. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you'll let us write you a
line when we have looked into the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tombe</b></font>)</div>suggested Mr. Tombe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd rather know at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor. <div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose it can take
you very long to find out whether you have paid money to my account,
by order of Mr. Grey. At any rate, I must know before I go away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pinkle, Pinkle!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>screamed the old man through his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) coughing; and
again Pinkle came. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Pinkle, was anything of the kind done, or
is my memory deceiving me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tombe</b></font>)</div>Mr. Tombe was, no doubt, lying shamefully,
for, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) remembered all about it; and, indeed, George
Vavasor had learned already quite enough for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) own purposes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was going to look,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pinkle</b></font>)</div>said Pinkle; and Pinkle again went away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry to give your clerk so much trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor, in an
angry voice; <div class="bookquote">``and I think it must be unnecessary. Surely you know
whether Mr. Grey has commissioned you to pay money for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have so many things to do, Mr. Vavasor; and so many clients. We
have, indeed. You see, it isn't only one gentleman's affairs. But I
think there was something done. I do, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is Mr. John Grey's address?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>asked Vavasor, very sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Number 5, Suffolk Street, Pall Mall East,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tombe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tombe. Herein
Mr. Tombe somewhat committed himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) client, Mr. Grey, was, in
fact, in town, but Vavasor had not known or imagined that such was
the case. Had Mr. Tombe given the usual address of Nethercoats, nothing
further would have been demanded from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) on that subject. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>)
had foolishly presumed that the question had been based on special
information as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) client's visit to London, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) had told the
plain truth in a very simple way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Number 5, Suffolk Street,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor, writing down the address.
<div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it will be better that I should go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), as you do not
seem inclined to give me any information.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) hat,
and hardly bowing to Mr. Tombe, left the chambers. Mr. Tombe, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>)
did so, rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) chair, and bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) head meekly down upon the
table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pinkle, Pinkle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tombe</b></font>)</div>wheezed Mr. Tombe. <div class="bookquote">``Never mind; never mind.''  (<font color='red'><b>Pinkle</b></font>)</div>Pinkle
didn't mind; and we may say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) had not minded; for up to that
moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) had taken no steps towards a performance of the order which
had been given him (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER LII.

<p/>What Occurred in Suffolk Street, Pall Mall.


<p/>Mr. Tombe had gained nothing for the cause by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) crafty silence.
George Vavasor felt perfectly certain, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) walked out from the
little street which runs at the back of Doctors' Commons, that the
money which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had been using had come, in some shape, through the
hands of John Grey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) did not care much to calculate whether the
payments had been made from the personal funds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) rival, or
whether that rival had been employed to dispense Alice's fortune.
Under either view of the case his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) position was sufficiently bitter.
The truth never for a moment occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) never dreamed that
there might be a conspiracy in the matter, of which Alice was as
ignorant as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) himself had been. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) never reflected that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) uncle
John, together with John, the lover, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) so hated, might be the
conspirators. To him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) it seemed to be certain that Alice and Mr. Grey
were in league;--and if they were in league, what must he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) think of
Alice, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) engagement with himself!

<p/>There are men who rarely think well of women,--who hardly think
well of any woman. They put their mothers and sisters into the
background,--as though they belonged to some sex or race apart,--and
then declare to themselves and to their friends that all women are
false,--that no woman can be trusted unless her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ugliness protect
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and that every woman may be attacked as fairly as may game in
a cover, or deer on a mountain, What man does not know men who have
so thought? I cannot say that such had been Vavasor's creed,--not
entirely such. There had been periods of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
believed implicitly in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cousin Alice;--but then there had been
other moments in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had ridiculed himself for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Quixotism
in believing in any woman. And as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had grown older the moments of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Quixotism had become more rare. There would have been no such
Quixotism left with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now, had not the various circumstances which
I have attempted to describe, filled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), during the last twelve
months, with a renewed desire to marry his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cousin. Every man tries to
believe in the honesty of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) future wife; and, therefore, Vavasor
had tried, and had in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way, believed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had flattered himself,
too, that Alice's heart had, in truth, been more prone to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) than to
that other suitor. Grey, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) thought, had been accepted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cold
prudence; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) thought, also, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) prudence to
be too cold, and had therefore returned where she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had truly loved.
Vavasor, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) did not love much himself, was willing enough to
be the object of love.

<p/>This idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), however, had been greatly shaken by Alice's
treatment of himself personally; but still he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had not, hitherto,
believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was false to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). Now, what could he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) believe of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)? What was there within the compass of such a one to believe?
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) walked out into St. Paul's Churchyard he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) by every
name which is most offensive to a woman's ears. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) at this
moment with even a more bitter hatred than that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) felt towards
John Grey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) must have deceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) with unparalleled hypocrisy,
and lied to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) sister Kate as hardly any woman had ever
lied before. Or could it be that Kate, also, was lying to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)? If so,
Kate also should be included in the punishment.

<p/>But why should they have conspired to feed him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) with these moneys?
There had been no deceit, at any rate, in reference to the pounds
sterling which Scruby had already swallowed. They had been supplied,
whatever had been the motives of the suppliers; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) had no doubt
that more would be supplied if he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) would only keep himself quiet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>)
was still walking westward as he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) thought of this, down Ludgate Hill,
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) direct line towards Suffolk Street; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) tried to persuade
himself that it would be well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) should hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) wrath till
after provision should have been made for this other election. They
were his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) enemies,--Alice and Mr. Grey,--and why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) keep any
terms with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) enemies? It was still a trouble to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) to think
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) should have been in any way beholden to John Grey; but the
terrible thing had been done, the evil had occurred. What would he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
gain by staying his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) hand now? Still, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) walked on quickly
along Fleet Street, and along the Strand, and was already crossing
under the Picture Galleries towards Pall Mall East before he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had
definitely decided what steps he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would take on this very day. Exactly
at the corner of Suffolk Street he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) met John Grey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Grey,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) said, stopping himself suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``I was this moment
going to call on you at your lodgings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At my lodgings, were you? Shall I return with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor, leading the way up Suffolk Street.
There had been no other greeting than this between them. Mr. Grey
himself, though a man very courteous in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) general demeanour, would
probably have passed Vavasor in the street with no more than the
barest salutation. Situated as they were towards each other there
could hardly be any show of friendship between them; but when Vavasor
had spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had dressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) face in that guise of civility
which men always use who do not intend to be offensive;--but Vavasor
dressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) as men dress theirs who do mean to be offensive; and Mr.
Grey had thoroughly appreciated the dressing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will allow me, I have the key,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey. Then they both
entered the house, and Vavasor followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) host up-stairs. Mr. Grey,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) went up, felt almost angry with himself in having admitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
enemy into his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) lodgings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was sure that no good could come of it,
and remembered, when it was too late, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) might easily have saved
himself from giving the invitation while he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was still in the street.
There they were, however, together in the sitting-room, and Grey had
nothing to do but to listen. <div class="bookquote">``Will you take a chair, Mr. Vavasor?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor; <div class="bookquote">``I will stand up.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) stood up, holding
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) hat behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) back with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) left hand, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) right leg
forward, and the thumb of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) right hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) waistcoat-pocket. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
looked full into Grey's face, and Grey looked full into his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>); and as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) looked the great cicatrice seemed to open itself and to become
purple with fresh blood stains.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have come here from Mr. Tombe's office in the City,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor,
<div class="bookquote">``to ask you of what nature has been the interference which you have
taken in my money matters?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a question which Mr. Grey could not answer very quickly. In
the first place it was altogether unexpected; in the next place he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
did not know what Mr. Tombe had told, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) had not told; and
then, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) replied, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) must think how much of the truth he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) was
bound to tell in answer to a question so put to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you say that you have come from Mr. Tombe?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you heard me say so. I have come here direct from Mr. Tombe's
chambers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) is your lawyer, I believe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) is so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I have come from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) to ask you what interference you have
lately taken in my money matters. When you have answered that, I
shall have other questions to ask you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Mr. Vavasor, has it occurred to you that I may not be disposed
to answer questions so asked?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has not occurred to me to think that you will prevaricate. If
there has been no such interference, I will ask your pardon, and go
away; but if there has been such interference on your part, I have a
right to demand that you shall explain to me its nature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div><p/>Grey had now made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) mind that it would be better that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) should
tell the whole story,--better not only for himself, but for all the
Vavasors, including this angry man himself. The angry man evidently
knew something, and it would be better that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should know the truth.
<div class="bookquote">``There has been such interference, Mr. Vavasor, if you choose to call
it so. Money, to the extent of two thousand pounds, I think, has by
my directions been paid to your credit by Mr. Tombe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right hand away from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waistcoat,
and tapping the round table with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fingers impatiently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hardly know how to explain all the circumstances under which this
has been done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say not; but, nevertheless, you must explain them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div><p/>Grey was a man tranquil in temperament, very little prone to
quarrelling, with perhaps an exaggerated idea of the evil results
of a row,--a man who would take infinite trouble to avoid any such
scene as that which now seemed to be imminent; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a man whose
courage was quite as high as that of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opponent. To bully or be
bullied were alike contrary to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nature. It was clear enough now
that Vavasor intended to bully him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind at once
that if the quarrel were forced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) it should find him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ready
to take his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own part. <div class="bookquote">``My difficulty in explaining it comes from
consideration for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I beg that your difficulty will cease, and that you will have
no consideration for me. We are so circumstanced towards each other
that any consideration must be humbug and nonsense. At any rate, I
intend to have none for you. Now, let me know why you have meddled
with my matters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I might, perhaps, better refer you to your uncle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir; Mr. Tombe is not my uncle's lawyer. My uncle never heard his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
name, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) heard of it from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it was by agreement with your uncle that I commissioned Mr. Tombe
to raise for you the money you were desirous of borrowing from your
cousin. We thought it better that her (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) fortune should not be for the
moment disturbed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what had you to do with it? Why should you have done it? In the
first place, I don't believe your story; it is altogether improbable.
But why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) come to you of all men to raise money on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>)
daughter's behalf?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unless you can behave yourself with more discretion, Mr. Vavasor, you
must leave the room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grey. Then, as Vavasor simply sneered
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), but spoke nothing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``It was I who suggested to
your uncle that this arrangement should be made. I did not wish to
see Miss Vavasor's fortune squandered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what was her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) fortune to you, sir? Are you aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is
engaged to me as my wife? I ask you, sir, whether you are aware that
Miss Vavasor is to be my wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must altogether decline to discuss with you Miss Vavasor's present
or future position.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By heavens, then, you shall hear me discuss it! She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was engaged to
you, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has given you your dismissal. If you had understood
anything of the conduct which is usual among gentlemen, or if you
had had any particle of pride in you, sir, you would have left her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
and never mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) name again. I now find you meddling with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
money matters, so as to get a hold upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fortune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no hold upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fortune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, you have. You do not advance two thousand pounds without
knowing that you have security. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has rejected you; and in order
that you may be revenged, or that you may have some further hold
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),--that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) may be in some sort within your power, you have
contrived this rascally pettifogging way of obtaining power over her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
income. The money shall be repaid at once, with any interest that can
be due; and if I find you interfering again, I will expose you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Vavasor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey very slowly, in a low tone of voice, but with
something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) eye which would have told any bystander that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was
much in earnest, <div class="bookquote">``you have used words in your anger which I cannot
allow to pass. You must recall them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What were the words? I said that you were a pettifogging rascal. I
now repeat them.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) spoke he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) hat, so as to leave both
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) hands ready for action if action should be required.

<p/>Grey was much the larger man and much the stronger. It may be doubted
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) knew himself the extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) own strength, but such as
it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) must now use it. <div class="bookquote">``There is no help for
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) also prepared for action. The first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) did
was to open the door, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) did so he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) became conscious that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
mouth was full of blood from a sharp blow upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) face. Vavasor
had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) fist, and had cut his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) lip against his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) teeth.
Then there came a scramble, and Grey was soon aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
opponent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) hands. I doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had attempted to strike a
blow, or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had so much as clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) fist. Vavasor had
struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) repeatedly, but the blows had fallen on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) body or his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
head, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was unconscious of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had but one object now in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) mind, and that object was the kicking his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) assailant down the
stairs. Then came a scramble, as I have said, and Grey had a hold of
the smaller man by the nape of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) neck. So holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) forced
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) back through the door on to the landing, and there succeeded in
pushing him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) down the first flight of steps. Grey kicked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) went, but the kick was impotent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had, however, been so far
successful that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) enemy out of the room, and had the
satisfaction of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) sprawling on the landing-place.

<p/>Vavasor, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) raised himself, prepared to make another rush at
the room, but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) could do so a man from below, hearing the
noise, had come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) and interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jones,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey,
speaking from above, <div class="bookquote">``if that gentleman does not leave the house, I
must get you to search for a policeman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div><p/>Vavasor, though the lodging-house man had hold of the collar of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
coat, made no attempt to turn upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) new enemy. When two dogs are
fighting, any bystander may attempt to separate them with impunity.
The brutes are so anxious to tear each other that they have no
energies left for other purposes. It never occurs to them to turn
their teeth upon newcomers in the quarrel. So it was with George
Vavasor. Jones was sufficient to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) further attack upon the
foe up-stairs, and therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) had no alternative but to relinquish
the fight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's it all about, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Calder Jones/Jones</b></font>)</div>said Jones, who kept a tailor's
establishment, and, as a tailor, was something of a fighting man
himself. Of all tradesmen in London the tailors are, no doubt, the
most combative,--as might be expected from the necessity which lies
upon them of living down the general bad character in this respect
which the world has wrongly given them. <div class="bookquote">``What's it all about, sir?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Calder Jones/Jones</b></font>)</div>said Jones, still holding Vavasor by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) coat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That man has ill-used me, and I've punished him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know much about punishing,''  (<font color='red'><b>the tailor</b></font>)</div>said the tailor. <div class="bookquote">``It seems to me
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pitched you down pretty clean out of the room above. I think the
best thing you can do now is to walk yourself off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the only thing that Vavasor could do, and he (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) did walk himself
off. He (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) walked himself off, and went home to his (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) own lodgings in
Cecil Street, that he (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) might smooth his (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) feathers after the late
encounter before he (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) went down to Westminster to take his (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) seat in the
House of Commons. I do not think that he (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) was comfortable when he (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) got
there, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) felt himself very well able to fight another battle
that night on behalf of the River Bank. He (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) had not been hurt, but he (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>)
had been worsted. Grey had probably received more personal damage
than had fallen to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) share; but Grey had succeeded in expelling him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
from the room, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had been found prostrate on the
landing-place when the tailor first saw him (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>).

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) might probably have got over the annoyance of this feeling
had he (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) not been overwhelmed by a consciousness that everything was
going badly with him (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) was already beginning to hate his (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) seat in
Parliament. What good had it done for him (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>), or was it likely to do
for him (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) found himself to be associated there with Mr. Bott, and
a few others of the same class,--men whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) despised; and even they
did not admit him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) among them without a certain show of superiority
on their part. Who has not ascertained by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) own experience the
different lights through which the same events may be seen, according
to the success, or want of success, which pervades the atmosphere
at the moment? At the present time everything was unsuccessful with
George Vavasor; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) told himself, almost from hour to hour,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would go on with the thing which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had begun,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would
persevere in Parliament till he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had obtained a hearing there and
created for himself success, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) could not himself believe in the
promises which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had made to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had looked forward to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
entrance into that Chamber as the hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) triumph; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had
entered it with Mr. Bott, and there had been no triumph to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) in
doing so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) had sworn to himself that when there he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) would find men
to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>). Hitherto, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) could not accuse himself of having
missed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) opportunities; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) election had been so recent that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>)
could hardly yet have made the attempt. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) had been there long
enough to learn to fancy that there was no glory in attempting. This
art of speaking in Parliament, which had appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) to be so
grand, seemed already to be a humdrum, homely, dull affair. No one
seemed to listen much to what was said. To such as himself,--Members
without an acquired name,--men did not seem to listen at all. Mr.
Palliser had once, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hearing, spoken for two hours together, and
all the House had treated his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) speech with respect,--had declared that
it was useful, solid, conscientious, and what not; but more than half
the House had been asleep more than half the time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
legs. Vavasor had not as yet commenced his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) career as an orator; but
night after night, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) sat there, the chance of commencing it with
brilliance seemed to be further from him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), and still further. Two
thousand pounds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) own money, and two thousand more of Alice's
money,--or of Mr. Grey's,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had already spent to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) way into
that assembly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) must spend, at any rate, two thousand more if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
intended that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) career should be prolonged beyond a three months'
sitting;--and how was he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) to get this further sum after what had taken
place to-day?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would get it. That was his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) resolve as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) walked in by the
apple-woman's stall, under the shadow of the great policeman, and
between the two august lamps. He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) would get it;--as long as Alice had
a pound over which he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) could obtain mastery by any act or violence
within his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) compass. He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) would get it; even though it should come
through the hands of John Grey and Mr. Tombe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) would get it; though
in doing so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) might destroy his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) cousin Alice and ruin his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) sister
Kate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) had gone too far to stick at any scruples. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) not often
declared how great had been that murderer who had been able to divest
himself of all such scruples,--who had scoured his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) bosom free from
all fears of the hereafter, and, as regarded the present, had dared
to trust for everything to success? He (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) would go to Alice and demand
the money from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) with threats, and with that violence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) eyes
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) knew so well how to assume. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) believed that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) so
demanded it, the money would be forthcoming so as to satisfy, at any
rate, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) present emergencies.

<p/>That wretched old man in Westmoreland! If he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) would but die, there
might yet be a hope remaining of permanent success! Even though
the estate might be entailed so as to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) no more than a
life-interest, still money might be raised on it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) life-interest
in it would be worth ten or twelve years' purchase. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) had an idea
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) grandfather had not as yet made any such will when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tombe</b></font>) left
the place in Westmoreland. What a boon it would be if death could be
made to overtake the old man before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did so! On this very night he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
walked about the lobbies of the House, thinking of all this. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went
by himself from room to room, roaming along passages, sitting now for
ten minutes in the gallery, and then again for a short space in the
body of the House,--till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would get up and wander again out into
the lobby, impatient of the neighbourhood of Mr. Bott. Certainly just
at this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) felt no desire to bring before the House the subject
of the River Embankment.

<p/>Nor was Mr. Grey much happier when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was left alone, than was his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
assailant. To give Vavasor his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) due, the memory of the affray itself
did not long trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) much. The success between the combatants had
been nearly equal, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had, at any rate, spoken his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) mind freely.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) misery had come from other sources. But the reflection that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
had been concerned in a row was in itself enough to make John Grey
wretched for the time. Such a misfortune had never hitherto befallen
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). In all his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) dealings with men words had been sufficient, and
generally words of courtesy had sufficed. To have been personally
engaged in a fighting scramble with such a man as George Vavasor was
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) terrible. When ordering that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) money might be expended with
the possible object of saving Alice from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had never
felt a moment's regret; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had never thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was doing more
than circumstances fairly demanded of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>). But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was almost
driven to utter reproach. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Alice! that this thing should have
come upon me through thy fault!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>When Vavasor was led away down stairs by the tailor, and Grey found
that no more actual fighting would be required of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) retired
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) bedroom, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) might wash his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) mouth and free himself from
the stains of the combat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had heard the front door closed, and
knew that the miscreant was gone,--the miscreant who had disturbed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) quiet. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) began to think what was the accusation with which
Vavasor had charged him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had been told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had advanced
money on behalf of Alice, in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) might obtain some power
over Alice's fortune, and thus revenge himself upon Alice for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
treatment of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). Nothing could be more damnably false than this
accusation. Of that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was well aware. But were not the circumstances
of a nature to make it appear that the accusation was true? Security
for the money advanced by him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had none;--of course
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had desired none;--of course the money had been given out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
own pocket with the sole object of saving Alice, if that might be
possible; but of all those who might hear of this affair, how many
would know or even guess the truth?

<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was in this wretched state of mind, washing his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) mouth, and
disturbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) spirit, Mr. Jones, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) landlord, came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>). Mr.
Jones had known him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) for some years, and entertained a most profound
respect for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) character. A rather sporting man than otherwise was
Mr. Jones. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) father had been a tradesman at Cambridge, and in this
way Jones had become known to Mr. Grey. But though given to sport,
by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) meant modern prize-fighting and the Epsom course on the
Derby day, Mr. Jones was a man who dearly loved respectable customers
and respectable lodgers. Mr. Grey, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) property at Nethercoats,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) august manners, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) reputation at Cambridge, was a most
respectable lodger, and Mr. Jones could hardly understand how any one
could presume to raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) hand against such a man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear, sir--this is a terrible affair!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)
way into the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was very disagreeable, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was the gentleman known to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the tailor</b></font>)</div>asked the tailor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I know who he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Any quarrel, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes. I should not have pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) down stairs had he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) not
quarrelled with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We can have the police after him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) if you wish it, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't wish it at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or we might manage to polish him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) off in any other way, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div><p/>It was some time before Mr. Grey could get rid of the tailor, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
did so at last without having told any part of the story to that
warlike, worthy, and very anxious individual.




<p/>CHAPTER LIII.

<p/>The Last Will of the Old Squire.


<p/>In the meantime Kate Vavasor was living down in Westmoreland, with no
other society than that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) grandfather, and did not altogether
have a very pleasant life of it. George had been apt to represent the
old man to himself as being as strong as an old tower, which, though
it be but a ruin, shows no sign of falling. To his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eyes the Squire
had always seemed to be full of life and power. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) could be violent
on occasions, and was hardly ever without violence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) eyes and
voice. But George's opinion was formed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wish, or rather by
the reverses of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wish. For years he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had been longing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
grandfather should die,--had been accusing Fate of gross injustice in
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) did not snap the thread; and with such thoughts in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) mind
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had grudged every ounce which the Squire's vigour had been able to
sustain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had almost taught himself to believe that it would be a
good deed to squeeze what remained of life out of that violent old
throat. But, indeed, the embers of life were burning low; and had
George known all the truth, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would hardly have inclined his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mind to
thoughts of murder.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was, indeed, very weak with age, and tottering with unsteady steps
on the brink of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) grave, though he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would still come down early from
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) room, and would, if possible, creep out about the garden and into
the farmyard. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would still sit down to dinner, and would drink his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
allotted portion of port wine, in the doctor's teeth. The doctor by
no means desired to rob him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) last luxury, or even to stint
his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) quantity; but he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) recommended certain changes in the mode and
time of taking it. Against this, however, the old Squire indignantly
rebelled, and scolded Kate almost off her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) legs when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) attempted
to enforce the doctor's orders. <div class="bookquote">``What the mischief does it signify,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the old man said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) one evening;--<div class="bookquote">``what difference will it make
whether I am dead or alive, unless it is that George would turn you
out of the house directly he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) gets it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not thinking of any one but yourself, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, with a
tear in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't be troubled to think of me much longer,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire;
and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) gulped down the remaining half of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) glass of wine.

<p/>Kate was, in truth, very good to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). Women always are good under
such circumstances; and Kate Vavasor was one who would certainly
stick to such duties as now fell to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) lot. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was eminently true
and loyal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) friends, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) could be as false on their
behalf as most false people can be on their own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was very good
to the old man, tending all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) violence with
good-humour rather than with submission, not opposing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with direct
contradiction when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) abused his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grandson, but saying little words
to mitigate his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrath, if it were possible. At such times the Squire
would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) also would learn to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) brother's
character some day. <div class="bookquote">``You'll live to be robbed by him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and turned out
as naked as you were born,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) one day. Then Kate fired
up and declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) fully trusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother's love. Whatever
faults he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might have, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had been staunch to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), So she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said, and
the old man sneered at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) for saying so.

<p/>One morning, soon after this, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bedroom
some mixture of thin porridge, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still endeavoured to swallow
for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breakfast, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) sit down, and began to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
about the property. <div class="bookquote">``I know you are a fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``about all
matters of business;--more of a fool than even women generally are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>To this Kate acceded with a little smile,--acknowledging that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
understanding was limited. <div class="bookquote">``I want to see Gogram,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Do you
write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gogram</b></font>) a line, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Gogram</b></font>) to come here to-day,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Gogram</b></font>) or one of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gogram</b></font>) men,--and send it at once by Peter.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gogram/Gogram</b></font>)</div>Gogram was an attorney who
lived at Penrith, and who was never summoned to Vavasor Hall unless
the Squire had something to say about his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) will. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you think
you'd better put it off till you are a little stronger?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate.
Whereupon the Squire fired at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) such a volley of oaths that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
sprang off the chair on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was sitting, and darted across to a
little table at which there was pen and ink, and wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) note to Mr.
Gogram, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had recovered from the shaking which the battery
had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) wrote the note, and ran away with it to Peter,
and saw Peter on the pony on his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) way to Penrith, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) dared to
return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) grandfather's bedside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What should you do with the estate if I left it you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Squire</b></font>)</div>the Squire
said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) the first moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was again back with him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>).

<p/>This was a question she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) could not answer instantly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) stood by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) bedside for a while thinking,--holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) grandfather's hand
and looking down upon the bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) rough watery old eyes,
was gazing up into her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) face, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) were trying to read her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
thoughts. <div class="bookquote">``I think I should give it to my brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'm d-- if I'll leave it to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) did not jump now, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had sworn at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) still stood,
holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hand softly, and looking down upon the bed. <div class="bookquote">``If I were
you, grandfather,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said almost in a whisper, <div class="bookquote">``I would not trust
myself to alter family arrangements whilst I was ill. I'm sure you
would advise any one else against doing so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if I were to leave it to Alice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'d give it to him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
said, speaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) thoughts out loud. <div class="bookquote">``What it is you see in him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>), I
never could even guess. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)'s as ugly as a baboon, with his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) scarred
face. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) has never done anything to show himself a clever fellow.
Kate, give me some of that bottle the man sent.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>Kate handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
medicine, and then stood again by his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) bedside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) get the money to pay for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) election?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>the Squire
asked, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had swallowed the draught. <div class="bookquote">``They wouldn't give
such a one as him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) credit a yard further than they could see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, lying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has not had yours; has he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not take it, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you offered it to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has not had it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a penny of it, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what made you offer it to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) after what I said to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it was my own,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, stoutly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're the biggest idiot that ever I heard of, and you'll know it
yourself some day. Go away now, and let me know when Gogram comes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) went away, and for a time employed herself about her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) ordinary
household work. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) sat down alone in the dingy old dining-room,
to think what had better be done in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) present circumstances. The
carpet of the room was worn out, as were also the covers of the
old chairs and the horsehair sofa which was never moved from its
accustomed place along the wall. It was not a comfortable Squire's
residence, this old house at Vavasor. In the last twenty years no
money had been spent on furniture or embellishments, and for the last
ten years there had been no painting, either inside or out. Twenty
years ago the Squire had been an embarrassed man, and had taken a
turn in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) life and had lived sparingly. It could not be said that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had become a miser. His (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) table was kept plentifully, and there had
never been want in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) house. In some respects, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had behaved
liberally to Kate and to others, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had kept up the timber and
fences on the property. But the house had become wretched in its
dull, sombre, dirty darkness, and the gardens round it were as bad.

<p/>What ought she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) now to do? She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) believed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) grandfather's last
days were coming, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) knew that others of the family should be
with him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) besides herself. For their sakes, for his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>), and for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) own,
it would be proper that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) should not be alone there when he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) died.
But for whom should she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) send? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother was the natural heir, and
would be the head of the family. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) duty to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was clear, and the
more so as her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) grandfather was at this moment speaking of changes in
his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) will. But it was a question to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) whether George's presence at
Vavasor, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would come, would not at this moment do more harm
than good to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own interests. It would make some prejudicial change
in the old man's will more probable instead of less so. George would
not become soft and mild-spoken even by a death-bed side, and it
would be likely enough that the Squire would curse his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) heir with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
dying breath. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) might send for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) uncle John; but if she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) did so
without telling George she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would be treating George unfairly; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
knew that it was improbable that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) uncle and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother should act
together in anything. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt Greenow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) thought, would come to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) presence would not influence the Squire in any way with
reference to the property. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mind at last that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
would ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt to come to Vavasor, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
brother accurately all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) could tell,--leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to come or
stay, as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might think. Alice would, no doubt, learn all the facts
from him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) uncle John would hear them from Alice. Then they
could do as they pleased. As soon as Mr. Gogram had been there she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
would write her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) letters, and they should be sent over to Shap early
on the following morning.

<p/>Mr. Gogram came and was closeted with the Squire, and the doctor
also came. The doctor saw Kate, and, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) head, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) grandfather was sinking lower and lower every hour. It would be
infinitely better for him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) would take that port wine at four
doses in the day, or even at two, instead of taking it all together.
Kate promised to try again, but stated her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) conviction that the
trial would be useless. The doctor, when pressed on the matter,
said that his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) patient might probably live a week, not improbably a
fortnight,--perhaps a month, if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would be obedient,--and so forth.
Gogram went away without seeing Kate; and Kate, who looked upon a
will as an awful and somewhat tedious ceremony, was in doubt whether
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) grandfather would live to complete any new operation. But, in
truth, the will had been made and signed and witnessed,--the parish
clerk and one of the tenants having been had up into the room as
witnesses. Kate knew that the men had been there, but still did not
think that a new will had been perfected.

<p/>That evening when it was dusk the Squire came into the dining-room,
having been shuffling about the grand sweep before the house for a
quarter of an hour. The day was cold and the wind bleak, but still
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would go out, and Kate had wrapped him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) up carefully in mufflers
and great-coats. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) came in to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) called dinner, and Kate
sat down with him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had drank no wine that day, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had
brought it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) twice during the morning. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) attempted to
swallow a little soup, but failed; and after that, while Kate was
eating her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) bit of chicken, had the decanter put before him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I can't
eat, and I suppose it won't hurt you if I take my wine at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
said. It went against the grain with him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), even yet, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) could not
wait till the cloth was gone from the table, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) impatience for
the only sustenance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) could take was too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you should eat something, sir; will you have a bit of toast to
sop in your wine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The word <div class="bookquote">``sop''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>was badly chosen, and made the old Squire angry.
<div class="bookquote">``Sopped toast! why am I to spoil the only thing I can enjoy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the wine would do you more good if you would take something with
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good! Nothing will do me any good any more. As for eating, you know
I can't eat. What's the use of bothering me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
second glass, and paused awhile before he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) put it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) lips. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
never exceeded four glasses, but the four he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
would have, as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) could lift them to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) mouth.

<p/>Kate finished, or pretended to finish, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) dinner within five
minutes, in order that the table might be made to look comfortable
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) poked the fire, and brushed up the hearth, and
closed the old curtains with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) own hands, moving about silently. As
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) eye followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) came behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) chair,
and pushed the decanter a little more within his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) reach, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) put out
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) rough, hairy hand, and laid it upon one of hers which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had
rested on the table, with a tenderness that was unusual with him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``You are a good girl, Kate. I wish you had been a boy, that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had, I shouldn't, perhaps, have been here to take care of you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; you'd have been like your brother, no doubt. Not that I think
there could have been two so bad as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, grandfather, if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has offended you, you should try to forgive
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Try to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)! How often have I forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) without any
trying? Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) come down here the other day, and insult me for
the last time? Why didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) keep away, as I had bidden him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you gave him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) leave to see you, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't give him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) leave to treat me like that. Never mind; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will
find that, old as I am, I can punish an insult.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't done anything, sir, to injure him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have made another will, that's all. Do you suppose I had that man
here all the way from Penrith for nothing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it isn't done yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you it is done. If I left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the whole property it would be
gone in two years' time. What's the use of doing it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life, sir! You had promised him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have it
for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How dare you tell me that? I never promised him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). As my heir, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would have had it all, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have behaved himself with common
decency. Even though I disliked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as I always have done, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should
have had it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have taken it from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) altogether?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall answer no questions about it, Kate.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Then a fit of coughing
came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) four glasses of wine having been all taken, and
there was no further talk about business. During the evening Kate
read a chapter of the Bible out loud. But the Squire was very
impatient under the reading, and positively refused permission for
a second. <div class="bookquote">``There isn't any good in so much of it, all at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
said, using almost exactly the same words which Kate had used to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
about the port wine. There may have been good produced by the small
quantity to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) listened, as there is good from the physic which
children take with wry faces, most unwillingly. Who can say?

<p/>For many weeks past Kate had begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) uncle to allow the clergyman
of Vavasor to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had positively declined. The vicar
was a young man to whom the living had lately been given by the
Chancellor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) had commenced his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) career by giving instant offence
to the Squire. This vicar's predecessor had been an old man, almost
as old as the Squire himself, and had held the living for forty
years. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had been a Westmoreland man, had read the prayers and
preached his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) one Sunday sermon in a Westmoreland dialect, getting
through the whole operation rather within an hour and a quarter. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had troubled none of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) parishioners by much advice, and had been
meek and obedient to the Squire. Knowing the country well, and being
used to its habits, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had lived, and been charitable too, on the
proceeds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) living, which had never reached two hundred a year.
But the new comer was a close-fisted man, with higher ideas of
personal comfort, who found it necessary to make every penny go as
far as possible, who made up in preaching for what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not
give away in charity; who established an afternoon service, and who
had rebuked the Squire for saying that the doing so was trash and
nonsense. Since that the Squire had never been inside the church,
except on the occasion of Christmas-day. For this, indeed, the state
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) health gave ample excuse; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had positively refused to
see the vicar, though that gentleman had assiduously called, and had
at last desired the servant to tell the clergyman not to come again
unless he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) were sent for. Kate's task was, therefore, difficult, both
as regarded the temporal and spiritual wants of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) grandfather.

<p/>When the reading was finished, the old man dozed in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair for
half an hour. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not go up to bed before the enjoyment of that
luxury. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was daily implored to do so, because that sleep in the
chair interfered so fatally with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chance of sleeping in bed. But
sleep in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would and did. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) woke, and after a fit
of coughing, was induced, with much ill-humour, to go up to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) room.
Kate had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so weak. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was hardly able, even with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
assistance and that of the old servant, to get up the broad stairs.
But there was still some power left to him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) for violence of language
after he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) got to his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) room, and he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) rated Kate and the old woman loudly,
because his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) slippers were not in the proper place. <div class="bookquote">``Grandfather,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, <div class="bookquote">``would you like me to stay in the room with you to-night?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) rated her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) again for this proposition, and then, with assistance
from the nurse, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was gotten into bed and was left alone.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: The last of the old squire.-RSB-


<p/>After that Kate went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) own room and wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) letters. The first
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) wrote was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt Greenow. That was easily enough written. To
Mrs. Greenow it was not necessary that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) should say anything about
money. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) simply stated her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) belief that her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) grandfather's last day
was near at hand, and begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) aunt to come and pay a last visit to
the old man. <div class="bookquote">``It will be a great comfort to me in my distress,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
said; <div class="bookquote">``and it will be a satisfaction to you to have seen your father
again.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) aunt would come, and that task was soon
done.

<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) brother was much more difficult. What should
she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) tell him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and what should she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) began by
describing her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) grandfather's state, and by saying to him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
had done to Mrs. Greenow, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) believed the old man's hours were
well-nigh come to a close. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) aunt
to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``not,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that I think her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) coming will be
of material service, but I feel the loneliness of the house will be
too much for me at such a time. I must leave it for you to decide,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``whether you had better be here. If anything should
happen,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--people when writing such letters are always afraid to speak
of death by its proper name,--<div class="bookquote">``I will send you a message, and no
doubt you would come at once.''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>Then came the question of the will.
Had it not occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) own interests were involved
she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) would have said nothing on the subject; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) feared her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
brother,--feared even his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) misconstruction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) motives, even though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was willing to sacrifice so much on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) behalf,--and therefore
she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) resolved to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) knew. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might turn upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
hereafter if she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) did not do so, and accuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) of a silence which had
been prejudicial to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).

<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) told it all, and the letter became long in the telling. <div class="bookquote">``I
write with a heavy heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``because I know it will be a
great blow to you. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) gave me to understand that in this will he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) left
everything away from you. I cannot declare that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said so directly.
Indeed I cannot remember his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) words; but that was the impression he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
left on me. The day before he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had asked me what I should do if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
gave me the estate; but of course I treated that as a joke. I have no
idea what he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) put into his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will. I have not even attempted to guess.
But now I have told you all that I know.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The letter was a very long
one, and was not finished till late; but when it was completed she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
had the two taken out into the kitchen, as the boy was to start with
them before daylight.

<p/>Early on the next morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) crept silently into her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) grandfather's
room, as was her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) habit; but he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was apparently sleeping, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
crept back again. The old servant told her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) that the Squire had been
awake at four, and at five, and at six, and had called for her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>). Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had seemed to go to sleep. Four or five times in the course of the
morning Kate went into the room, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) grandfather did not notice
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) feared he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) might already have passed away, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
put her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) shoulder, and down his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) arm. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) then gently
touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) hand with his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>), showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) plainly that he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was not
only alive, but conscious. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) then offered him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) food,--the thin
porridge,--which he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was wont to take, and the medicine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) offered
him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) some wine too, but he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) would take nothing.

<p/>At twelve o'clock a letter was brought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), which had come by the
post. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) saw that it was from Alice, and opening it found that it
was very long. At that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not read it, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) saw
words in it that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wish to know its contents as quickly as
possible. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) grandfather then. At two
o'clock the doctor came to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), and remained there till the dusk of
the evening had commenced. At eight o'clock the old man was dead.




<p/>CHAPTER LIV.

<p/>Showing How Alice Was Punished.


<p/>Poor Kate's condition at the old Hall on that night was very sad.
The presence of death is always a source of sorrow, even though the
circumstances of the case are of a kind to create no agony of grief.
The old man who had just passed away up-stairs was fully due to go.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had lived his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) span all out, and had himself known that to die was
the one thing left for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to do. Kate also had expected his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) death,
and had felt that the time had come in which it would be foolish even
to wish that it should be arrested. But death close to one is always
sad as it is solemn.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was quite alone at Vavasor Hall. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had no acquaintance
within some miles of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). From the young vicar, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) herself
had not quarrelled with him (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) could receive no comfort, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
hardly knew him (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>); nor was she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) of a temperament which would dispose her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
to turn to a clergyman at such a time for comfort, unless to one who
might have been an old friend. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt and brother would probably
both come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), but they could hardly be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) for a day or two,
and during that day or two it would be needful that orders should
be given which it is disagreeable for a woman to have to give. The
servants, moreover, in the house were hardly fit to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) much.
There was an old butler, or footman, who had lived at the Hall for
more than fifty years, but he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) was crippled with rheumatism, and so
laden with maladies, that he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) rarely crept out of his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) own room. He (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) was
simply an additional burden on the others. There was a boy who had
lately done all the work which the other should have done, and ever
so much more beside. There is no knowing how much work such a boy
will do when properly drilled, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was now Kate's best minister in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) distress. There was the old nurse,--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had been simply good
for nursing, and there were two rough Westmoreland girls who called
themselves cook and housemaid.

<p/>On that first evening,--the very day on which her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) grandfather had
died,--Kate would have been more comfortable had she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) really found
something that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) could do. But there was in truth nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
hovered for an hour or two in and out of the room, conscious of the
letter which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) pocket, and very desirous in heart of
reading it, but restrained by a feeling that at such a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
ought to think only of the dead. In this she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was wrong. Let the
living think of the dead, when their thoughts will travel that way
whether the thinker wish it or no. Grief taken up because grief is
supposed to be proper, is only one degree better than pretended
grief. When one sees it, one cannot but think of the lady who asked
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) friend, in confidence, whether hot roast fowl and bread-sauce
were compatible with the earliest state of weeds; or of that other
lady,--a royal lady she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),--who was much comforted in the tedium of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
trouble when assured by one of the lords about the Court that piquet
was mourning.

<p/>It was late at night, near eleven, before Kate took out her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) letter
and read it. As something of my story hangs upon it, I will give it
at length, though it was a long letter. It had been written with
great struggles, and with many tears, and Kate, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) read it to the
end, almost forgot that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) grandfather was lying dead in the room
above her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>).


<p/>Queen Anne Street, April, 186--.

<p/>DEAREST KATE,

<p/>I hardly know how to write to you--what I have to tell,
and yet I must tell it. I must tell it to you, but I shall
never repeat the story to any one else. I should have
written yesterday, when it occurred, but I was so ill that
I felt myself unable to make the exertion. Indeed, at one
time, after your brother had left me, I almost doubted
whether I should ever be able to collect my thoughts
again. My dismay was at first so great that my reason for
a time deserted me, and I could only sit and cry like an
idiot.

<p/>Dear Kate, I hope you will not be angry with me for
telling you. I have endeavoured to think about it as
calmly as I can, and I believe that I have no alternative.
The fact that your brother has quarrelled with me cannot
be concealed from you, and I must not leave him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to tell
you of the manner of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) came to me yesterday in great
anger. His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) anger then was nothing to what it became
afterwards; but even when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) first came in he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was full of
wrath. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) stood up before me, and asked me how it had come
to pass that I had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) the money which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had asked
of me through the hands of Mr. Grey. Of course I had not
done this, and so I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) at once. I had spoken of
the matter to no one but papa, and he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) had managed it for
me. Even now I know nothing of it, and as I have not yet
spoken to papa I cannot understand it. George at once told
me that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) disbelieved me, and when I sat quiet under
this insult, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) used harsher words, and said that I had
conspired to lower him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) before the world.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) then asked me whether I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). Oh, Kate, I must
tell it you all, though it is dreadful to me that I should
have to write it. You remember how it came to pass when we
were in Westmoreland together at Christmas? Do not think
that I am blaming you, but I was very rash then in the
answers which I made to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). I thought that I could be
useful to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife, and I had told myself that it
would be good that I should be of use in some way. When
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) asked me that question yesterday, I sat silent. Indeed,
how could I have answered it in the affirmative, when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
had just used such language to me,--while he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was standing
opposite to me, looking at me in that way which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has
when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is enraged? Then he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) spoke again and demanded of me
that I should at once send back to Mr. Grey all presents
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) which I had kept, and at the same time took up and
threw across the table on to the sofa near me, a little
paper knife which Mr. Grey once gave me. I could not allow
myself to be so ordered by him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>); so I said nothing, but put
the knife back upon the table. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) then took it again and
threw it beneath the grate. <div class="bookquote">``I have a right to look upon
you as my wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and, as such, I will not allow
you to keep that man's things about you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I think I told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) then that I should never become his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) wife, but though
I remember many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) words, I remember none of my own.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) swore, I know, with a great oath, that if I went back
a second time from my word to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would leave me no
peace,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would punish me for my perfidy with some
fearful punishment. Oh, Kate, I cannot tell you what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
looked like. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had then come quite close to me, and I
know that I trembled before him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) were going
to strike me. Of course I said nothing. What could I say
to a man who behaved to me in such a manner? Then, as far
as I can remember it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat down and began to talk about
money. I forget what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said at first, but I know that I
assured him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might take what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted so long as
enough was left to prevent my being absolutely a burden
on papa. <div class="bookquote">``That, madam, is a matter of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) said. I
remember those words so well. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) explained that after
what had passed between us, I had no right to ruin him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) by
keeping back from him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) money which had been promised to
him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), and which was essential to his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) success. In this, dear
Kate, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) was mainly right. But he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) could not have
been right in putting it to me in that hard, cruel manner,
especially as I had never refused anything that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) had
asked of me in respect of money. The money he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) may have
while it lasts; but then there must be an end of it all
between us, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) should have the power of
punishing me, as he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) will do. Punishing me, indeed!
What punishment can be so hard as that which he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) has
already inflicted?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) then desired me to write a letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) which he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
might show to the lawyer,--to our own lawyer, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
meant,--in order that money might be raised to pay back
what Mr. Grey had advanced, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) now
required. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) said it was to be five thousand
pounds. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) asked this I did not move. Indeed, I was
unable to move. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) spoke very loud, and swore at me
again, and brought me pen and ink, demanding that I should
write the letter. I was so frightened that I thought of
running to the door to escape, and I would have done so
had I not distrusted my own power. Had it been to save my
life I could not have written the letter. I believe I was
now crying,--at any rate I threw myself back and covered
my face with my hands. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) came and sat by me, and
took hold of my arms. Oh, Kate; I cannot tell it you all.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) mouth close to my ear, and said words which
were terrible, though I did not understand them. I do
not know what it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) said, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was threatening me
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) anger if I did not obey him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) left me,
I believe I found my voice to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) should
certainly have the money which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) required. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
shall. I will go to Mr. Round myself, and insist on its
being done. My money is my own, and I may do with it as
I please. But I hope,--I am obliged to hope, that I may
never be made to see my cousin again.

<p/>I will not pretend to express any opinion as to the cause
of all this. It is very possible that you will not believe
all I say,--that you will think that I am mad and have
deluded myself. Of course your heart will prompt you to
accuse me rather than him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). If it is so, and if there must
therefore be a division between us, my grief will be
greatly increased; but I do not know that I can help it.
I cannot keep all this back from you. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) has cruelly
ill-used me and insulted me. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) has treated me as I
should have thought no man could have treated a woman. As
regards money, I did all that I could do to show that I
trusted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoroughly, and my confidence has only led
to suspicion. I do not know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) understands that
everything must be over between us; but, if not, I must
ask you to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so. And I must ask you to explain to
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must not come again to Queen Anne Street. If
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does, nothing shall induce me to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) also
that the money that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants shall assuredly be sent to
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as soon as I can make Mr. Round get it.

<p/>Dearest Kate, good-bye. I hope you will feel for me.
If you do not answer me I shall presume that you think
yourself bound to support his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) side, and to believe me to
have been wrong. It will make me very unhappy; but I shall
remember that you are his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) sister, and I shall not be angry
with you.

<p/>Yours always affectionately,

<p/>ALICE VAVASOR.


<p/>Kate, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) read her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) letter through, at first quickly, and then
very slowly, came by degrees almost to forget that death was in the
house. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mind, and heart, and brain, were filled with thoughts and
feelings that had exclusive reference to Alice and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) brother, and
at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found herself walking the room with quick, impetuous
steps, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) blood was hot with indignation.

<p/>All her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sympathies in the matter were with Alice. It never occurred
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to disbelieve a word of the statement made to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), or to
suggest to herself that it had been coloured by any fears or
exaggerations on the part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) correspondent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew that Alice
was true. And, moreover, much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) brother,--willing as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been and would still be to risk all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) possessed, and
herself also, on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) behalf,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew that it would be risking and
not trusting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) brother, such love having come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
by nature, and having remained with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) from of old; and in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
intellect she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) still believed. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had ceased to have belief in
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) conduct. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) feared everything that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might do, and lived with
a consciousness that though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was willing to connect all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own
fortunes with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had much reason to expect that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might
encounter ruin in doing so. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sin had been in this,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
been anxious to subject Alice to the same danger,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
intrigued, sometimes very meanly, to bring about the object which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had at heart,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had used all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) craft to separate Alice
from Mr. Grey. Perhaps it may be alleged in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) excuse that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
thought,--had hoped rather than thought,--that the marriage which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
contemplated would change much in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) brother that was wrong, and
bring him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) into a mode of life that would not be dangerous. Might not
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) and Alice together so work upon him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should cease to
stand ever on the brink of some half-seen precipice? To risk herself
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) brother was noble. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) used her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cunning in inducing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin to share that risk she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was ignoble. Of this she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
herself some consciousness, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) walked up and down the old
dining-room at midnight, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin's letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cheeks became tinged with shame as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought of the scene
which Alice had described,--the toy thrown beneath the grate, the
loud curses, the whispered threats, which had been more terrible
than curses, the demand for money, made with something worse than a
cut-throat's violence, the strong man's hand placed upon the woman's
arm in anger and in rage, those eyes glaring, and the gaping horror
of that still raw cicatrice, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face close to that
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) victim! Not for a moment did she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) think of defending him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
accused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to herself vehemently of a sin over and above those
sins which had filled Alice with dismay. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had demanded money
from the girl whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intended to marry! According to Kate's idea,
nothing could excuse or palliate this sin. Alice had accounted
it as nothing,--had expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) opinion that the demand was
reasonable;--even now, after the ill-usage to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been
subjected, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had declared that the money should be forthcoming, and
given to the man who had treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) so shamefully. It might be well
that Alice should so feel and so act, but it behoved Kate to feel
and act very differently. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother, even in the
house of death, should he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) come there, that his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) conduct was mean and
unmanly. Kate was no coward. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) declared to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would
do this even though he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should threaten her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) with all his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) fury,--though
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should glare upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) with all the horrors of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) countenance.

<p/>One o'clock, and two o'clock, still found her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) in the dark sombre
parlour, every now and then pacing the floor of the room. The fire
had gone out, and, though it was now the middle of April, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) began
to feel the cold. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would not go to bed before she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had written
a line to Alice. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) brother a message by telegraph would of
course be sent the next morning; as also would she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) send a message
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) aunt. But to Alice she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would write, though it might be but a
line. Cold as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) pens and paper, and wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
letter that night. It was very short. <div class="bookquote">``Dear Alice, to-day I received
your letter, and to-day our poor old grandfather died. Tell my uncle
John, with my love, of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father's death. You will understand that
I cannot write much now about that other matter; but I must tell you,
even at such a moment as this, that there shall be no quarrel between
you and me. There shall be none at least on my side. I cannot say
more till a few days shall have passed by. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is lying up-stairs,
a corpse. I have telegraphed to George, and I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will come
down. I think my aunt Greenow will come also, as I had written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
before, seeing that I wanted the comfort of having her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) here. Uncle
John will of course come or not as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) thinks fitting. I don't know
whether I am in a position to say that I shall be glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>);
but I should be very glad. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) and you will know that I can, as yet,
tell you nothing further. The lawyer is to see the men about the
funeral. Nothing, I suppose, will be done till George comes. Your own
cousin and friend, KATE VAVASOR.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) added a line below,
<div class="bookquote">``My own Alice,--If you will let me, you shall be my sister, and be
the nearest to me and the dearest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) received this, was at the first moment so much
struck, and indeed surprised, by the tidings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) grandfather's
death, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was forced, in spite of the still existing violence
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own feelings, to think and act chiefly with reference to that
event. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father had not then left his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) therefore went to
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and handed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) Kate's letter. <div class="bookquote">``Papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``there is news
from Westmoreland; bad news, which you hardly expected yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My
father is dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Vavasor/Mr. John Vavasor/Mr. Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said John Vavasor. Whereupon Alice gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) Kate's
letter, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) might read it. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I shall go down,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) said,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) came to that part in which Kate had spoken of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Does she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
think I shall not follow my father to the grave, because I dislike
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother? What does she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mean by saying that there shall be no
quarrel between you and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will explain that at another time,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. John Vavasor asked no further questions then, but
declared at first that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) should go to Westmoreland on the following
day. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) altered his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) purpose. <div class="bookquote">``I'll go by the mail train
to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It will be very disagreeable, but I ought to
be there when the will is opened.''  (<font color='red'><b>Queen</b></font>)</div>There was very little more said
in Queen Anne Street on the subject till the evening,--till a few
moments before Mr. Vavasor left his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) indeed had thought
nothing more about that quarrelling, or rather that promise that
there should be no quarrelling, between the girls. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) still regarded
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) nephew George as the man who, unfortunately, was to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
son-in-law, and now, during this tedious sad day, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) felt
himself compelled to remain at home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) busied his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) mind in thinking
of George and Alice, as living together at the old Hall. At six, the
father and daughter dined, and soon after dinner Mr. Vavasor went up
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) own room to prepare himself for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) journey. After a while
Alice followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>),--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not do so till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew that if
anything was to be told before the journey no further time could be
lost. <div class="bookquote">``Papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had shut the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``I think I ought to tell you before you go that everything is over
between me and George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you quarrelled with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) too?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father, with
uncontrolled surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should perhaps say that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has quarrelled with me. But, dear papa,
pray do not question me at present. I will tell you all when you come
back, but I thought it right that you should know this before you
went.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) doing then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot explain it to you in a hurry like this. Papa, you may
understand something of the shame which I feel, and you should not
question me now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And John Grey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is nothing different in regard to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be shot if I can understand you. George, you know, has had
two thousand pounds of your money,--of yours or somebody else's.
Well, we can't talk about it now, as I must be off. Thinking as I
do of George, I'm glad of it,--that's all.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went, and Alice
was left alone, to comfort herself as best she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might by her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own
reflections.

<p/>George Vavasor had received the message on the day previous to that
on which Alice's letter had reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), but it had not come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
till late in the day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) might have gone down by the mail train of
that night, but there were one or two persons, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) own attorney
especially, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) wished to see before the reading of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
grandfather's will. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) remained in town, therefore, on the following
day, and went down by the same train as that which took his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) uncle.
Walking along the platform, looking for a seat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) peered into a
carriage and met his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) uncle's eye. The two saw each other, but did not
speak, and George passed on to another carriage. On the following
morning, before the break of day, they met again in the refreshment
room, at the station at Lancaster. <div class="bookquote">``So my father has gone, George,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>said the uncle, speaking to the nephew. They must go to the same
house, and Mr. Vavasor felt that it would be better that they should
be on speaking terms when they reached it. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
has gone at last. I wonder what we shall find to have been his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) latest
act of injustice.''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>The reader will remember that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had received
Kate's first letter, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) of the Squire's
altered will. John Vavasor turned away disgusted. His (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) finer feelings
were perhaps not very strong, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had no thoughts or hopes in
reference to the matter which were mean. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) expected nothing himself,
and did not begrudge his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) nephew the inheritance. At this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
was thinking of the old Squire as a father who had ever been kind
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). It might be natural that George should have no such old
affection at his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) heart, but it was unnatural that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) should express
himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had done at such a moment.

<p/>The uncle turned away, but said nothing. George followed him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) with
a little proposition of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own. <div class="bookquote">``We shan't get any conveyance at
Shap,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Hadn't we better go over in a chaise from Kendal?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>To this the uncle assented, and so they finished their journey
together. George smoked all the time that they were in the carriage,
and very few words were spoken. As they drove up to the old house,
they found that another arrival had taken place before them,--Mrs.
Greenow having reached the house in some vehicle from the Shap
station. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had come across from Norwich to Manchester, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
had joined the train which had brought the uncle and nephew from
London.




<p/>CHAPTER LV.

<p/>The Will.


<p/>The coming of Mrs. Greenow at this very moment was a great comfort
to Kate. Without her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would hardly have known how to bear herself
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) uncle and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother. As it was, they were all restrained
by something of the courtesy which strangers are bound to show to
each other. George had never seen his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) aunt since he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was a child, and
some sort of introduction was necessary between them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you are George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow, putting out her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) hand and
smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I'm George,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And a Member of Parliament!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow. <div class="bookquote">``It's quite an
honour to the family. I felt so proud when I heard it!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) said this
pleasantly, meaning it to be taken for truth, and then turned away to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) brother. <div class="bookquote">``Papa's time was fully come,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``though, to tell
the truth, I had no idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) was so weak as Kate describes him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) to
have been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I, either,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Vavasor/Mr. John Vavasor/Mr. Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said John Vavasor. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) went to church with us here
on Christmas-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>), indeed? Dear, dear! He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) seems at last to have gone off just
like poor Greenow.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) handkerchief up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``I
think you didn't know Greenow, John?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I met him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) once,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) brother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wasn't to be known and understood in that way. I'm aware
there was a little prejudice, because of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) being in trade, but
we won't talk of that now. Where should I have been without him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>),
tradesman or no tradesman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was an excellent man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may say that, John. Ah, well! we can't keep everything in this
life for ever.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>It may, perhaps, be as well to explain now that Mrs.
Greenow had told Captain Bellfield at their last meeting before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) left Norwich, that, under certain circumstances, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) behaved
himself well, there might possibly be ground of hope. Whereupon
Captain Bellfield had immediately gone to the best tailor in that
city, had told the man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coming marriage, and had given an
extensive order. But the tailor had not as yet supplied the goods,
waiting for more credible evidence of the Captain's good fortune.
<div class="bookquote">``We're all grass of the field,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow, lightly brushing
a tear from her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) eye, <div class="bookquote">``and must be cut down and put into the oven in
our turns.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) brother uttered a slight sympathetic groan, shaking
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) head in testimony of the uncertainty of human affairs, and then
said that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would go out and look about the place. George, in the
meantime, had asked his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sister to show him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) room, and the two were
already together up-stairs.

<p/>Kate had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would say nothing about Alice at
the present moment,--nothing, if it could be avoided, till after the
funeral. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) led the way up-stairs, almost trembling with fear, for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) knew that that other subject of the will would also give rise to
trouble and sorrow,--perhaps, also, to determined quarrelling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What has brought that woman here?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>was the first question that
George asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why did you ask her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to come here?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George, angrily. Kate
immediately felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was speaking as though he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) were master of
the house, and also as though he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) intended to be master of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). As
regarded the former idea, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had no objection to it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) thoroughly
and honestly wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) might be the master; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
feared that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) might find himself mistaken in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) assumption, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
herself was not disposed to deny any appearance of right that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
might take upon himself in that respect. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had already begun to
tell herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) must not submit herself to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) masterdom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
had gradually so taught herself since he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had compelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) to write
the first letter in which Alice had been asked to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) money.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), George, before my poor grandfather's death, when I
thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would linger perhaps for weeks. My life here alone
with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), without any other woman in the house beside the servants,
was very melancholy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you not ask Alice to come to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice could not have come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, after a short pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know why she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) shouldn't have come. I won't have that woman
about the place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) disgraced herself by marrying a blacksmith--.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, George, it was you yourself who advised me to go and stay with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a very different thing. Now that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'s dead, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'s got his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
money, it's all very well that you should go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) occasionally; but
I won't have her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's natural that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father's house at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
father's death-bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate to be told that things are natural. It always means humbug.
I don't suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cared for the old man any more than I did,--or
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cared for the other old man who married her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). People are
such intense hypocrites. There's my uncle John, pulling a long face
because he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) has come into this house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) will pull it as long as
the body lies up there; and yet for the last twenty years there's
nothing on earth he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) has so much hated as going to see his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father.
When are they going to bury him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On Saturday, the day after to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why couldn't they do it to-morrow, so that we could get away before
Sunday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) only died on Monday, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, solemnly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Psha! Who has got the will?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Gogram. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gogram</b></font>) was here yesterday, and told me to tell you and uncle
John that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would have it with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) came back from the
funeral.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has my uncle John to do with it?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George, sharply. <div class="bookquote">``I
shall go over to Penrith this afternoon and make Gogram give it up to
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'ll do that, George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What right has he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to keep it? What right has he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to it at all? How do
I know that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has really got the old man's last will? Where did my
grandfather keep his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) papers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In that old secretary, as he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) used to call it; the one that stands in
the dining-room. It is sealed up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who sealed it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Gogram did,--Mr. Gogram and I together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What the deuce made you meddle with it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I merely assisted him (<font color='blue'><b>Gogram</b></font>). But I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Gogram</b></font>) was quite right. I think it
is usual in such cases.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Balderdash! You are thinking of some old trumpery of former days.
Till I know to the contrary, everything here belongs to me as
heir-at-law, and I do not mean to allow of any interference till I
know for certain that my rights have been taken from me. And I won't
accept a death-bed will. What a man chooses to write when his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fingers
will hardly hold the pen, goes for nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't suppose that I wish to interfere with your rights?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, George!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; I say, I hope not. But I know there are those who would. Do
you think my uncle John would not interfere with me if he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could?
By --! if he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) does, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) shall find that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) does it to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) cost. I'll
lead him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) such a life through the courts, for the next two or three
years, that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'ll wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had remained in Chancery Lane, and
had never left it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div><p/>A message was now brought up by the nurse, saying that Mrs. Greenow
and Mr. Vavasor were going into the room where the old Squire was
lying, <div class="bookquote">``Would Miss Kate and Mr. George go with them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Squire</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Vavasor!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>shouted out George, making the old woman jump. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did
not understand his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) meaning in the least. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir; the old Squire,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you come, George?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>Kate asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; what should I go there for? Why should I pretend an interest in
the dead body of a man whom I hated and who hated me;--whose very
last act, as far as I know as yet, was an attempt to rob me? I won't
go and see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Kate went, and was glad of an opportunity of getting away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
brother. Every hour the idea was becoming stronger in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mind that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) must in some way separate herself from him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). There had come upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) of late a hard ferocity which made him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) unendurable. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
carried to such a pitch that hatred, as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) called it, of conventional
rules, that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) allowed himself to be controlled by none of the
ordinary bonds of society. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had felt this heretofore, with a
nervous consciousness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was doing wrong in endeavouring to
bring about a marriage between him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) and Alice; but this demeanour and
mode of talking had now so grown upon him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that Kate began to feel
herself thankful that Alice had been saved.

<p/>Kate went up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) uncle and aunt, and saw the face of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
grandfather for the last time. <div class="bookquote">``Poor, dear old man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Greenow, as the easy tears ran down her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Do you remember, John,
how he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) used to scold me, and say that I should never come to good. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
has said the same thing to you, Kate, I dare say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) has been very kind to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, standing at the foot of the
bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was not one of those whose tears stand near their eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was a fine old gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Vavasor/Mr. John Vavasor/Mr. Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said John Vavasor;--<div class="bookquote">``belonging to days
that are now gone by, but by no means the less of a gentleman on that
account. I don't know that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ever did an unjust or ungenerous act to
any one. Come, Kate, we may as well go down.''  (<font color='red'><b>John Vavasor/Mr. John Vavasor/Mr. Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Greenow lingered to
say a word or two to the nurse, of the manner in which Greenow's body
was treated when Greenow was lying dead, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
brother and niece.

<p/>George did not go into Penrith, nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) see Mr. Gogram till that
worthy attorney came out to Vavasor Hall on the morning of the
funeral. He (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) said nothing more on the subject, nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) break the
seals on the old upright desk that stood in the parlour. The two
days before the funeral were very wretched for all the party, except,
perhaps, for Mrs. Greenow, who affected not to understand that her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
nephew was in a bad humour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``poor George,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and treated
all his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) incivility to herself as though it were the effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)
grief. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) questions about Parliament, which, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)
didn't answer, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) little stories about poor dear Greenow,
not heeding his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) expressions of unmistakable disgust.

<p/>The two days at last went by, and the hour of the funeral came. There
was the doctor and Gogram, and the uncle and the nephew, to follow
the corpse,--the nephew taking upon himself ostentatiously the
foremost place, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) could thereby help to maintain his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)
pretensions as heir. The clergyman met them at the little wicket-gate
of the churchyard, having, by some reasoning, which we hope was
satisfactory to himself, overcome a resolution which he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) at first
formed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) would not read the burial service over an unrepentant
sinner. But he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) did read it, having mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) scruples to none but
one confidential clerical friend in the same diocese.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm told that you have got my grandfather's will,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>George said to
the attorney as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have it in my pocket,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gogram/Gogram</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gogram, <div class="bookquote">``and purpose to read it as
soon as we return from church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gogram/Gogram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it usual to take a will away from a man's house in that way?''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>George asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite usual,''  (<font color='red'><b>the attorney</b></font>)</div>said the attorney; <div class="bookquote">``and in this case it was done at
the express desire of the testator.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the attorney</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it is the common practice,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Vavasor/Mr. John Vavasor/Mr. Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said John Vavasor.

<p/>George upon this turned round at his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) uncle as though about to attack
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) restrained himself and said nothing, though he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) showed his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
teeth.

<p/>The funeral was very plain, and not a word was spoken by George
Vavasor during the journey there and back. John Vavasor asked a few
questions of the doctor as to the last weeks of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) father's life;
and it was incidentally mentioned, both by the doctor and by the
attorney, that the old Squire's intellect had remained unimpaired
up to the last moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had been seen by either of them. When
they returned to the hall Mrs. Greenow met them with an invitation to
lunch. They all went to the dining-room, and drank each a glass of
sherry. George took two or three glasses. The doctor then withdrew,
and drove himself back to Penrith, where he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lived.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we go into the other room now?''  (<font color='red'><b>the attorney</b></font>)</div>said the attorney.

<p/>The three gentlemen then rose up, and went across to the
drawing-room, George leading the way. The attorney followed him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and
John Vavasor closed the door behind them. Had any observer been there
to watch them he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) might have seen by the faces of the two latter that
they expected an unpleasant meeting. Mr. Gogram, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gogram</b></font>) had walked
across the hall, had pulled a document out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gogram</b></font>) pocket, and held
it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gogram</b></font>) hand as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gogram</b></font>) took a chair. John Vavasor stood behind one of
the chairs which had been placed at the table, and leaned upon it,
looking across the room, up at the ceiling. George stood on the rug
before the fire, with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hands in the pockets of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) trousers, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) coat tails over his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen, will you sit down?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gogram/Gogram</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gogram.

<p/>John Vavasor immediately sat down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I prefer to stand here,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/>Mr. Gogram then opened the document before him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Before that paper is read,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George, <div class="bookquote">``I think it right to say
a few words. I don't know what it contains, but I believe it to
have been executed by my grandfather only an hour or two before his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)
death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the day before he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) died,--early in the day,''  (<font color='red'><b>the attorney</b></font>)</div>said the attorney.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,--the day before he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) died; it is the same thing,--while he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was
dying, in fact. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) never got out of bed afterwards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was not in bed at the time, Mr. Vavasor. Not that it would have
mattered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had been. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) came down to dinner on that day. I
don't understand, however, why you make these observations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you'll listen to me you will understand. I make them because I
deny my grandfather's fitness to make a will in the last moments of
his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) existence, and at such an age. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) a few weeks ago, and he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)
was not fit to be trusted with the management of property then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not think this is the time, George, to put forward such
objections,''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>said the uncle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``I believe that that paper purports to
be an instrument by which I should be villanously defrauded if it
were allowed to be held as good. Therefore I protest against it now,
and shall question it at law if action be taken on it. You can read
it now, if you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, I shall read,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gogram/Gogram</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gogram; <div class="bookquote">``and I say that it is as
valid a will as ever a man signed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gogram/Gogram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I say it's not. That's the difference between us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>The will was read amidst sundry interjections and expressions of
anger from George, which it is not necessary to repeat. Nor need I
trouble my readers with the will at length. It began by expressing
the testator's great desire that his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) property might descend in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
own family, and that the house might be held and inhabited by some
one bearing the name of Vavasor. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) then declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) felt
himself obliged to pass over his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) natural heir, believing that the
property would not be safe in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hands; he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) therefore left it in
trust to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) son John Vavasor, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) appointed to be sole executor
of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) devised it to George's eldest son,--should George
ever marry and have a son,--as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) might reach the age of
twenty-five. In the meantime the property should remain in the hands
of John Vavasor for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) use and benefit, with a lien on it of five
hundred a year to be paid annually to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) granddaughter Kate. In
the event of George having no son, the property was to go to the
eldest son of Kate, or failing that to the eldest son of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) other
granddaughter who might take the name of Vavasor. All his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) personal
property he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) left to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) son, John Vavasor. <div class="bookquote">``And, Mr. Vavasor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the attorney</b></font>)</div>said
the attorney, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) reading, <div class="bookquote">``you will, I fear, get very
little by that latter clause. The estate now owes nothing; but I
doubt whether the Squire had fifty pounds in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) banker's hands when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) died, and the value of the property about the place is very small.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) has been unwilling to spend anything during the last ten years,
but has paid off every shilling that the property owed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is as I supposed,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) voice was very unpleasant,
and so was the fire of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eyes and the ghastly rage of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) scarred
face. <div class="bookquote">``The old man has endeavoured in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) anger to rob me of
everything because I would not obey him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wickedness when I was
here with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a short while before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) died. Such a will as that can
stand nowhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As to that I have nothing to say at present,''  (<font color='red'><b>the attorney</b></font>)</div>said the attorney.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) other will,--the one he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made before that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I remember rightly we executed two before this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And where are they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not my business to know, Mr. Vavasor. I believe that I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
destroy one, but I have no absolute knowledge. As to the other, I can
say nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what do you mean to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George, turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) uncle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do! I shall carry out the will. I have no alternative. Your sister
is the person chiefly interested under it. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) gets five hundred a
year for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) life; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) marries and you don't, or if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has a
son and you don't, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) son will have the whole property.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>George stood for a few moments thinking. Might it not be possible
that by means of Alice and Kate together,--by marrying the
former,--perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) might still obtain possession of the property?
But that which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wanted was the command of the property at
once,--the power of raising money upon it instantly. The will had
been so framed as to make that impossible in any way. Kate's share in
it had not been left to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) unconditionally, but was to be received
even by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) through the hands of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) uncle John. Such a will shut him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
out from all his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hopes. <div class="bookquote">``It is a piece of d-- roguery,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by that, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gogram/Gogram</b></font>)</div>said Gogram, turning round towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gogram</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean exactly what I say. It is a piece of d-- roguery. Who was
in the room when that thing was written?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The signature was witnessed by--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't ask as to the signature. Who was in the room when the thing
was written?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was here with your grandfather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And no one else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one else. The presence of any one else at such a time would be
very unusual.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I regard the document simply as waste paper.''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>After saying
this, George Vavasor left the room, and slammed the door after him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never was insulted in such a way before,''  (<font color='red'><b>the attorney</b></font>)</div>said the attorney,
almost with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) is a disappointed and I fear a ruined man,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Vavasor/Mr. John Vavasor/Mr. Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said John Vavasor.
<div class="bookquote">``I do not think you need regard what he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) should not on that account insult me. I have only done my
duty. I did not even advise his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) grandfather. It is mean on his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) part
and unmanly. If he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) comes in my way again I shall tell him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) probably will not put himself in your way again, Mr. Gogram.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the attorney</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the attorney went, having suggested to Mr. Vavasor that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) should
instruct his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) attorney in London to take steps in reference to the
proving of the will. <div class="bookquote">``It's as good a will as ever was made,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gogram/Gogram</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Gogram. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Gogram</b></font>) can set that aside, I'll give up making wills
altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Who was to tell Kate? That was John Vavasor's first thought when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was left alone at the hall-door, after seeing the lawyer start
away. And how was he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) to get himself back to London without further
quarrelling with his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) nephew? And what was he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) to do at once with
reference to the immediate duties of proprietorship which were
entailed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) as executor? It was by no means improbable, as he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>)
thought, that George might assume to himself the position of master
of the house; that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) might demand the keys, for instance, which
no doubt were in Kate's hands at present, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would take
possession with violence. What should he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) do under such circumstances?
It was clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could not run away and get back to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) club by
the night mail train. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had duties there at the Hall, and these
duties were of a nature to make him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) almost regret the position in
which his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father's will had placed him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). Eventually he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would gain some
considerable increase to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) means, but the immediate effect would
be terribly troublesome. As he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) looked up at the melancholy pines
which were slowly waving their heads in the wind before the door
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) declared to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would sell his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) inheritance and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
executorship very cheaply, if such a sale were possible.

<p/>In the dining-room he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sister alone. <div class="bookquote">``Well, John,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>);
<div class="bookquote">``well? How is it left?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is Kate?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) has gone out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) take his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) to walk, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) went with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, I suppose, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>John Vavasor/Mr. John Vavasor/Mr. Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said John Vavasor. After that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) explained the circumstances of the will to Mrs. Greenow. <div class="bookquote">``Bravo,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the widow. <div class="bookquote">``I'm delighted. I love Kate dearly: and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
can marry almost whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) pleases.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LVI.

<p/>Another Walk on the Fells.


<p/>George when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) left the room in which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had insulted the lawyer,
went immediately across to the parlour in which his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) aunt and sister
were sitting. <div class="bookquote">``Kate,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``put on your hat and come and walk
with me. That business is over.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Kate's hat and shawl were in the
room, and they were out of the house together within a minute.

<p/>They walked down the carriage-road, through the desolate, untenanted
grounds, to the gate, before either of them spoke a word. Kate was
waiting for George to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) of the will, but did not dare to ask
any question. George intended to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) of the will, but was not
disposed to do so without some preparation. It was a thing not to be
spoken of open-mouthed, as a piece of ordinary news. <div class="bookquote">``Which way shall
we go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, as soon as they had passed through the old rickety
gate, which swung at the entrance of the place. <div class="bookquote">``Up across the fell,''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George; <div class="bookquote">``the day is fine, and I want to get away from my uncle
for a time.''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) turned round, therefore, outside the hill of firs,
and led the way back to the beacon wood through which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) and Alice
had walked across to Haweswater upon a memorable occasion. They
had reached the top of the beacon hill, and were out upon the Fell,
before George had begun his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) story. Kate was half beside herself with
curiosity, but still she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was afraid to ask. <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George,
when they paused a moment as they stepped over a plank that crossed
the boundary ditch of the wood: <div class="bookquote">``don't you want to know what that
dear old man has done for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) looked into her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) face very
steadfastly. <div class="bookquote">``But perhaps you know already,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) added. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had come
out determined not to quarrel with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sister. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had resolved,
in that moment of thought which had been allowed to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), that his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
best hope for the present required that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) should keep himself on
good terms with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), at any rate till he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had settled what line of
conduct he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would pursue. But he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was, in truth, so sore with anger
and disappointment,--he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had become so nearly mad with that continued,
unappeased wrath in which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) now indulged against all the world, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could not refrain himself from bitter words. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was as one driven
by the Furies, and was no longer able to control them in their
driving of him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate. <div class="bookquote">``Had I known I should have told
you. Your question is unjust to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am beginning to doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``whether a man can be safe in
trusting any one. My grandfather has done his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) best to rob me of the
property altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you that I feared he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) would do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) has made you his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) heir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) told me distinctly that he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) would not do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) has, I tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, George, I shall do that which I told him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) I should do in the
event of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) making such a will; for he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) asked me the question. I told
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) I should restore the estate to you, and upon that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) swore that
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would not leave it to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what a fool you were,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), stopping her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) in the pathway.
<div class="bookquote">``What an ass! Why did you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) that? You knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) would not,
on that account, do justice to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) asked me, George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Psha! now you have ruined me, and you might have saved me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I will save you still, if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has left the estate to me. I do not
desire to take it from you. As God in heaven sees me, I have never
ceased to endeavour to protect your interests here at Vavasor. I will
sign anything necessary to make over my right in the property to
you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then they walked on over the Fell for some minutes without
speaking. They were still on the same path,--that path which Kate and
Alice had taken in the winter,--and now poor Kate could not but think
of all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had said that day on George's behalf;--how had she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
mingled truth and falsehood in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) efforts to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother's
character in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cousin's eyes! It had all been done in vain. At
this very moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) own trouble Kate thought of John Grey, and
repented of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had done. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) hopes in that direction were
altogether blasted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother had ill-treated Alice,
and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) must tell him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) so if Alice's name were mentioned between
them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could no longer worship her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) brother, and hold herself at
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) command in all things. But, as regarded the property to which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
was naturally the heir, if any act of hers could give it to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), that
act would be done. <div class="bookquote">``If the will is as you say, George, I will make
over my right to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can make over nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``The old robber has been
too cunning for that; he (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) has left it all in the hands of my uncle
John. D-- him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). D-- them both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``George! George! he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is dead now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dead; of course he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is dead. What of that? I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had been dead
ten years ago,--or twenty. Do you suppose I am to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) because
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is dead? I'll heap his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) grave with curses, if that can be of avail
to punish him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can only punish the living that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I will punish them;--but not by cursing them. My uncle John
shall have such a life of it for the next year or two that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) shall
bitterly regret the hour in which he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) has stepped between me and my
rights.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) has done so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not done so! What was he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) down here for at Christmas? Do you pretend
to think that that make-believe will was concocted without his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
knowledge?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Kate thought for a moment before she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``It was only two days

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly. You told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that. And what did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very angry, and made me send for Mr. Gogram.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Kate, think a little before you answer me again. If ever you

is fair you shall have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was a fool not to have known her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) better than that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said, stopping, and stamping with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) foot upon
the crushed heather. <div class="bookquote">``George, you don't understand what it is to be
honest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) smiled,--with a slight provoking smile that passed very rapidly
from his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) face. The meaning of the smile was to be read, had Kate been

of the smile. <div class="bookquote">``Well, never mind about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``you advised my

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) paused a moment again before she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) answered him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) mind was

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, Kate; I do believe that you at any rate have no mind

hands of John Vavasor; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) has left you five hundred a year out of

have been mad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen to me, I tell you. I don't mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was a raging maniac.

he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was not in a fit condition?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can swear to that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I may not be called on to do so. I hope there may be no

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly. Now listen till you understand what it is I mean. That
will, if it stands, gives all the power over the estate to John
Vavasor. It renders you quite powerless as regards any help
or assistance that you might be disposed to give to me. But,
nevertheless, your interest under the will is greater than his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>),--or
than that of any one else,--for your son would inherit if I have
none. Do you understand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And your testimony as to the invalidity of the will would be

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would say in a court what I have told you, if that will do any
good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will not be enough. Look here, Kate; you must be steadfast here;
everything depends on you. How often have you told me that you will
stick to me throughout life? Now you will be tried.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Kate felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) repugnance towards him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>),--towards all that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was
doing and wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) to do,--was growing stronger within her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) at every
word he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) spoke. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was becoming gradually aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) desired from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) something which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) could not and would not do, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was aware
also that in refusing him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would have to encounter him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in all his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
wrath. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) set her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) teeth firmly together, and clenched her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) little
fist. If a fight was necessary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would fight with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). As he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) closely with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sinister eyes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) love towards him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
was almost turned to hatred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But that was what you meant when you advised him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) not to make the
will because you thought his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) intellect was impaired!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop, Kate, stop. If you will think of it, It was so. What is the
meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) judgement being weak?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't say his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) judgement was weak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that was what you meant when you advised him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) not to trust it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, George; I think I know now what you mean. If anybody asks
me if his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mind was gone, or his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) intellect deranged, I cannot say that
there was anything of the kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not. It would be untrue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you are determined to throw me over and claim the property for
yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) turned towards and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) as though he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
were resolved to frighten her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And I am to count you also among my
enemies? You had better take care, Kate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were now upon the fell side, more than three miles away from the
Hall; and Kate, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) looked round, saw that they were all alone.
Not a cottage,--not a sign of humanity was within sight. Kate saw
that it was so, and was aware that the fact pressed itself upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
as being of importance. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) thought again of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) resolution
to fight with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), if any fight were necessary; to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), in so
many words, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would separate herself from him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) and defy him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would not fear him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), let his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) words and face be ever so terrible!
Surely her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) own brother would do her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) no bodily harm. And even though
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should do so,--though he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should take her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) roughly by the arm as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
had done to Alice,--though he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should do worse than that, still she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
would fight him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) blood was the same as his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should know
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) courage was, at any rate, as high.

<p/>And, indeed, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had cause to fear. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
intended that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should fear. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) intended that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should dread what
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might do to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) at that moment. As to what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would do he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had no
resolve made. Neither had he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) resolved on anything when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had gone to
Alice and had shaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) rudely as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat beside him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had been
guided by no fixed intent when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had attacked John Grey, or when
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) insulted the attorney; but a Fury was driving him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was
conscious of being so driven. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) almost wished to be driven to some
act of frenzy. Everything in the world had gone against him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
desired to expend his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) rage on some one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kate,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), stopping her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``we will have this out here, if you
please. So much, at any rate, shall be settled to-day. You have made
many promises to me, and I have believed them. You can now keep them
all, by simply saying what you know to be the truth,--that that old
man was a drivelling idiot when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made this will. Are you prepared
to do me that justice? Think before you answer me, for, by G--, if
I cannot have justice among you, I will have revenge.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) breast up near to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) throat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take your hand down, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'm not such a fool that
you can frighten me in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Answer me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said, and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), having some part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) raiment
within his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) clutch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, George, that I should live to be so ashamed of my brother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Answer me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said again; and again he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have answered you. I will say nothing of the kind that you want
me to say. My grandfather, up to the latest moment that I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>),
knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was about. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was not an idiot. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was, I believe, only
carrying out a purpose fixed long before. You will not make me change
what I say by looking at me like that, nor get it by shaking me.
You don't know me, George, if you think you can frighten me like a
child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to the last word, still keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and
holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) by the cloak she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wore; but the violence of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) grasp had
relaxed itself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) finish her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) words, as though his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) object
had simply been to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) speak out to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had to say.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had done, <div class="bookquote">``That's to be it; is it? That's
your idea of honesty. The very name of the money being your own
has been too much for you. I wonder whether you and my uncle had
contrived it all between you beforehand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not dare to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is a man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
eyes brimming with tears, not through fear, but in very vexation at
the nature of the charge he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had brought against her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I not? You will see what I dare do. As for you, with all your
promises--. Kate, you know that I keep my word. Say that you will do
as I desire you, or I will be the death of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that you will murder me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Murder you! yes; why not? Treated as I have been among you, do you
suppose that I shall stick at anything? Why should I not murder
you--you and Alice, too, seeing how you have betrayed me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Alice!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) spoke the words she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) looked straight into his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
eyes, as though defying him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) herself were concerned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Alice, indeed! D-- hypocrite! There's a pair of you; cursed,
whining, false, intriguing hypocrites. There; go down and tell your
uncle and that old woman there that I threatened to murder you. Tell
the judge so, when you're brought into court to swear me out of my
property. You false liar!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) from him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) with great
violence, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) fell heavily upon the stony ground.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did not stop to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) up, or even to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) lay,
but walked away across the heath, neither taking the track on towards
Haweswater, nor returning by the path which had brought them thither.
He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) went away northwards across the wild fell; and Kate, having risen
up and seated herself on a small cairn of stones which stood there,
watched him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) descended the slope of the hill till he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was out
of sight. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did not run, but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) seemed to move rapidly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
never once turned round to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) went away, down the hill
northwards, and presently the curving of the ground hid him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
view.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) first seated herself her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) thoughts had been altogether of
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had feared no personal injury, even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would murder her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) blood had been hot within her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) veins,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) heart had been full of defiance. Even yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) feared nothing,
but continued to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) misery, and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) disgrace. That
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was gone for ever, utterly and irretrievably ruined, thrown out,
as it were, beyond the pale of men, was now certain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). And this
was the brother in whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had believed; for whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had not only
been willing to sacrifice herself, but for whose purposes she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had
striven to sacrifice her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cousin! What would he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) do now? As he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) passed
from out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) sight down the hill, it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) as though he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
were rushing straight into some hell from which there could be no
escape.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: Kate.-RSB-


<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) arm had been hurt in the fall, but for a while she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
would not move it or feel it, being resolved to take no account of
what might have happened to herself. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had been gone some
ten minutes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) feet, and finding that the movement
pained her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) greatly, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) right arm was powerless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) put up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) left hand and became aware that the bone of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) arm was broken
below the elbow. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) first thought was given to the telling him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) of
this, or the not telling, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) should meet him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) below at the
house. How should she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mention the accident to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)? Should she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) lie,
and say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had fallen as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) came down the hill alone? Of
course he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would not believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), but still some such excuse as that
might make the matter easier for them all. It did not occur to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) might not see him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) again at all that day; and that, as far as
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was concerned, there might be need for no lie.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) started off to walk down home, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) right arm steadily
against her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) body with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) left hand. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) must give some
account of herself when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) got to the house; but it was of the
account to be given to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) thought. As to the others she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
cared little for them. <div class="bookquote">``Here I am; my arm is broken; and you had
better send for a doctor.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That would be sufficient for them.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) got into the wood the path was very dark. The heavens were
overcast with clouds, and a few drops began to fall. Then the rain
fell faster and faster, and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had gone a quarter of a mile
down the beacon hill, the clouds had opened themselves, and the
shower had become a storm of water. Suffering as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) stood up
for a few moments under a large tree, taking the excuse of the rain
for some minutes of delay, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) might make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mind as to what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would say. Then it occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) might possibly meet
him (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) again before she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) reached the house; and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) thought of it,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) began for the first time to fear him (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) come out upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
from the trees and really kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) way round, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) got out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) sight, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) might fall upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) suddenly and do
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had threatened? As the idea came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) made a little
attempt to run, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) found that running was impracticable from the
pain the movement caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) walked on through the hard
rain, steadily holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) arm against her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) side, but still looking
every moment through the trees on the side from which George might be
expected to reach her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). But no one came near her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) way homewards.
Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) been calm enough to think of the nature of the ground, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
might have known that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could not have returned upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) so quickly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) must have come back up the steep hill-side which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
descend. No;--he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had gone away altogether, across the fells towards
Bampton, and was at this moment vainly buttoning his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) coat across his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
breast, in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) unconscious attempt to keep out the wet. The Fury was
driving him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) on, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) himself was not aware whither he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was driven.

<p/>Dinner at the Hall had been ordered at five, the old hour; or rather
that had been assumed to be the hour for dinner without any ordering.
It was just five when Kate reached the front door. This she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) opened
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) left hand, and turning at once into the dining-room, found
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) uncle and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt standing before the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dinner is ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Vavasor/Mr. John Vavasor/Mr. Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said John Vavasor; <div class="bookquote">``where is George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>John Vavasor/Mr. John Vavasor/Mr. Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are wet, Kate,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said aunt Greenow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am very wet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate. <div class="bookquote">``I must go up-stairs. Perhaps you'll
come with me, aunt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come with you,--of course I will.''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>Aunt Greenow had seen at once
that something was amiss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's George?''  (<font color='red'><b>John Vavasor/Mr. John Vavasor/Mr. Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said John Vavasor. <div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) come back with you, or
are we to wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Kate seated herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">``I don't quite know where he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said. In the meantime her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt had hastened up to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) side just
in time to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was falling from her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">``My arm,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, very gently; <div class="bookquote">``my arm!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) slipped down against her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
aunt, and had fainted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has done her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) a mischief,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow, looking up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
brother. <div class="bookquote">``This is his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John Vavasor/Mr. John Vavasor/Mr. Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>John Vavasor stood confounded, wishing himself back in Queen Anne
Street.




<p/>CHAPTER LVII.

<p/>Showing How the Wild Beast Got Himself Back from the Mountains.


<p/>About eleven o'clock on that night,--the night of the day on which
Kate Vavasor's arm had been broken,--there came a gentle knock at
Kate's bedroom door. There was nothing surprising in this, as of all
the household Kate only was in bed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt was sitting at this time
by her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) bedside, and the doctor, who had been summoned from Penrith
and who had set her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) broken arm, was still in the house, talking
over the accident with John Vavasor in the dining-room, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
proceeded back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) journey home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) will do very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor. <div class="bookquote">``It's only a simple
fracture. I'll see her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) the day after to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it not odd that such an accident should come from a fall whilst
walking?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Vavasor.

<p/>The doctor shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``One never can say how anything
may occur,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I know a young woman who broke the os femoris
by just kicking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cat;--at least, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! I suppose you didn't take any trouble to inquire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much. My business was with the injury, not with the way she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) got
it. Somebody did make inquiry, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stuck to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) story and nothing
came of it. Good night, Mr. Vavasor. Don't trouble her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with questions
till she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has had some hours' sleep, at any rate.''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>Then the doctor
went, and John Vavasor was left alone, standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) back to the
dining-room fire.

<p/>There had been so much trouble and confusion in the house since Kate
had fainted, almost immediately upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) reaching home, that Mr.
Vavasor had not yet had time to make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) mind as to the nature of
the accident which had occurred. Mrs. Greenow had at once ascertained
that the bone was broken, and the doctor had been sent for. Luckily
he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had been found at home, and had reached the Hall a little before
ten o'clock. In the meantime, as soon as Kate recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) senses,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) volunteered her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) account of what had occurred.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother had quarrelled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) about the will, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said, and had
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) abruptly on the mountain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had fallen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) went on to
say, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) turned from him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and had at once found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had hurt
herself. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had been too angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to let him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) know it; and,
indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had not known the extent herself till he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had passed out
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) sight. This was her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) story; and there was nothing in it that
was false by the letter, though there was much that was false in the
spirit. It was certainly true that George had not known that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was
injured. It was true that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) for no help. It was true,
in one sense, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had fallen, and it was true that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had not
herself known how severe had been the injury done to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had
gone beyond the reach of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) voice. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) repressed all mention
of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) violence, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was pressed as to the nature of the
quarrel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) declined to speak further on that matter.

<p/>Neither her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) uncle nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). That was a matter of
course, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) knew that they did not believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). George's absence,
their recent experience of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) moods, and the violence by which her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
arm must have been broken, made them certain that Kate had more to
tell if she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) chose to tell it. But in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) present condition they could
not question her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). Mrs. Greenow did ask as to the probability of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
nephew's return.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can only tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) went away across the Fell
in the direction of Bampton. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) has gone on to Penrith. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
was very angry with us all; and as the house is not his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) own, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) has
probably resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) will not stay another night under the roof.
But, who can say? He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) is not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) senses when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) is angered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/>John Vavasor, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) stood alone after the doctor's departure,
endeavoured to ascertain the truth by thinking of it. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``that the doctor suspects that there has been
violence. I know it from his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) tone, and I can see it in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) eye. But
how to prove it? and would there be good in proving it? Poor girl!
Will it not be better for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to let it pass as though we believed
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) story?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) mind that it would be better. Why should
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) take upon himself the terrible task of calling this insane
relation to account for an act which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) could not prove? The will
itself, without that trouble, would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) trouble enough. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
began to long that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was back at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) club, and to think that the
signing-room in Chancery Lane was not so bad. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) went up to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) bed, calling at Kate's door to ask after the patient.

<p/>In the meantime there had come a messenger to Mrs. Greenow, who had
stationed herself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) niece. One of the girls of the house
brought up a scrap of paper to the door, saying that a boy had
brought it over with a cart from Shap, and that it was intended for
Miss Vavasor, and it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) who knocked at the sickroom door. The
note was open and was not addressed; indeed, the words were written
on a scrap of paper that was crumpled up rather than folded, and were
as follows: <div class="bookquote">``Send me my clothes by the bearer. I shall not return to
the house.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Greenow took it in to Kate, and then went away to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) nephew's things duly put into his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) portmanteau. This was sent away
in the cart, and Mr. Vavasor, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) went up-stairs, was told what had
been done.

<p/>Neither on that night or on the following day did Mrs. Greenow ask any
further questions; but on the morning after that, when the doctor had
left them with a good account of the broken limb, her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) curiosity would
brook no further delay. And, indeed, indignation as well as curiosity
urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) on. In disposition she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was less easy, and, perhaps, less
selfish, than her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) brother. If it were the case that that man had
ill-treated his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister, she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) would have sacrificed much to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
to punishment. <div class="bookquote">``Kate,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) said, when the doctor was gone, <div class="bookquote">``I expect
that you will tell me the whole truth as to what occurred between you
and your brother when you had this accident.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have told you the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But not the whole truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the truth I mean to tell, aunt. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has quarrelled with me, as I
think, most unnecessarily, but you don't suppose that I am going to
give an exact account of the quarrel? We were both wrong, probably,
and so let there be an end of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) violent to you when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) quarrelled with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is angry he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is always violent in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) language.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, did he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) strike you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear aunt, don't be angry with me if I say that I won't be
cross-examined. I would rather answer no more questions about it.
I know that questioning can do no good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Greenow knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) niece well enough to be aware that nothing
more would be told her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was quite sure now that Kate had not
broken her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) arm by a simple fall. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was certain that the injury had
come from positive violence. Had it not been so, Kate would not have
contented herself with refusing to answer the last question that had
been asked, but would also have repelled the charge made against her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
brother with indignation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must have it your own way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow; <div class="bookquote">``but let me just
tell you this, that your brother George had better keep out of my
way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is probable that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate. <div class="bookquote">``Especially if you remain
here to nurse me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Kate's conduct in answering all the questions made to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was not
difficult, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) found that there was much difficulty in planning
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) own future behaviour towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) own brother. Must she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) abandon
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) altogether from henceforth; divide herself from him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), as it were;
have perfectly separate interests, and interests that were indeed
hostile? and must she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) see him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ruined and overwhelmed by want of
money, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had been made a rich woman by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) grandfather's
will? It will be remembered that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) life had hitherto been devoted
to him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>); that all her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) schemes and plans had had his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) success as their
object; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had taught herself to consider it to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) duty to
sacrifice everything to his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) welfare. It is very sad to abandon the
only object of a life! It is very hard to tear out from one's heart
and fling away from it the only love that one has cherished! What was
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) to say to Alice about all this--to Alice whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had cheated of
a husband worthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might allure her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) into the arms of
one so utterly unworthy? Luckily for Kate, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) accident was of such a
nature that any writing to Alice was now out of the question.

<p/>But a blow! What woman can bear a blow from a man, and afterwards
return to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with love? A wife may have to bear it and to return.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) may return with that sort of love which is a thing of custom.
The man is the father of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) children, and earns the bread which they
eat and which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eats. Habit and the ways of the world require that
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should be careful in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) interests, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should live with
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in what amity is possible to them. But as for love,--all that we
mean by love when we speak of it and write of it,--a blow given by
the defender to the defenceless crushes it all! A woman may forgive
deceit, treachery, desertion,--even the preference given to a rival.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may forgive them and forget them; but I do not think that a woman
can forget a blow. And as for forgiveness,--it is not the blow that
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cannot forgive, but the meanness of spirit that made it possible.

<p/>Kate, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) thought of it, told herself that everything in life was
over for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had long feared her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother's nature,--had feared
that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was hard and heartless; but still there had been some hope
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) fear. Success, if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could be made to achieve it, would
soften him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and then all might be right. But now all was wrong, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) knew that it was so. When he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had compelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) to write to Alice
for money, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) faith in him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had almost succumbed. That had been very
mean, and the meanness had shocked her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). But now he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to
perjure herself that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might have his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own way, and had threatened
to murder her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and had raised his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hand against her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had refused to obey him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had accused her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) of treachery to
himself,--had accused her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) of premeditated deceit in obtaining this
property for herself!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) does not believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate to herself. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said that
because he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thought it would vex me; but I know he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) does not think it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>Kate had watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother longing for money all his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) life,--had
thoroughly understood the intensity of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wish for it,--the agony
of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) desire. But so far removed was she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) from any such longing on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) own account, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) could not believe that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother would in
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) heart accuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) of it. How often had she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) offered to give him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), on
the instant, every shilling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had in the world! At this moment
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) resolved, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mind, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) never wished to see him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) more; but
even now, had it been practicable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would have made over to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>),
without any drawback, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) interest in the Vavasor estate.

<p/>But any such making over was impossible. John Vavasor remained in
Westmoreland for a week, and during that time many discussions were,
of course, held about the property. Mr. Round came down from London,
and met Mr. Gogram at Penrith. As to the validity of the will Mr. Round
said that there was no shadow of a doubt. So an agent was appointed
for receiving the rents, and it was agreed that the old Hall should
be let in six months from that date. In the meantime Kate was to
remain there till her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) arm should become strong, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) could make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) plans for the future. Aunt Greenow promised to remain at the Hall
for the present, and offered, indeed, indefinite services for the
future, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) were quite forgetful of Captain Bellfield. Of
Mr. Cheesacre she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) was not forgetful, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) still continued to speak
of that gentleman to Kate, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) were Kate's suitor. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
did not now press upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) niece the acceptance of Mr. Cheesacre's
hand as an absolute duty. Kate was mistress of a considerable
fortune, and though such a marriage might be comfortable, it was no
longer necessary. Mrs. Greenow called him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) poor Cheesacre, pointing
out how easily he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) might be managed, and how indubitable were his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
possessions; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) no longer spoke of Kate's chances in the
marriage market as desperate, even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) should decline the
Cheesacre alliance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A young woman, with six hundred a year, my dear, may do pretty
nearly what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pleases,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said aunt Greenow. <div class="bookquote">``It's better than having
ten years' grace given you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And will last longer, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate.

<p/>Kate's desire was that Alice should come down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) for a while in
Westmoreland, before the six months were over, and this desire she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
mentioned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) uncle. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) promised to carry the message up to Alice,
but could not be got to say more than that upon the subject. Then Mr.
Vavasor went away, leaving the aunt and niece together at the Hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What on earth shall we do if that wild beast shows himself suddenly
among us women?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Greenow of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) brother.

<p/>The brother could only say, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hoped the wild beast would keep
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) distance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The brother</b></font>)</div><p/>And the wild beast did keep his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) distance, at any rate as long as Mrs.
Greenow remained at the Hall. We will now go back to the wild beast,
and tell how he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) walked across the mountains, in the rain, to Bampton,
a little village at the foot of Haweswater. It will be remembered
that after he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had struck his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) turned away from her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and
walked with quick steps down the mountain-side, never turning back
to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had found himself to be without any power of
persuasion over her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), as regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) evidence to be given, if the
will were questioned. The more he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) threatened her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) the steadier she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had
been in asserting her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) belief in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) grandfather's capacity. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had
looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) eye and defied him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had felt himself to be
worsted. What was he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to do? In truth, there was nothing for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to
do. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would murder her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>); and in the state of
mind to which his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) fury had driven him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), murder had suggested itself
to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) as a resource to which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might apply himself. But what could
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) gain by murdering her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>),--or, at any rate, by murdering her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) then,
out on the mountain-side? Nothing but a hanging! There would be
no gratification even to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) revenge. If, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had murdered
that old man, who was now, unfortunately, gone beyond the reach of
murder;--if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could have poisoned the old man's cup before that last
will had been made--there might have been something in such a deed!
But he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had merely thought of it, letting <div class="bookquote">``I dare not wait upon I
would'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) now told himself, with much self-reproach. Nothing was
to be got by killing his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister. So he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) restrained himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
passion, and walked away from her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), solitary, down the mountain.

<p/>The rain soon came on, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) exposed on the hill-side. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
thought little about it, but buttoned his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) coat, as I have said
before, and strode on. It was a storm of rain, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was forced
to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) head to one side, as it hit him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) from the north. But with
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hat, and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) head bent against the wind, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) went on
till he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had reached the valley at the foot, and found that the track
by which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had been led thither had become a road. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had never
known the mountains round the Hall as Kate had known them, and was
not aware whither he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was going. On one thing only had he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
mind since he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had left his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister, and that was that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would not
return to the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could do nothing there to serve
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) purpose; his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) threats would be vain impotence; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had no longer
any friend in the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could hardly tell himself what line of
conduct he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would pursue, but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would hurry back
to London, and grasp at whatever money he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could get from Alice. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
was still, at this moment, a Member of Parliament; and as the rain
drenched him (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) through and through, he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) endeavoured to get consolation
from the remembrance of that fact in his (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) favour.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) got near the village he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) overtook a shepherd boy coming down
from the hills, and learned his (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) whereabouts from him (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Baampton,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy, with an accent that was almost Scotch, when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was
asked the name of the place. When Vavasor further asked whether a
gig were kept there, the boy simply stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), not knowing a
gig by that name. At last, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was made to understand the
nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) companion's want, and expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) belief that <div class="bookquote">``John
Applethwaite, up at the Craigs yon, had got a mickle cart.''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>But the
Craigs was a farm-house, which now came in view about a mile off, up
across the valley; and Vavasor, hoping that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might still find a
speedier conveyance than John Applethwaite's mickle cart, went on to
the public-house in the village. But, in truth, neither there, nor
yet from John Applethwaite, to whom at last an application was sent,
could he (<font color='blue'><b>Applethwaite</b></font>) get any vehicle; and between six and seven he (<font color='blue'><b>Applethwaite</b></font>) started off
again, through the rain, to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Applethwaite</b></font>) weary way on foot to Shap. The
distance was about five miles, and the little byways, lying between
walls, were sticky, and almost glutinous with light-coloured, chalky
mud. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Applethwaite</b></font>) started he (<font color='blue'><b>Applethwaite</b></font>) took a glass of hot rum-and-water, but the
effect of that soon passed away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Applethwaite</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Applethwaite</b></font>) became colder
and weaker than he (<font color='blue'><b>Applethwaite</b></font>) had been before.

<p/>Wearily and wretchedly he (<font color='blue'><b>Applethwaite</b></font>) plodded on. A man may be very weary in such
a walk as that, and yet be by no means wretched. Tired, hungry, cold,
wet, and nearly penniless, I have sat me down and slept among those
mountain tracks,--have slept because nature refused to allow longer
wakefulness. But my heart has been as light as my purse, and there
has been something in the air of the hills that made me buoyant and
happy in the midst of my weariness. But George Vavasor was wretched
as well as weary, and every step that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) took, plodding through the
mud, was a new misfortune to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>). What are five miles of a walk to
a young man, even though the rain be falling and the ways be dirty?
what, though they may come after some other ten that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has already
traversed on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet? His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister Kate would have thought nothing
of the distance. But George stopped on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) way from time to time,
leaning on the loose walls, and cursing the misfortune that had
brought him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to such a pass. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cursed his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) grandfather, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) uncle, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
sister, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cousin, and himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cursed the place in which his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
forefathers had lived, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cursed the whole county. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cursed the
rain, and the wind, and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) town-made boots, which would not keep
out the wet slush. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cursed the light as it faded, and the darkness
as it came. Over and over again he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cursed the will that had robbed
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and the attorney that had made it. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cursed the mother that
had borne him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and the father that had left him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) poor. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thought
of Scruby, and cursed him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), thinking how that money would be again
required of him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) by that stern agent. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cursed the House of Commons,
which had cost him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) so much, and the greedy electors who would not
send him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) there without his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) paying for it. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cursed John Grey, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
thought of those two thousand pounds, with double curses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) cursed
this world, and all worlds beyond; and thus, cursing everything, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) way at last up to the inn at Shap.

<p/>It was nearly nine when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) got there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had wasted over an hour at
Bampton in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) endeavour to get John Applethwaite's cart to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
on, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had been two hours on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) walk from Bampton to Shap,--two
hours amidst his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) cursing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) ordered supper and brandy-and-water,
and, as we know, sent off a Mercury for his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) clothes. But the
Mercuries of Westmoreland do not move on quick wings, and it was past
midnight before he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) possessions. During all this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had,
by no means, ceased from cursing, but continued it over his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) broiled
ham and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) swallowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) brandy-and-water. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) swore aloud, so
that the red-armed servant at the inn could not but hear him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), that
those thieves at the Hall intended to rob him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) clothes;--that
they would not send him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) property. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) could not restrain himself,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) knew that every word he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) uttered would injure his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) cause, as
regarded the property in Westmoreland, if ever he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) could make a cause.
He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had been mad to strike his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) sister, and cursed himself
for his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) madness. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) could not restrain himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) told himself
that the battle for him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was over, and he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) thought of poison for
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) thought of poison, and a pistol,--of the pistols he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had
ever loaded at home, each with six shots, good for a life apiece. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
thought of an express train, rushing along at its full career, and of
the instant annihilation which it would produce. But if that was to
be the end of him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) would not go alone. No, indeed! why should he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
go alone, leaving those pistols ready loaded in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) desk? Among them
they had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) to ruin and to death. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) a man to pardon his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
enemies when it was within his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) power to take them with him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), down,
down, down--? What were the last words upon his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) impious lips, as with
bloodshot eyes, half drunk, and driven by the Fury, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) took himself
off to the bed prepared for him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), cursing aloud the poor red-haired
girl as he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) went, I may not utter here.




<p/>CHAPTER LVIII.

<p/>The Pallisers at Breakfast.


<p/>Gentle reader, do you remember Lady Monk's party, and how it
ended,--how it ended, at least as regards those special guests with
whom we are concerned? Mr. Palliser went away early, Mrs. Marsham
followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) house in Park Lane, caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) at home, and told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) tale. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife, found her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) sitting with Burgo in
the dining-room, under the Argus eyes of the constant Bott, and bore
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) away home. Burgo disappeared utterly from the scene, and Mr. Bott,
complaining inwardly that virtue was too frequently allowed to be its
own reward, comforted himself with champagne, and then walked off
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) lodgings. Lady Monk, when Mr. Palliser made his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) way into her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>)
room up-stairs, seeking his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife's scarf,--which little incident,
also, the reader may perhaps remember,--saw that the game was up, and
thought with regret of the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) two hundred pounds. Such was
the ending of Lady Monk's party.

<p/>Lady Glencora, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) journey home in the carriage with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband,
had openly suggested that Mrs. Marsham had gone to Park Lane to tell
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) doings with Burgo, and had declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) resolution never again
to see either that lady or Mr. Bott in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) own house. This she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) said
with more of defiance in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) tone than Mr. Palliser had ever hitherto
heard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was by nature less ready than her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>), and knowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) own
deficiency in that respect, abstained from all answer on the subject.
Indeed, during that drive home very few further words were spoken
between them. <div class="bookquote">``I will breakfast with you to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>),
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) prepared to go up-stairs. <div class="bookquote">``I have work still to do to-night,
and I will not disturb you by coming to your room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't want me to be very early?''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), with more of anger in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) voice than he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had yet shown.
<div class="bookquote">``What hour will suit you? I must say something of what has occurred
to-night before I leave you to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you can have got to say about to-night, but I'll
be down by half-past eleven, if that will do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>Mr. Palliser said that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would make it do, and then they parted.

<p/>Lady Glencora had played her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) part very well before her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
had declined to be frightened by him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); had been the first to mention
Burgo's name, and had done so with no tremor in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) voice, and had
boldly declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) irreconcilable enmity to the male and female
duennas who had dared to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) in charge. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was in the
carriage with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) felt some triumph in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) own strength;
and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) good night on the staircase, and slowly walked
up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) room, without having once lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) eyes before his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),
something of this consciousness of triumph still supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>). And
even while her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) maid remained with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) held herself up, as it
were, inwardly, telling herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would not yield,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
would not be cowed either by her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband or by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) spies. But when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was left alone all her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) triumph departed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) maid go while she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was still sitting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
dressing-gown; and when the girl was gone she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) got close over the
fire, sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) slippers on the fender, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) elbows on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) knees, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) face resting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) hands. In this position she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
remained for an hour, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) eyes fixed on the altering shapes of
the hot coals. During this hour her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) spirit was by no means defiant,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) thoughts of herself anything but triumphant. Mr. Bott and
Mrs. Marsham she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) had forgotten altogether. After all, they were but
buzzing flies, who annoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) by their presence. Should she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) choose
to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) husband, they could not prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). It was
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) husband and of Burgo that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) was thinking,--weighing them one
against the other, and connecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) own existence with theirs, not
as expecting joy or the comfort of love from either of them, but with
an assured conviction that on either side there must be misery for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>). But of that shame before all the world which must be hers for
ever, should she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) break her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) vows and consent to live with a man who
was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) husband, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) thought hardly at all. That which in the
estimation of Alice was everything, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), at this moment, was
almost nothing. For herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been sacrificed; and,--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
told herself with bitter denunciations against herself,--had been
sacrificed through her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own weakness. But that was done. Whatever way
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might go, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was lost. They had married her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to a man who cared
nothing for a wife, nothing for any woman,--so at least she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) declared
to herself,--but who had wanted a wife that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have an heir.
Had it been given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to have a child, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might
have been happy,--sufficiently happy in sharing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) husband's joy in
that respect. But everything had gone against her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). There was nothing
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) home to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) comfort. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looks at me every time he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
sees me as the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) misfortune,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself. Of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) husband's rank, of the future possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) title and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
estates, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought much. But of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own wealth she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought nothing.
It did not occur to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) enough in that respect
to make his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) marriage with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) a comfort to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) took it for
granted that that marriage was now one distasteful to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), as it was
to herself, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would eventually be the gainer if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should
so conduct herself that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) marriage might be dissolved.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: Lady Glencora.-RSB-


<p/>As to Burgo, I doubt whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) deceived herself much as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
character. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) knew well enough that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was a man infinitely less
worthy than her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was a spendthrift, idle,
given to bad courses,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) drank, that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) gambled, that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lived
the life of the loosest man about the town. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) knew also that
whatever chance she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) might have had to redeem him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), had she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) married
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) honestly before all the world, there could be no such chance
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) went to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mistress, abandoning her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband and all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) duties, and making herself vile in the eyes of all women. Burgo
Fitzgerald would not be influenced for good by such a woman as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
would then be. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew much of the world and its ways, and told
herself no lies about this. But, as I have said before, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not
count herself for much. What though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were ruined? What though
Burgo were false, mean, and untrustworthy? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was
the only man she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ever had loved! Lower and lower she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) crouched before
the fire; and then, when the coals were no longer red, and the shapes
altered themselves no more, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) crept into bed. As to what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should
say to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband on the following morning,--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not yet begun
to think of that.

<p/>Exactly at half-past eleven she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) entered the little breakfast parlour
which looked out over the park. It was the prettiest room in the
house, and now, at this springtide, when the town trees were putting
out their earliest greens, and were fresh and bright almost as
country trees, it might be hard to find a prettier chamber. Mr.
Palliser was there already, sitting with the morning paper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) rose when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) entered, and, coming up to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), just touched
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) lips. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheek up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), and then took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
place at the breakfast table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you any headache this morning?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) tea and his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) toast, spoke some
word to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) about the fineness of the weather, told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) some scraps
of news, and soon returned to the absorbing interest of a speech made
by the leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords. The speech was
very interesting to Mr. Palliser, because in it the noble lord alluded
to a break-up in the present Cabinet, as to which the rumours were,
he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) said, so rife through the country as to have destroyed all that
feeling of security in the existing Government which the country so
much valued and desired. Mr. Palliser had as yet heard no official
tidings of such a rupture; but if such rupture were to take place,
it must be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) favour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) felt himself at this moment to be full
of politics,--to be near the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) ambition, to have affairs
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hands which required all his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) attention. Was it absolutely
incumbent on him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) to refer again to the incidents of last night? The
doing so would be odious to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). The remembrance of the task now
immediately before him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) destroyed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) political satisfaction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
did not believe that his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife was in any serious danger. Might it not
yet be possible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) to escape from the annoyance, and to wash
his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) mind clean of all suspicion? He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was not jealous; he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was indeed
incapable of jealousy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) knew what it would be to be dishonoured,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) knew that under certain circumstances the world would expect
him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) to exert himself in a certain way. But the thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had now
to do was a great trouble to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would rather have to address
the House of Commons with ten columns of figures than utter a word
of remonstrance to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife. But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had defied him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>),--defied him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
by saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would see his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) friends no more; and it was the
remembrance of this, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) sat behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) newspaper, that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
ultimately feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could not pass in silence over what had been
done.

<p/>Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) went on reading, or pretending to read, as long as
the continuance of the breakfast made it certain that his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife would
remain with him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). Every now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said some word to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) of
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was reading, endeavouring to use the tone of voice that was
customary to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) domestic teachings of politics. But through
it all there was a certain hesitation,--there were the sure signs of
an attempt being made, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was himself conscious, and which
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) understood with the most perfect accuracy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was deferring the
evil moment, and vainly endeavouring to make himself believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
was comfortably employed the while. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had no newspaper, and made no
endeavour to deceive herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), therefore, was the first to begin
the conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Plantagenet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you told me last night, as I was going to
bed, that you had something to say about Lady Monk's party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) put down the newspaper slowly, and turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Yes, my
dear. After what happened, I believe that I must say something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you think anything, pray say it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not always easy for a man to show what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thinks by what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
says,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``My fear is that you should suppose me to think
more than I do. And it was for that reason that I determined to sleep
on it before I spoke to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If anybody is angry with me I'd much rather they should have it out
with me while their anger is hot. I hate cold anger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am not angry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what husbands always say when they're going to scold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am not going to scold. I am only going to advise you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd sooner be scolded. Advice is to anger just what cold anger is to
hot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear Glencora, surely if I find it necessary to speak--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to stop you, Plantagenet. Pray, go on. Only it will be
so nice to have it over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was now more than ever averse to the task before him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). Husbands,
when they give their wives a talking, should do it out of hand,
uttering their words hard, sharp, and quick,--and should then go.
There are some works that won't bear a preface, and this work of
marital fault-finding is one of them. Mr. Palliser was already
beginning to find out the truth of this. <div class="bookquote">``Glencora,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I wish
you to be serious with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very serious,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) replied, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) settled herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) chair
with an air of mockery, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) eyes and mouth were bright and
eloquent with a spirit which her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband did not love to see. Poor
girl! There was seriousness enough in store for her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would
be able to leave the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to be serious. Do you know why Mrs. Marsham came here from
Lady Monk's last night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) came to tell you that I was waltzing with Burgo
Fitzgerald. You might as well ask me whether I knew why Mr. Bott was
standing at all the doors, glaring at me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know anything about Mr. Bott.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know something about him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) though,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said, again moving herself
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am speaking now of Mrs. Marsham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should speak of them both together as they hunt in couples.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Glencora, will you listen to me, or will you not? If you say that
you will not, I shall know what to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think you would, Plantagenet.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) little
head at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I don't know what you would do.
But I will listen to you. Only, as I said before, it will be very
nice when it's over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Marsham came here, not simply to tell me that you were waltzing
with Mr. Fitzgerald,--and I wish that when you mention his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) name you
would call him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) Mr. Fitzgerald.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You generally prefix his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) Christian name, which it would be much
better that you should omit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will try,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said, very gently; <div class="bookquote">``but it's hard to drop an old
habit. Before you married me you knew that I had learned to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>)
Burgo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not simply to tell me that you were waltzing that Mrs. Marsham
came here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And it was not simply to see me waltzing that Mr. Bott stood in the
doorways, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) followed me about, and came down after me to the
supper-room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Glencora, will you oblige me by not speaking of Mr. Bott?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would oblige me by not speaking of Mrs. Marsham.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Palliser rose quickly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) chair with a gesture of anger, stood
upright for half a minute, and then sat down again. <div class="bookquote">``I beg your
pardon, Plantagenet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I think I know what you want, and
I'll hold my tongue till you bid me speak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Marsham came here because she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) saw that every one in the room
was regarding you with wonder.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora twisted herself about
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) chair, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said nothing. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) saw that you were not only
dancing with Mr. Fitzgerald, but that you were dancing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>),--what
shall I say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word I can't tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Recklessly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! recklessly, was I? What was I reckless of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Reckless of what people might say; reckless of what I might feel
about it; reckless of your own position.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I to speak now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you had better let me go on. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) was right to come
to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's of course. What's the good of having spies, if they
don't run and tell as soon as they see anything, especially
anything--reckless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Glencora, you are determined to make me angry. I am angry now,--very
angry. I have employed no spies. When rumours have reached me, not
from spies, as you choose to call them, but through your dearest
friends and mine--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by rumours from my dearest friends?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind. Let me go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not when you say my dear friends have spread rumours about me.
Tell me who they are. I have no dear friends. Do you mean Alice
Vavasor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It does not signify. But when I was warned that you had better not
go to any house in which you could meet that man, I would not listen
to it. I said that you were my wife, and that as such I could trust
you anywhere, everywhere, with any person. Others might distrust
you, but I would not do so. When I wished you to go to Monkshade,
were there to be any spies there? When I left you last night at Lady
Monk's, do you believe in your heart that I trusted to Mrs. Marsham's
eyes rather than to your own truth? Do you think that I have lived in
fear of Mr. Fitzgerald?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Plantagenet; I do not think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you believe that I have commissioned Mr. Bott to watch your
conduct? Answer me, Glencora.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) paused a moment, thinking what actually was her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) true belief on
that subject. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) does watch me, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That does not answer my question. Do you believe that I have
commissioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) to do so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I do not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it is ignoble in you to talk to me of spies. I have employed
no spies. If it were ever to come to that, that I thought spies
necessary, it would be all over with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something of feeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) voice as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said
this,--something that almost approached to passion which touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
wife's heart. Whether or not spies would be of any avail, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew
that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had in truth done that of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
had never suspected her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had listened to words of love from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
former lover. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had received, and now carried about with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a
letter from this man, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to elope with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
had by no means resolved that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would not do this thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had
been false to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband; and as her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) confidence
in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own spirit rebelled against the deceit which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) herself
was practising.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that I have never made you happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I know that I
never can make you happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), struck by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) altered tone, and saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) whole
manner and demeanour were changed. <div class="bookquote">``I do not understand what you
mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I have never complained. You have not made me
unhappy.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was one of those men to whom this was enough. If his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
wife caused him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) no uneasiness, what more was he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to expect from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?
No doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might have done much more for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might have given
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) an heir. But he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was a just man, and knew that the blank he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had
drawn was his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) misfortune, and not her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fault.

<p/>But now her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heart was loosed and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) spoke out, at first slowly,
but after a while with all the quietness of strong passion. <div class="bookquote">``No,
Plantagenet; I shall never make you happy. You have never loved me,
nor I you. We have never loved each other for a single moment. I have
been wrong to talk to you about spies; I was wrong to go to Lady
Monk's; I have been wrong in everything that I have done; but never
so wrong as when I let them persuade me to be your wife!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Glencora!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me speak now, Plantagenet, It is better that I should tell you
everything; and I will. I will tell you everything;--everything! I do
love Burgo Fitzgerald. I do! I do! I do! How can I help loving him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>)?
Have I not loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) from the first,--before I had seen you? Did you
not know that it was so? I do love Burgo Fitzgerald, and when I went
to Lady Monk's last night, I had almost made up my mind that I must
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) so, and that I must go away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) and hide myself. But
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) came to speak to me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) has asked you to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>), then?''  (<font color='red'><b>the husband</b></font>)</div>said the husband, in whose
bosom the poison was beginning to take effect, thereby showing that
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was neither above nor below humanity.

<p/>Glencora was immediately reminded that though she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) might, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
pleased, tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) own secrets, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) ought not, in accordance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
ideas of honour, tell those of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) lover. <div class="bookquote">``What need is there of
asking, do you think, when people have loved each other as we have
done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wanted to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>), then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would it not have been the best for you? Plantagenet, I do not love
you;--not as women love their husbands when they do love them. But,
before God, my first wish is to free you from the misfortune that

from her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) chair, and coming close to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), took him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) by the coat. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was
startled, and stepped back a pace, but did not speak; and then stood
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) went on.

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was a tall man and she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was short of stature, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) stood over

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Softly, slowly, very gradually, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) were afraid of what he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
was doing, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) waist. <div class="bookquote">``You are wrong in one
thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I do love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) head, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) breast with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) hair as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) did so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do love you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``If you mean that I am not apt at
telling you so, it is true, I know. My mind is running on other
things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``your mind is running on other things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do love you. If you cannot love me, it is a great misfortune
to us both. But we need not therefore be disgraced. As for that other
thing of which you spoke,--of our having, as yet, no child'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and in
saying this he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) somewhat closer with his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) arm--<div class="bookquote">``you allow
yourself to think too much of it;--much more of it than I do. I have
made no complaints on that head, even within my own breast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what your thoughts are, Plantagenet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Believe me that you wrong my thoughts. Of course I have been
anxious, and have, perhaps, shown my anxiety by the struggle I have
made to hide it. I have never told you what is false, Glencora.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; you are not false!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather have you for my wife, childless,--if you will try to
love me,--than any other woman, though another might give me an heir.
Will you try to love me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was silent. At this moment, after the confession that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had
made, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could not bring herself to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would even try. Had
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would have seemed to have accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) forgiveness
too easily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) said, still holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) waist, <div class="bookquote">``that we
had better leave England for a while. I will give up politics for
this season. Should you like to go to Switzerland for the summer, or
perhaps to some of the German baths, and then on to Italy when the
weather is cold enough?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Still she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was silent. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps your friend,
Miss Vavasor, would go with us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was killing her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) goodness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could not speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) yet;
but now, as he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) mentioned Alice's name, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) gently put up her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand and
rested it on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>).

<p/>At that moment there came a knock at the door;--a sharp knock, which
was quickly repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) arm from his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife's waist,
and standing away from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a few yards.




<p/>CHAPTER LIX.

<p/>The Duke of St. Bungay in Search of a Minister.


<p/>It was the butler who had knocked,--showing that the knock was of
more importance than it would have been had it been struck by the
knuckles of the footman in livery. <div class="bookquote">``If you please, sir, the Duke of
St. Bungay is here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Duke of St. Bungay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser, becoming rather red as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
heard the announcement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) grace is in the library. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) bade me tell you that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
particularly wanted to see you; so I told him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) that you were with my
lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite right; tell his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) grace that I will be with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in two minutes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the butler Palliser</b></font>)</div>Then the butler retired, and Mr. Palliser was again alone with his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go now, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and perhaps I shall not see you
again till the evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let me put you out in any way,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no;--you won't put me out. You will be dressing, I suppose, about
nine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not mean as to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``You must not think
more of Italy. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has come to tell you that you are wanted in the
Cabinet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) turned very red. <div class="bookquote">``It may be so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``but though
I am wanted, I need not go. But I must not keep the duke waiting.
Good-bye.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) turned to the door.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) and took hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) went, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was
forced to turn to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) once again. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) managed to get hold of both
his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hands, and pressed them closely, looking up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) face with
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes laden with tears. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) gently, returned the
pressure of the hands, and then left her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),--without kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). It
was not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was minded not to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would have kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
willingly enough had he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) thought that the occasion required it. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
says that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) loves me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora to herself, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) does
not know what love means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was quite aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had behaved to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) with genuine, true
nobility. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was alone and certain of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) solitude, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
took out that letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) pocket, and tearing it into very small
fragments, without reading it, threw the pieces on the fire. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
did so, her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) mind seemed to be fixed, at any rate, to one thing,--that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would think no more of Burgo Fitzgerald as her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) future master. I
think, however, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had arrived at so much certainty as this,
at that moment in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had been parting with Burgo Fitzgerald,
in Lady Monk's dining-room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had had courage enough,--or shall we
rather say sin enough,--to think of going with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>),--to tell herself
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) would do so; to put herself in the way of doing it; nay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
had had enough of both to enable her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) husband that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had
resolved that it would be good for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) to do so. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was neither
bold enough nor wicked enough to do the thing. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had said of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
own idea of destroying herself,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) did not dare to take the plunge.
Therefore, knowing now that it was so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) tore up the letter that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had carried so long, and burnt it in the fire.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had in truth told him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) everything, believing that in doing so she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
was delivering her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) own death-warrant as regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) future position
in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had done this, not hoping thereby for any escape;
not with any purpose as regarded herself, but simply because deceit
had been grievous to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), and had become unendurable as soon as
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) words and manner had in them any feeling of kindness. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
confession had no sooner been made than her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) fault had been forgiven.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) did not love him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), even,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had thought of leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had justified by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) own
words any treatment of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), however harsh, which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might choose
to practise. But the result had been--the immediate result--that
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been more tender to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) than she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had ever remembered him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to
be before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had conquered her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). However cold and
heartless his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) home might be to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), it must be her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) home now. There
could be no further thought of leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had gone out into the
tiltyard and had tilted with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been the victor.

<p/>Mr. Palliser himself had not time for much thought before he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) found
himself closeted with the Duke; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) crossed the hall and went
up the stairs, a thought or two did pass quickly across his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
had confessed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) did not feel quite
sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had been right, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) did feel quite sure that the
thing had been done. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) recognized it for a fact that, as regarded
the past, no more was to be said. There were to be no reproaches,
and there must be some tacit abandoning of Mrs. Marsham's close
attendance. As to Mr. Bott;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) had begun to hate Mr. Bott, and had
felt cruelly ungrateful, when that gentleman endeavoured to whisper a
word into his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ear as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) passed through the doorway into Lady Monk's
dining-room. And he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had offered to go abroad,--to go abroad and
leave his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) politics, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ambition, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) coming honours. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
had persisted in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) offer, even after his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wife had suggested to
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that the Duke of St. Bungay was now in the house with the object
of offering him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that very thing for which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had so longed! As he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
thought of this his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) heart became heavy within him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). Such chances,--so
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) told himself,--do not come twice in a man's way. When returning
from a twelvemonth's residence abroad he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would be nobody in politics.
He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would have lost everything for which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been working all his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
life. But he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) word, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) opened the library door
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was resolute,--he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could be resolute in adhering to
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) promise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Duke,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I have kept you waiting.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And the two
political allies shook each other by the hand.

<p/>The Duke was in a glow of delight. There had been no waiting. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was
only too glad to find his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) friend at home. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been prepared to
wait, even if Mr. Palliser had been out. <div class="bookquote">``And I suppose you guess why
I'm come?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duke</b></font>)</div>said the Duke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather be told than have to guess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser,
smiling for a moment. But the smile quickly passed off his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) pledge to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has resigned at last. What was said in the Lords last night made
it necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should do so, or that Lord Brock should declare
himself able to support him (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) through thick and thin. Of course, I can
tell you everything now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) must have gone, or I must have done so.
You know that I don't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) in the Cabinet. I admire his (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) character
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) genius, but I think him (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) the most dangerous man in England as
a statesman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) has high principles,--the very highest; but they are
so high as to be out of sight to ordinary eyes. They are too exalted
to be of any use for everyday purposes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) is honest as the sun, I'm
sure; but it's just like the sun's honesty,--of a kind which we men
below can't quite understand or appreciate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) has no instinct in
politics, but reaches his (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) conclusions by philosophical deduction.
Now, in politics, I would a deal sooner trust to instinct than to
calculation. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) may probably know how England ought to be
governed three centuries hence better than any man living, but of the
proper way to govern it now, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows less. Brock half likes
him (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) and half fears him (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) likes the support of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) eloquence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>)
likes the power of the man; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) fears his (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) restless activity, and
thoroughly dislikes his (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) philosophy. At any rate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) has left us, and
I am here to ask you to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Duke</b></font>)</div><p/>The Duke, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) concluded his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) speech, was quite contented, and
almost jovial. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was thoroughly satisfied with the new political
arrangement which he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was proposing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) regarded Mr. Palliser as a
steady, practical man of business, luckily young, and therefore with
a deal of work in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), belonging to the race from which English
ministers ought, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opinion, to be taken, and as being, in some
respects, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own pupil. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been the first to declare aloud that
Plantagenet Palliser was the coming Chancellor of the Exchequer; and
it had been long known, though no such declaration had been made
aloud, that the Duke did not sit comfortably in the same Cabinet with
the gentleman who had now resigned. Everything had now gone as the
Duke wished; and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was prepared to celebrate some little ovation
with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) young friend before he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) left the house in Park Lane.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And who goes out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Palliser, putting off the evil
moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) own decision; but before the Duke could answer him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
had reminded himself that under his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) present circumstances he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had no
right to ask such a question. His (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) own decision could not rest upon
that point. <div class="bookquote">``But it does not matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I must
decline the offer you bring me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Decline it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Duke</b></font>)</div>said the Duke, who could not have been more surprised
had his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) friend talked of declining heaven.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear I must.''  (<font color='red'><b>Duke</b></font>)</div>The Duke had now risen from his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) chair, and was
standing, with both his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hands upon the table. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) contentment,
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) joviality, had vanished. His (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) fine round face had become
almost ludicrously long; his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) eyes and mouth were struggling to convey
reproach, and the reproach was almost drowned in vexation. Ever since
Parliament had met he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had been whispering Mr. Palliser's name into
the Prime Minister's ear, and now--. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) could not, and would not,
believe it. <div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Palliser,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You must have got some
false notion into your head. There can be no possible reason why you
should not join us. Finespun himself will support us, at any rate
for a time.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Finespun</b></font>)</div>Mr. Finespun was the gentleman whose retirement from the
ministry the Duke of St. Bungay had now announced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is nothing of that kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser, who perhaps felt
himself quite equal to the duties proposed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), even though Mr.
Finespun should not support him (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It is nothing of that kind;--it is
no fear of that sort that hinders me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, for mercy's sake, what is it? My dear Palliser, I looked upon
you as being as sure in this matter as myself; and I had a right
to do so. You certainly intended to join us a month ago, if the
opportunity offered. You certainly did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true, Duke. I must ask you to listen to me now, and I must
tell you what I would not willingly tell to any man.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>As Mr. Palliser
said this a look of agony came over his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) face. There are men who can
talk easily of all their most inmost matters, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was not such
a man. It went sorely against the grain with him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) to speak of the
sorrow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) home, even to such a friend as the Duke; but it was
essentially necessary to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) should justify himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Duke</b></font>)</div>said the Duke, <div class="bookquote">``I can't understand that there should
be any reason strong enough to make you throw your party over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Duke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have promised to take my wife abroad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duke</b></font>)</div>said the Duke, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) with surprise, but at the
same time with something of returning joviality in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody
thinks of going abroad at this time of the year. Of course, you can
get away for a time when Parliament breaks up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I have promised to go at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, considering your position, you have made a promise which it
behoves you to break. I am sure Lady Glencora will see it in that
light.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not quite understand me, and I am afraid I must trouble you
to listen to matters which, under other circumstances, it would
be impertinent in me to obtrude upon you.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>A certain stiffness of
demeanour, and measured propriety of voice, much at variance with his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
former manner, came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, Palliser, I don't want to interfere for a moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will allow me, Duke. My wife has told me that, this morning,
which makes me feel that absence from England is requisite for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
present comfort. I was with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) when you came, and had just promised
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Palliser, think of it. If this were a small matter, I would
not press you; but a man in your position has public duties. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) owes
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) services to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) country. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has no right to go back, if it be
possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should so do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When a man has given his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) word, it cannot be right that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should go
back from that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not. But a man may be absolved from a promise. Lady
Glencora--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My wife would, of course, absolve me. It is not that. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) happiness
demands it, and it is partly my fault that it is so. I cannot explain
to you more fully why it is that I must give up the great object for
which I have striven with all my strength.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duke</b></font>)</div>said the Duke. <div class="bookquote">``If you are sure that it is imperative--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is imperative.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could give you twenty-four hours, you know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>Mr. Palliser did
not answer at once, and the Duke thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) saw some sign of
hesitation. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose it would not be possible that I should speak
to Lady Glencora?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It could be of no avail, Duke. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would only declare, at the first
word, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would remain in London; but it would not be the less
my duty on that account to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) abroad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; I can't say. Of course, I can't say. Such an opportunity may
not come twice in a man's life. And at your age too! You are throwing
away from you the finest political position that the world can offer
to the ambition of any man. No one at your time of life has had such
a chance within my memory. That a man under thirty should be thought
fit to be Chancellor of the Exchequer, and should refuse it,--because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) wants to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) wife abroad! Palliser, if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) were dying, you
should remain under such an emergency as this. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might go, but you
should remain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Palliser remained silent for a moment or two in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) chair; he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) then
rose and walked towards the window, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">``There are things
worse than death,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) back was turned. His (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) voice was
very low, and there was a tear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) eye as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) spoke them; the words
were indeed whispered, but the Duke heard them, and felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
could not press him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) any more on the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And must this be final?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duke</b></font>)</div>said the Duke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it must. But your visit here has come so quickly on my
resolution to go abroad,--which, in truth, was only made ten minutes
before your name was brought to me,--that I believe I ought to ask
for a portion of those twenty-four hours which you have offered me. A
small portion will be enough. Will you see me, if I come to you this
evening, say at eight? If the House is up in the Lords I will go to
you in St. James's Square.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall be sitting after eight, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I will see you there. And, Duke, I must ask you to think of me
in this matter as a friend should think, and not as though we were
bound together only by party feeling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will,--I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have told you what I shall never whisper to any one else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you know that you are safe with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure of it. And, Duke, I can tell you that the sacrifice to me
will be almost more than I can bear. This thing that you have offered
me to-day is the only thing that I have ever coveted. I have thought
of it and worked for it, have hoped and despaired, have for moments
been vain enough to think that it was within my strength, and have
been wretched for weeks together because I have told myself that it
was utterly beyond me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As to that, neither Brock nor I, nor any of us, have any doubt.
Finespun himself says that you are the man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am much obliged to them. But I say all this simply that you may
understand how imperative is the duty which, as I think, requires me
to refuse the offer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you haven't refused as yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duke</b></font>)</div>said the Duke. <div class="bookquote">``I shall wait at the
House for you, whether they are sitting or not. And endeavour to join
us. Do the best you can. I will say nothing as to that duty of which
you speak; but if it can be made compatible with your public service,
pray--pray let it be done. Remember how much such a one as you owes
to his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) country.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duke</b></font>)</div>Then the Duke went, and Mr. Palliser was alone.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had not been alone before since the revelation which had been made
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife, and the words she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had spoken were still sounding
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) ears. <div class="bookquote">``I do love Burgo Fitzgerald;--I do! I do! I do!''  (<font color='red'><b>a husband</b></font>)</div>They
were not pleasant words for a young husband to hear. Men there are,
no doubt, whose nature would make them more miserable under the
infliction than it had made Plantagenet Palliser. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was calm,
without strong passion, not prone to give to words a stronger
significance than they should bear;--and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was essentially
unsuspicious. Never for a moment had he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thought, even while those
words were hissing in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ears, that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife had betrayed his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
honour. Nevertheless, there was that at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heart, as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) remembered
those words, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) feel that the world was almost too heavy
for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). For the first quarter of an hour after the Duke's departure
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thought more of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife and of Burgo Fitzgerald than he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did of
Lord Brock and Mr. Finespun. But of this he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) was aware,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) had
forgiven his (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) wife; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) had put his (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
after hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) confession,--and that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), mutely, with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes,
had promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would do her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) best for him (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>). Then something
of an idea of love came across his (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) heart, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) acknowledged to
himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) had married without loving or without requiring love.
Much of all this had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) own fault. Indeed, had not the whole
of it come from his (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) own wrong-doing? He (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) acknowledged that it was so.
But now,--now he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) could not bear to part
with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), even if there were no question of public scandal, or of
disgrace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) had been torn inwardly by that assertion that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) loved
another man. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had got at his (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) heart-strings at last. There are men
who may love their wives, though they never can have been in love
before their marriage.

<p/>When the Duke had been gone about an hour, and when, under ordinary
circumstances, it would have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) time to go down to the House,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) hat and walked into the Park. He (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) way across Hyde
Park, and into Kensington Gardens, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) remained for an hour,
walking up and down beneath the elms. The quidnuncs of the town, who
chanced to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>), and who had heard something of the political
movements of the day, thought, no doubt, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) was meditating his (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>)
future ministerial career. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) had not been there long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>)
had resolved that no ministerial career was at present open to him (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``It has been my own fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) house,
<div class="bookquote">``and with God's help I will mend it, if it be possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) was a slow man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) did not go off instantly to the Duke.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) had given himself to eight o'clock, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) took the full time.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) could not go down to the House of Commons because men would make
inquiries of him (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) which he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) would find it difficult to answer. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>)
dined at home, alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) had told his (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) wife that he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) would see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) at
nine, and before that hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) would not go to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) sat alone till
it was time for him (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) to get into his (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) brougham, and thought it all
over. That seat in the Cabinet and Chancellorship of the Exchequer,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) had so infinitely desired, were already done with. There was
no doubt about that. It might have been better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) not to have
married; but now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) was married, and that things had brought
him (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) untowardly to this pass, he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) wife's safety was his (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>)
first duty. <div class="bookquote">``We will go through Switzerland,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``to
Baden, and then we will get on to Florence and to Rome. She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) has seen
nothing of all these things yet, and the new life will make a change
in her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) shall have her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) own friend with her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) went down to
the House of Lords, and saw the Duke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Palliser,''  (<font color='red'><b>Duke</b></font>)</div>said the Duke, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) had listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``of
course I cannot argue it with you any more. I can only say that I am
very sorry;--more sorry than perhaps you will believe. Indeed, it
half breaks my heart.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The Duke's voice was very sad, and it might
almost have been thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) was going to shed a tear. In truth
he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) disliked Mr. Finespun with the strongest political feeling of which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) was capable, and had attached himself to Mr. Palliser almost as
strongly. It was a thousand pities! How hard had he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) not worked to
bring about this arrangement, which was now to be upset because a
woman had been foolish! <div class="bookquote">``I never above half liked her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Duke</b></font>)</div>said the Duke
to himself, thinking perhaps a little of the Duchess's complaints
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I must go to Brock at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said aloud, <div class="bookquote">``and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>).
God knows what we must do now. Goodbye! good-bye! No; I'm not angry.
There shall be no quarrel. But I am very sorry.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>In this way the two
politicians parted.

<p/>We may as well follow this political movement to its end. The Duke
saw Lord Brock that night, and then those two ministers sent for
another minister,--another noble Lord, a man of great experience
in Cabinets. These three discussed the matter together, and on the
following day Lord Brock got up in the House, and made a strong
speech in defence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) colleague, Mr. Finespun. To the end of the
Session, at any rate, Mr. Finespun kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) position, and held the
seals of the Exchequer while all the quidnuncs of the nation, shaking
their heads, spoke of the wonderful power of Mr. Finespun, and
declared that Lord Brock did not dare to face the Opposition without
him (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>).

<p/>In the meantime Mr. Palliser had returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) resolution with reference to their tour abroad. <div class="bookquote">``We may as well
make up our minds to start at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``At any rate, there is
nothing on my side to hinder us.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LX.

<p/>Alice Vavasor's Name Gets into the Money Market.


<p/>Some ten or twelve days after George Vavasor's return to London from
Westmoreland he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) appeared at Mr. Scruby's offices with four small
slips of paper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) hand. Mr. Scruby, as usual, was pressing for
money. The third election was coming on, and money was already being
spent very freely among the men of the River Bank. So, at least, Mr.
Scruby declared. Mr. Grimes, of the <div class="bookquote">``Handsome Man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimes/Grimes</b></font>)</div>had shown signs
of returning allegiance. But Mr. Grimes could not afford to be loyal
without money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) little family to protect. Mr. Scruby,
too, had his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) little family, and was not ashamed to use it on this
occasion. <div class="bookquote">``I'm a family man, Mr. Vavasor, and therefore I never run
any risks. I never go a yard further than I can see my way back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) had said in answer to a proposition that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) should take
George's note of hand for the expenses of the next election, payable
in three months' time. <div class="bookquote">``It is so very hard to realize,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George,
<div class="bookquote">``immediately upon a death, when all the property left is real
property.''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very hard indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Scruby, who had heard with
accuracy all the particulars of the old Squire's will. Vavasor
understood the lawyer, cursed him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) inwardly, and suggested to himself
that some day he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) might murder Mr. Scruby as well as John Grey,--and
perhaps also a few more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) enemies. Two days after the interview
in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) own note of hand had been refused, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) again called in
Great Marlborough Street. Upon this occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) tendered to Mr. Scruby
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) approval the four slips of paper which have been mentioned.
Mr. Scruby regarded them with attention, looking first at one side
horizontally, and then at the other side perpendicularly. But before
we learn the judgement pronounced by Mr. Scruby as to these four slips
of paper, we must go back to their earlier history. As they were
still in their infancy, we shall not have to go back far.

<p/>One morning, at about eleven o'clock the parlour-maid came up to
Alice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat alone in the drawing-room in Queen Anne Street, and
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) there was a <div class="bookquote">``gentleman''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne Street/Queen Anne Street</b></font>)</div>in the hall waiting to be seen by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>). We all know the tone in which servants announce a gentleman when
they know that the gentleman is not a gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A gentleman wanting to see me! What sort of a gentleman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, miss, I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s just of our sort; but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s decent to
look at.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice Vavasor had no desire to deny herself to any person but one.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was well aware that the gentleman in the hall could not be her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
cousin George, and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) did not refuse to see him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) come up,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But I think, Jane, you ought to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) name.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Jane/Jane</b></font>)</div>Jane did ask him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) name, and came back immediately,
announcing Mr. Levy.

<p/>This occurred immediately after the return of Mr. John Vavasor from
Westmoreland. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had reached home late on the preceding evening, and
at the moment of Mr. Levy's call was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levy</b></font>) dressing-room.

<p/>Alice got up to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) visitor, and at once understood the tone
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) maid's voice. Mr. Levy was certainly not a gentleman of the
sort to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been most accustomed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Levy</b></font>) was a little dark man,
with sharp eyes, set very near to each other in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levy</b></font>) head, with a
beaked nose, thick at the bridge, and a black moustache, but no other
beard. Alice did not at all like the look of Mr. Levy, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) stood
up to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Levy</b></font>), made him (<font color='blue'><b>Levy</b></font>) a little bow, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Levy</b></font>) to sit down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is papa dressed yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice asked the servant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, miss, I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is,--not to say dressed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice had thought it might be as well that Mr. Levy should know that
there was a gentleman in the house with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've called about a little bit of business, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Levy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Levy,
when they were alone. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing as you need disturb yourself about.
You'll find it all square, I think.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Levy</b></font>) took a case out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levy</b></font>)
breast-pocket, and produced a note, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levy</b></font>) handed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). Alice
took the note, and saw immediately that it was addressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin George. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. George Vavasor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Levy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Levy. <div class="bookquote">``I dare
say you never saw me before, miss?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir; I think not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am your cousin's clerk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you're Mr. Vavasor's clerk. I'll read his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) letter, if you please,
sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>George Vavasor's letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levy</b></font>) cousin was as follows:--


<p/>DEAR ALICE,

<p/>After what passed between us when I last saw you I thought
that on my return from Westmoreland I should learn that
you had paid in at my bankers' the money that I require.
But I find that this is not so; and of course I excuse
you, because women so seldom know when or how to do that
which business demands of them. You have, no doubt, heard
the injustice which my grandfather has done me, and will
probably feel as indignant as I do. I only mention this
now, because the nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) will makes it more than
ever incumbent on you that you should be true to your
pledge to me.

<p/>Till there shall be some ground for a better understanding
between us,--and this I do not doubt will come,--I think
it wiser not to call, myself, at Queen Anne Street. I
therefore send my confidential clerk with four bills, each
of five hundred pounds, drawn at fourteen days' date,
across which I will get you to write your name. Mr. Levy
will show you the way in which this should be done. Your
name must come under the word <div class="bookquote">``accepted,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and just above
the name of Messrs. Drummonds, where the money must be
lying ready, at any rate, not later than Monday fortnight.
Indeed, the money must be there some time on the Saturday.
They know you so well at Drummonds' that you will not
object to call on the Saturday afternoon, and ask if it is
all right.

<p/>I have certainly been inconvenienced by not finding the
money as I expected on my return to town. If these bills
are not properly provided for, the result will be very
disastrous to me. I feel, however, sure that this will be
done, both for your own sake and for mine.

<p/>Affectionately yours,

<p/>GEORGE VAVASOR.


<p/>The unparalleled impudence of this letter had the effect which the
writer had intended. It made Alice think immediately of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own
remissness,--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been remiss,--rather than of the enormity of
his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) claim upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). The decision with which he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) asked for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) money,
without any pretence at an excuse on his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) part, did for the time
induce her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had no alternative but to give it to
him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been wrong in delaying it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>)
that he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) should have it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ought to have been as good as her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
word. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should not have forced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) the necessity of demanding
it.

<p/>But the idea of signing four bills was terrible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt
sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ought not to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) name to orders for so large an
amount and then intrust them to such a man as Mr. Levy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father
was in the house, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might have asked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). The thought that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would do so of course occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). But then it occurred to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) also that were she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father as to this advancing
of money to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin,--to this giving of money, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) now well
understood that it would be a gift;--were she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to consult her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father
in any way about it, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), not only from signing the
bills for Mr. Levy, but, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levy</b></font>) could do so, from keeping the
promise made to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was resolved that George should have
the money, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could give it to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
father. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father might probably be able to delay the gift, and
thus rob it of its chief value. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) were to sign the bills, the
money must be made to be forthcoming. So much she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) understood.

<p/>Mr. Levy had taken out the four bills from the same case, and had
placed them on the table before him (<font color='blue'><b>Levy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Vavasor has explained, I
believe, miss, what it is you have to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levy</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir; my cousin has explained.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And there is nothing else to trouble you with, I believe. If you
will just write your name across them, here, I need not detain you by
staying any longer.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Levy</b></font>)</div>Mr. Levy was very anxious to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Levy</b></font>) visit as
short as possible, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Levy</b></font>) had heard that Mr. John Vavasor was in the
house.

<p/>But Alice hesitated. Two thousand pounds is a very serious sum of
money. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had heard much of sharpers, and thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ought to
be cautious. What if this man, of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had never before heard,
should steal the bills after she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had signed them? She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked again at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin's letter, chiefly with the object of gaining time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all right, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Levy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Levy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Could you not leave them with me, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; not very well, miss. No doubt Mr. Vavasor has explained it all;
but the fact is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) must have them this afternoon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) has got a heavy
sum to put down on the nail about this here election, and if it ain't
down to-day, them on whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) has to depend will be all abroad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, sir, the money will not be payable to-day. If I understand it,
they are not cheques.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, miss, no; they are not cheques. But your name, miss, at fourteen
days, is the same as ready money;--just the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) paused, and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) paused, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levy</b></font>) reached a pen for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) from the
writing-table, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) signed the four bills as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levy</b></font>) held them
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was quick enough at doing this when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had once
commenced the work. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) object, then, was that the man should be gone
from the house before her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father could meet him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/>These were the four bits of paper which George Vavasor tendered to Mr.
Scruby's notice on the occasion which we have now in hand. In doing
so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) made use of them after the manner of a grand capitalist, who
knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) may assume certain airs as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) allows the odours of the
sweetness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) wealth to drop from him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You insisted on ready money, with your d-- suspicions,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>);
<div class="bookquote">``and there it is. You're not afraid of fourteen days, I dare say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fourteen days is neither here nor there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Scruby. <div class="bookquote">``We can
let our payments stand over as long as that, without doing any harm.
I'll send one of my men down to Grimes, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) I can't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>),
till,--let me see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) looked at one of the bills, <div class="bookquote">``till the
15th.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But this was not exactly what George Vavasor wanted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was desirous
that the bills should be immediately turned into money, so that the
necessity of forcing payments from Alice, should due provision for
the bills not be made, might fall into other hands than his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can wait till the 15th,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>said Scruby, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) handed the bits of
paper back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) customer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will want a thousand, you say?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A thousand to begin with. Certainly not less.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you had better keep two of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--no! I don't see the use of that. You had better collect them
through your own banker, and let me have a cheque on the 15th or
16th.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How cursed suspicious you are, Scruby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I ain't. I'm not a bit suspicious. I don't deal in such
articles; that's all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What doubt can there be about such bills as those? Everybody knows
that my cousin has a considerable fortune, altogether at her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) own
disposal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The truth is, Mr. Vavasor, that bills with ladies' names on
them,--ladies who are no way connected with business,--ain't just the
paper that people like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing on earth can be surer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You take them into the City for discount, and see if the bankers
don't tell you the same. They may be done, of course, upon your name.
I say nothing about that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can explain to you the nature of the family arrangement, but I
can't do that to a stranger. However, I don't mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not. The time is so short that it does not signify. Have
them collected through your own bankers, and then, if it don't suit
you to call, send me a cheque for a thousand pounds when the time
is up.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>Then Mr. Scruby turned to some papers on his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) right hand, as
though the interview had been long enough. Vavasor looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>)
angrily, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) wound at him (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) and cursing him (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) inwardly. Mr. Scruby
went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) paper, by no means regarding either the wound or the
unspoken curses. Thereupon Vavasor got up and went away without any
word of farewell.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) walked along Great Marlborough Street, and through those
unalluring streets which surround the Soho district, and so on to
the Strand and his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) own lodgings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) still continued to think of some
wide scheme of revenge,--of some scheme in which Mr. Scruby might be
included. There had appeared something latterly in Mr. Scruby's manner
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>), something of mingled impatience and familiarity, which made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) had fallen in the attorney's estimation. It was not
that the lawyer thought him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) to be less honourable, or less clever,
than he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had before thought him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>); but that the man was like a rat,
and knew a falling house by the instinct that was in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). So George
Vavasor cursed Mr. Scruby, and calculated some method of murdering him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
without detection.

<p/>The reader is not to suppose that the Member for the Chelsea
Districts had, in truth, resolved to gratify his (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) revenge by
murder,--by murdering any of those persons whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) hated so
vigorously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) did not, himself, think it probable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) would
become a murderer. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) received some secret satisfaction in
allowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) mind to dwell upon the subject, and in making those
calculations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) reflected that it would not do to take off Scruby
and John Grey at the same time, as it would be known that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) was
connected with both of them; unless, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) was to take off a
third person at the same time,--a third person, as to the expediency
of ending whose career he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) calculations quite as often as he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>)
did in regard to any of those persons whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) cursed so often. It
need hardly be explained to the reader that this third person was the
sitting Member for the Chelsea Districts.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) was himself in want of instant ready money Mr. Scruby's
proposition that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) should leave the four bills at his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) own bankers',
to be collected when they came to maturity, did not suit him (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>)
doubted much, also, whether at the end of the fourteen days the
money would be forthcoming. Alice would be driven to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father,
in order that the money might be procured, and John Vavasor would
probably succeed in putting impediments in the way of the payment.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) must take the bills into the City, and do the best there that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
could with them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was too late for this to-day, and therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) lodgings, and then down to the House. In the House he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
sat all the night with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) hat over his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) eyes, making those little
calculations of which I have spoken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have heard the news; haven't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bott to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>),
whispering in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``News; no. I haven't heard any news.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Finespun has resigned, and Palliser is at this moment with the Duke
of St. Bungay in the Lords' library.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They may both be at the bottom of the Lords' fishpond, for what I
care,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's nonsense, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>said Bott. <div class="bookquote">``Still, you know Palliser is
Chancellor of the Exchequer at this moment. What a lucky fellow you
are to have such a chance come to you directly you get in. As soon as
he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) takes his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) seat down there, of course we shall go up behind him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall have another election in a month's time,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``I'm
safe enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bott/Bott</b></font>)</div>said Bott. <div class="bookquote">``It never hurts a man at elections to be
closely connected with the Government.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>George Vavasor was in the City by times the next morning, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
found that the City did not look with favourable eyes on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) four
bills. The City took them up, first horizontally, and then, with
a twist of its hand, perpendicularly, and looked at them with
distrustful eyes. The City repeated the name, Alice Vavasor, as
though it were not esteemed a good name on Change. The City suggested
that as the time was so short, the holder of the bills would be wise
to hold them till he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) could collect the amount. It was very clear that
the City suspected something wrong in the transaction. The City, by
one of its mouths, asserted plainly that ladies' bills never meant
business. George Vavasor cursed the City, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) calculation
about murdering it. Might not a river of strychnine be turned on
round the Exchange about luncheon time? Three of the bills he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) left
at last with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) own bankers for collection, and retained the fourth
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) breast-pocket, intending on the morrow to descend with it
into those lower depths of the money market which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had not as yet
visited. Again, on the next day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) went to work and succeeded to
some extent. Among those lower depths he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) found a capitalist who was
willing to advance him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) two hundred pounds, keeping that fourth bill
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) possession as security. The capitalist was to have forty
pounds for the transaction, and George cursed him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
cheque. George Vavasor knew quite enough of the commercial world to
enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) to understand that a man must be in a very bad condition
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) consents to pay forty pounds for the use of two hundred for
fourteen days. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) cursed the City. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) cursed the House of Commons. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
cursed his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) cousin Alice and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) sister Kate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) cursed the memory of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) grandfather. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) cursed himself.

<p/>Mr. Levy had hardly left the house in Queen Anne Street, before
Alice had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father what she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had done. <div class="bookquote">``The money must be
forthcoming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. To this her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father made no immediate reply,
but turning himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chair away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) with a sudden start,
sat looking at the fire and shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``The money must be made
to be forthcoming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``Papa, will you see that it is done?''
 (<font color='red'><b>John Vavasor/Mr. John Vavasor/Mr. Vavasor</b></font>)</div>This was very hard upon poor John Vavasor, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) felt it to
be. <div class="bookquote">``Papa, if you will not promise, I must go to Mr. Round about it
myself, and must find out a broker to sell out for me. You would not
wish that my name should be dishonoured.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will be ruined,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and for such a rascal as that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind whether he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) is a rascal or not, papa. You must acknowledge
that he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) has been treated harshly by his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) grandfather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think that will was the wisest thing my father ever did. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
left the estate to George, there wouldn't have been an acre of it
left in the family in six months' time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the life interest, papa!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) would have raised all he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) could upon that, and it would have done
him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) no good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate, papa, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) must have this two thousand pounds. You must
promise me that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) will want more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I do not think he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) will ask for more. At any rate, I do not think
that I am bound to give him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) all that I have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think not. I should like to know how you can be bound to
give him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I promised it. I have signed the bills now, and it must be
done.''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Still Mr. Vavasor made no promise. <div class="bookquote">``Papa, if you will not say
that you will do it, I must go down to Mr. Round at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that I can do it. I don't know that Mr. Round can do
it. Your money is chiefly on mortgage.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then there was a pause for
a moment in the conversation. <div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, I never heard of such
a thing in my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vavasor; <div class="bookquote">``I never did. Four thousand
pounds given away to such a man as that, in three months! Four
thousand pounds! And you say you do not intend to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not; all that is over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) know that it is over?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You suppose so! Things of that sort are so often over with you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This was very cruel. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had deserved the reproach, but still
it was very cruel. The blow struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) with such force that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
staggered under it. Tears came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could hardly
speak lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should betray herself by sobbing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that I have behaved badly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said at last; <div class="bookquote">``but I am
punished, and you might spare me now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't want to punish you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) said, getting up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) chair and
walking about the room. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to punish you. But, I don't
want to see you ruined!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go to Mr. Round then, myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Vavasor went on walking about the room, jingling the money in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) trousers-pockets, and pushing the chairs about as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) chanced to
meet them. At last, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) made a compromise with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would take a
day to think whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in getting the money, and
communicate his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) decision to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) on the following morning.




<p/>CHAPTER LXI.

<p/>The Bills Are Made All Right.


<p/>Mr. Vavasor was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) wits' end about his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) daughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had put her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
name to four bills for five hundred pounds each, and had demanded
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>), almost without an apology, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) aid in obtaining money to
meet them. And she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) might put her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) name to any other number of bills,
and for any amount! There was no knowing how a man ought to behave
to such a daughter. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) money,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>the father said to
himself; <div class="bookquote">``and if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had got none of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) own, I would make her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) as
comfortable as I could with my own income. But to see her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) throw her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
money away in such a fashion as this is enough to break a man's
heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Vavasor went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) office in Chancery Lane, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) did not go to
the chambers of Mr. Round, the lawyer. Instead of calling on Mr. Round
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) sent a note by a messenger to Suffolk Street, and the answer to
the note came in the person of Mr. Grey. John Grey was living in town
in these days, and was in the habit of seeing Mr. Vavasor frequently.
Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had not left London since the memorable occasion on which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had pitched his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) rival down the tailor's stairs at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) lodgings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
had made himself pretty well conversant with George Vavasor's career,
and had often shuddered as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) thought what might be the fate of any
girl who might trust herself to marry such a man as that.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been at home when Mr. Vavasor's note had reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) lodgings,
and had instantly walked off towards Chancery Lane. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) way
to Mr. Vavasor's signing-office very accurately, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had acquired
a habit of calling there, and of talking to the father about his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
daughter. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a patient, persevering man, confident in himself,
and apt to trust that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would accomplish those things which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
attempted, though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was hardly himself aware of any such aptitude.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had never despaired as to Alice. And though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had openly
acknowledged to himself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been very foolish,--or rather,
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) judgement had failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had never in truth been
angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had looked upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) rejection of himself, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) subsequent promise to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin, as the effects of a mental
hallucination, very much to be lamented,--to be wept for, perhaps,
through a whole life, as a source of terrible sorrow to himself
and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) regarded it all as a disease, of which the cure
was yet possible,--as a disease which, though it might never leave
the patient as strong as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was before, might still leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
altogether. And as he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) would still have clung to his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) love had she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) been
attacked by any of those illnesses for which doctors have well-known
names, so would he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) cling to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was attacked by a malady
for which no name was known. He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) had already heard from Mr. Vavasor
that Alice had discovered how impossible it was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin, and, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) quiet, patient, enduring way, was beginning
to feel confident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would, at last, carry his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) mistress off with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) to Nethercoats.

<p/>It was certainly a melancholy place, that signing-office, in which
Mr. John Vavasor was doomed to spend twelve hours a week, during every
term time, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) existence. Whether any man could really pass an
existence of work in such a workshop, and not have gone mad,--could
have endured to work there for seven hours a day, every week-day of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) life, I am not prepared to say. I doubt much whether any victims
are so doomed. I have so often wandered through those gloomy passages
without finding a sign of humanity there,--without hearing any
slightest tick of the hammer of labour, that I am disposed to think
that Lord Chancellors have been anxious to save their subordinates
from suicide, and have mercifully decreed that the whole staff of
labourers, down to the very message boys of the office, should be
sent away to green fields or palatial clubs during, at any rate, a
moiety of their existence.

<p/>The dismal set of chambers, in which the most dismal room had been
assigned to Mr. Vavasor, was not actually in Chancery Lane. Opening
off from Chancery Lane are various other small lanes, quiet, dingy
nooks, some of them in the guise of streets going no whither,
some being thoroughfares to other dingy streets beyond, in which
sponging-houses abound, and others existing as the entrances to
so-called Inns of Court,--inns of which all knowledge has for years
been lost to the outer world of the laity, and, as I believe, lost
almost equally to the inner world of the legal profession. Who has
ever heard of Symonds' Inn? But an ancestral Symonds, celebrated, no
doubt, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Symonds</b></font>) time, did found an inn, and there it is to this day. Of
Staples' Inn, who knows the purposes or use? Who are its members, and
what do they do as such? And Staples' Inn is an inn with pretensions,
having a chapel of its own, or, at any rate, a building which, in
its external dimensions, is ecclesiastical, having a garden and
architectural proportions; and a façade towards Holborn, somewhat
dingy, but respectable, with an old gateway, and with a decided
character of its own.

<p/>The building in which Mr. John Vavasor had a room and a desk was
located in one of these side streets, and had, in its infantine days,
been regarded with complacency by its founder. It was stone-faced,
and strong, and though very ugly, had about it that air of importance
which justifies a building in assuming a special name of itself. This
building was called the Accountant-General's Record Office, and very
probably, in the gloom of its dark cellars, may lie to this day the
records of the expenditure of many a fair property which has gotten
itself into Chancery, and has never gotten itself out again. It was
entered by a dark hall, the door of which was never closed; and
which, having another door at its further end leading into another
lane, had become itself a thoroughfare. But the passers through it
were few in number. Now and then a boy might be seen there carrying
on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head or shoulders a huge mass of papers which you would
presume to be accounts, or some clerk employed in the purlieus of
Chancery Lane who would know the shortest possible way from the
chambers of some one attorney to those of some other. But this hall,
though open at both ends, was as dark as Erebus; and any who lingered
in it would soon find themselves to be growing damp, and would smell
mildew, and would become naturally affected by the exhalations
arising from those Chancery records beneath their feet.

<p/>Up the stone stairs, from this hall, John Grey passed to Mr. Vavasor's
signing-room. The stairs were broad, and almost of noble proportions,
but the darkness and gloom which hung about the hall, hung also about
them,--a melancholy set of stairs, up and down which no man can walk
with cheerful feet. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came upon a long, broad passage, in which
no sound was, at first, to be heard. There was no busy noise of doors
slamming, no rapid sound of shoes, no passing to and fro of men
intent on their daily bread. Pausing for a moment, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might
look round about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and realize the deathlike stillness of the
whole, John Grey could just distinguish the heavy breathing of a man,
thereby learning that there was a captive in, at any rate, one of
those prisons on each side of him (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>). As he (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>) drew near to the door of Mr.
Vavasor's chamber he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) knew that the breathing came from thence.

<p/>On the door there were words inscribed, which were just legible in
the gloom--<div class="bookquote">``Signing Room. Mr. Vavasor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John Vavasor/Mr. John Vavasor/Mr. Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>How John Vavasor did hate those words! It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) that they
had been placed there with the express object of declaring his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
degradation aloud to the world. Since his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) grandfather's will had
been read to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had almost made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) mind to go down those
melancholy stairs for the last time, to shake the dust off his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) feet
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) left the Accountant-General's Record Office for ever, and
content himself with half his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) official income. But how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) give
up so many hundreds a year while his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) daughter was persisting in
throwing away thousands as fast as, or faster than, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could lay her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
hands on them?

<p/>John Grey entered the room and found Mr. Vavasor sitting all alone in
an arm-chair over the fire. I rather think that that breathing had
been the breathing of a man asleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was resting himself amidst the
labours of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) signing. It was a large, dull room, which could not
have been painted, I should think, within the memory of man, looking
out backwards into some court. The black wall of another building
seemed to stand up close to the window,--so close that no direct ray
of the sun ever interrupted the signing-clerk at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work. In the
middle of the room there was a large mahogany-table, on which lay a
pile of huge papers. Across the top of them there was placed a bit
of blotting-paper, with a quill pen, the two only tools which were
necessary to the performance of the signing-clerk's work. On the
table there stood a row of official books, placed lengthways on
their edges: the <div class="bookquote">``Post-Office Directory,''  (<font color='red'><b>Parliament</b></font>)</div>the <div class="bookquote">``Court Circular,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Parliament</b></font>)</div>a <div class="bookquote">``Directory to the Inns of Court,''  (<font color='red'><b>Parliament</b></font>)</div>a dusty volume of Acts of
Parliament, which had reference to Chancery accounts,--a volume which
Mr. Vavasor never opened; and there were some others; but there was
no book there in which any Christian man or woman could take delight,
either for amusement or for recreation. There were three or four
chairs round the wall, and there was the one arm-chair which the
occupant of the chamber had dragged away from its sacred place to the
hearth-rug. There was also an old Turkey carpet on the floor. Other
furniture there was none. Can it be a matter of surprise to any one
that Mr. Vavasor preferred his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) club to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) place of business? He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was
not left quite alone in this deathlike dungeon. Attached to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) own
large room there was a small closet, in which sat the signing-clerk's
clerk,--a lad of perhaps seventeen years of age, who spent the
greatest part of his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) time playing tit-tat-to by himself upon official
blotting-paper. Had I been Mr. Vavasor I should have sworn a bosom
friendship with that lad, have told him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) all my secrets, and joined
his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) youthful games.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Mr. Vavasor had cried when John Grey disturbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) slumber
by knocking at the door. <div class="bookquote">``I'm glad to see you,--very. Sit down; won't
you? Did you ever see such a wretched fire? The coals they give you
in this place are the worst in all London. Did you ever see such
coals?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) gave a wicked poke at the fire.

<p/>It was now the 1st of May, and Grey, who had walked from Suffolk
Street, was quite warm. <div class="bookquote">``One hardly wants a fire at all, such weather
as this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh; don't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the signing-clerk. <div class="bookquote">``If you had to sit here all
day, you'd see if you didn't want a fire. It's the coldest building I
ever put my foot in. Sometimes in winter I have to sit here the whole
day in a great-coat. I only wish I could shut old Sugden up here for
a week or two, after Christmas.''  (<font color='red'><b>The lawyer</b></font>)</div>The great lawyer whom he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had named
was the man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) supposed to have inflicted on him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) the terrible
injury of his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) life, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was continually invoking small misfortunes
on the head of that tyrant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is Alice?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey, desiring to turn the subject from the
ten-times-told tale of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) friend's wrongs.

<p/>Mr. Vavasor sighed. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is well enough, I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is anything the matter in Queen Anne Street?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll hardly believe it when I tell you; and, indeed, I hardly know
whether I ought to tell you or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As you and I have gone so far together, I think that you ought to
tell me anything that concerns her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) nearly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just it. It's about her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) money. Do you know, Grey, I'm
beginning to think that I've been wrong in allowing you to advance
what you have done on her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) account?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why wrong?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I foresee there'll be a difficulty about it. How are we to
manage about the repayment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) becomes my wife there will be no management wanted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how if she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) never becomes your wife? I'm beginning to think
she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)'ll never do anything like any other woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not quite sure that you understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey; <div class="bookquote">``though of
course you ought to do so better than any one else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody can understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the angry father. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) told me the
other day, as you know, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) was going to have nothing more to do
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) cousin--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)--has she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) become friends with him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) again?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
asked the question there came a red spot on each cheek, showing the
strong mental anxiety which had prompted it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I believe not;--that is, certainly not in the way you mean. I
think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) is beginning to know that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is a rascal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a great blessing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) has learned the truth before it was
too late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But would you believe it;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) has given him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) name to bills for
two thousand pounds, payable at two weeks' sight? He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) sent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) only
this morning a fellow that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) called his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) clerk, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) has been fool
enough to accept them. Two thousand pounds! That comes of leaving
money at a young woman's own disposal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we expected that, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey, who seemed to take the
news with much composure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Expected it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course we did. You yourself did not suppose that what he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had
before would have been the last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But after she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had quarrelled with him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would make no difference with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had promised him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
money, and as it seems that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) will be content with that, let her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
keep her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And give him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) everything! Not if I can help it. I'll expose him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). I
will indeed. Such a pitiful rascal as he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will do nothing, Mr. Vavasor, that will injure your daughter. I'm
very sure of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, by heavens--. Such sheer robbery as that! Two thousand pounds
more in fourteen days!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>The shortness of the date at which the bills
were drawn seemed to afflict Mr. Vavasor almost as keenly as the
amount. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) described the whole transaction as accurately as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
could do so, and also told how Alice had declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) purpose of
going to Mr. Round the lawyer, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father would not undertake to
procure the money for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) by the time the bills should become due.
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Round, you know, has heard nothing about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Round</b></font>)
doesn't dream of any such thing. If she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would take my advice, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
would leave the bills, and let them be dishonoured. As it is, I think
I shall call at Drummonds', and explain the whole transaction.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey. <div class="bookquote">``I will call at Drummonds',
instead, and see that the money is all right for the bills. As far as
they go, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Round</b></font>) have his (<font color='blue'><b>Round</b></font>) plunder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) won't take you, at last, Grey? Upon my word, I don't
think she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) ever will. My belief is she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'ll never get married. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'ll
never do anything like any other woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The money won't be missed by me if I never get married,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey,
with a smile. <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) does marry me, of course I shall make her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) pay
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, by George! that won't do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor. <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) were your
daughter you'd know that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could not take a man's money in that
way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I know it now, though she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is not my daughter. I was only joking.
As soon as I am certain,--finally certain,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) can never become
my wife, I will take back my money. You need not be afraid. The
nature of the arrangement we have made shall then be explained to
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In this way it was settled; and on the following morning the father
informed the daughter that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had done her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) bidding, and that the
money would be placed to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) credit at the bankers' before the bills
came due. On that Saturday, the day which her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) cousin had named in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
letter, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) trudged down to Drummonds', and was informed by a very
courteous senior clerk in that establishment, that due preparation
for the bills had been made.

<p/>So far, I think we may say that Mr. George Vavasor was not
unfortunate.




<p/>CHAPTER LXII.

<p/>Going Abroad.


<p/>One morning, early in May, a full week before Alice's visit to the
bankers' at Charing Cross, a servant in grand livery, six feet high,
got out of a cab at the door in Queen Anne Street, and sent up a
note for Miss Vavasor, declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) would wait in the cab for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had come from Lady Glencora, and had been specially
ordered to go in a cab and come back in a cab, and make himself as
like a Mercury, with wings to his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) feet, as may be possible to a
London footman. Mr. Palliser had arranged his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) plans with his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife that
morning,--or, I should more correctly say, had given her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) orders,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), in consequence, had sent away her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) Mercury in hot pressing
haste to Queen Anne Street. <div class="bookquote">``Do come;--instantly if you can,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the
note said. <div class="bookquote">``I have so much to tell you, and so much to ask of you. If
you can't come, when shall I find you, and where?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice sent back a
note, saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would be in Park Lane as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could put
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) bonnet and walk down; and then the Mercury went home in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
cab.

<p/>Alice found her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) friend in the small breakfast-room up-stairs, sitting
close by the window. They had not as yet met since the evening of
Lady Monk's party, nor had Lady Glencora seen Alice in the mourning
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) now wore for her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) grandfather. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, what a change it
makes in you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I never thought of your being in black.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what it is you want, but shan't I do in mourning as
well as I would in colours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll do in anything, dear. But I have so much to tell you, and I

afraid you won't do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You generally find me very complaisant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No I don't, dear. It is very seldom you will do anything for me.
But I must tell you everything first. Do take your bonnet off, for
I shall be hours in doing it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hours in telling me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and in getting your consent to what I want you to do. But I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is to take you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you may well ask that. If you could know what questions I have
asked myself on that head! I sometimes say things to myself as though
they were the most proper and reasonable things in the world, and
then within an hour or two I hate myself for having thought of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why don't you answer me? Who is going abroad with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; you. When I have named so very respectable a chaperon for my
youth, of course you will understand that my husband is to take us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Mr. Palliser can't leave London at this time of the year?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) is to leave London at this time of the year.
Don't look in that way, for it's all settled. Whether you go with
me or not, I've got to go. To-day is Tuesday. We are to be off next
Tuesday night, if you can make yourself ready. We shall breakfast in
Paris on Wednesday morning, and then it will be to us all just as if
we were in a new world. Mr. Palliser will walk up and down the new
court of the Louvre, and you will be on his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) left arm, and I shall be
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) right,--just like English people,--and it will be the most
proper thing that ever was seen in life. Then we shall go on to
Basle'' (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>--Alice shuddered as Basle was mentioned, thinking of the
balcony over the river--``and so to Lucerne--. But no; that was the
first plan, and Mr. Palliser altered it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) spent a whole day up
here with maps and Bradshaw's and Murray's guide-books, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Murray</b></font>)
scolded me so because I didn't care whether we went first to Baden
or to some other place. How could I care? I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Murray</b></font>) I would go
anywhere he (<font color='blue'><b>Murray</b></font>) chose to take me. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Murray</b></font>) told me I was heartless;--and
I acknowledged that I was heartless. ``I am heartless,'' I said. <div class="bookquote">``Tell

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't choose to contradict my husband. Besides, it's true. Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) threw the Bradshaw away, and all the maps flew about. So I picked
them up again, and said we'd go to Switzerland first. I knew that
would settle it, and of course he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) decided on stopping at Baden. If he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
had said Jericho, it would have been the same thing to me. Wouldn't
you like to go to Jericho?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have no special objection to Jericho.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are to go to Baden instead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've said nothing about that yet. But you have not told me half your
story. Why is Mr. Palliser going abroad in the middle of Parliament in
this way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah; now I must go back to the beginning. And indeed, Alice, I hardly
know how to tell you; not that I mind you knowing it, only there are
some things that won't get themselves told. You can hardly guess what
it is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) is giving up. You must swear that you won't repeat what
I'm going to tell you now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a woman you are for discretion! it is you that ought to be
Chancellor of the Exchequer; you are so wise. Only you haven't
brought your own pigs to the best market, after all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do mind them, very much. But the secret is this. They have asked
Mr. Palliser to be Chancellor of the Exchequer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) has--refused.
Think of that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because of me,--of me, and my folly, and wickedness, and
abominations. Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) has been fool enough to plague himself with
a wife--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) who of all men ought to have kept himself free from such
troubles. Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) has been so good! It is almost impossible to make
any one understand it. If you could know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) has longed for this
office;--how he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) has worked for it day and night, wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) eyes out
with figures when everybody else has been asleep, shutting himself up
with such creatures as Mr. Bott when other men have been shooting and
hunting and flirting and spending their money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) has been a slave to
it for years,--all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) life I believe,--in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) might sit
in the Cabinet, and be a minister and a Chancellor of the Exchequer.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) has hoped and feared, and has been, I believe, sometimes half-mad
with expectation. This has been his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) excitement,--what racing and
gambling are to other men. At last, the place was there, ready for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>), and they offered it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>). They begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) to take it, almost
on their knees. The Duke of St. Bungay was here all one morning about
it; but Mr. Palliser sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) away, and refused the place. It's all
over now, and the other man, whom they all hate so much, is to remain
in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) refuse it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I keep on telling you--because of me. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found that I wanted looking
after, and that Mrs. Marsham and Mr. Bott between them couldn't do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Cora! how can you talk in that way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you knew all, you might well ask how I could. You remember about
Lady Monk's ball, that you would not go to,--as you ought to have
done. If you had gone, Mr. Palliser would have been Chancellor of the
Exchequer at this minute; he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would, indeed. Only think of that! But
though you did not go, other people did who ought to have remained at
home. I went for one,--and you know who was there for another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What difference could that make to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, angrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It might have made a great deal of difference. And, for the matter
of that, so it did. Mr. Palliser was there too, but, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
went away immediately. I can't tell you all the trouble there had
been about Mrs. Marsham,--whether I was to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) with me or not.
However, I wouldn't take her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>), and didn't take her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>). The carriage went
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) first, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) was when we got there; and Mr. Bott was
there too. I wonder whether I shall ever make you understand it all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are some things I don't want to understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There they both were watching me,--looking at me the whole evening;
and, of course, I resolved that I would not be put down by them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, if I had been you, I would not have allowed their presence
to make any difference to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very easily said, my dear, but by no means so easily done.
You can't make yourself unconscious of eyes that are always looking
at you. I dared them, at any rate, to do their worst, for I stood up
to dance with Burgo Fitzgerald.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Cora!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't I? At any rate I did; and I waltzed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) for half
an hour. Alice, I never will waltz again;--never. I have done with
dancing now. I don't think, even in my maddest days, I ever kept it
up so long as I did then. And I knew that everybody was looking at
me. It was not only Mrs. Marsham and Mr. Bott, but everybody there.
I felt myself to be desperate,--mad, like a wild woman. There I was,
going round and round and round with the only man for whom I ever
cared two straws. It seemed as though everything had been a dream
since the old days. Ah! how well I remember the first time I danced
with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) aunt's house in Cavendish Square. They had only
just brought me out in London then, and I thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a god.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cora! I cannot bear to hear you talk like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know well enough that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) is no god now; some people say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) is
a devil, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) was like Apollo to me then. Did you ever see anyone
so beautiful as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you could have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>); but you will some day. I don't know
whether you care for men being handsome.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice thought of John Grey,
who was the handsomest man that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) made no answer.
<div class="bookquote">``I do; or, rather, I used to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>continued Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``I don't

handsome or ugly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But they do, you know. When I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the other night he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was just as
handsome as ever;--the same look, half wild and half tame, like an
animal you cannot catch, but which you think would love you so if you
could catch him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). In a little while it was just like the old time, and
I had made up my mind to care nothing for the people looking at me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you think that was right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't. Yes, I do; that is. It wasn't right to care about
dancing with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but it was right to disregard all the people gaping
round. What was it to them? Why should they care who I danced with?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is nonsense, dear, and you must know that it is so. If you were
to see a woman misbehaving herself in public, would not you look on
and make your comments? Could you help doing so if you were to try?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very severe, Alice. Misbehaving in public!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Cora. I am only taking your own story. According to that, you
were misbehaving in public.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Glencora got up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) chair near the window, on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had
been crouching close to Alice's knees, and walked away towards the
fireplace. <div class="bookquote">``What am I to say to you, or how am I to talk to you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``You would not have me tell you a lie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of all things in the world, I hate a prude the most,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady
Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cora, look here. If you consider it prudery on my part to disapprove
of your waltzing with Mr. Fitzgerald in the manner you have
described,--or, indeed, in any other manner,--you and I must differ
so totally about the meaning of words and the nature of things that
we had better part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice, you are the unkindest creature that ever lived. You are as
cold as stone. I sometimes think that you can have no heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind your saying that. Whether I have a heart or not I will
leave you to find out for yourself; but I won't be called a prude by
you. You know you were wrong to dance with that man. What has come of
it? What have you told me yourself this morning? In order to preserve
you from misery and destruction, Mr. Palliser has given up all his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
dearest hopes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) has had to sacrifice himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) might save
you. That, I take it, is about the truth of it,--and yet you tell me
that you have done no wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never said so.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had come back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) chair by the window,
and was again sitting in that crouching form. <div class="bookquote">``I never said that I
was not wrong. Of course I was wrong. I have been so wrong throughout
that I have never been right yet. Let me tell it on to the end, and
then you can go away if you like, and tell me that I am too wicked
for your friendship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have I ever said anything like that, Cora?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will, I dare say, when I have done. Well; what do you think
my senior duenna did,--the female one, I mean? She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) took my own
carriage, and posted off after Mr. Palliser as hard as ever she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could,
leaving the male duenna on the watch. I was dancing as hard as I
could, but I knew what was going on all the time as well as though
I had heard them talking. Of course Mr. Palliser came after me. I
don't know what else he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could do, unless, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had left me to
my fate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) came there, and behaved so well,--so much like a perfect
gentleman. Of course I went home, and I was prepared to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
everything, if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spoke a word to me,--that I intended to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>),
and that cart-ropes should not hold me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and go with that other man whose name you won't let me mention.
I had a letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in my pocket asking me to go. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked me
a dozen times that night. I cannot think how it was that I did not
consent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you did not consent to your own ruin and disgrace?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I did not consent to go off with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--anywhere. Of course it

be to be a man's mistress instead of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife. If I had not I should
be a thing to be hated and despised. When once I had done it I should
hate and despise myself. I should feel myself to be loathsome, and,
as it were, a beast among women. But why did they not let me marry
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), instead of driving me to this? And though I might have destroyed
myself, I should have saved the man who is still my husband. Do you
know, I told him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) all that,--told him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that if I had gone away with

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what did he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell you what he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said, only that we are all to go to Baden

seldom is angry, unless at some trumpery thing, as when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) threw the

child, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) arm round me and whispered to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) did not

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) must be fit to be an angel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never went out flirting with Jeffrey Palliser.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) did with you, which is all the same thing. And when Plantagenet

Now there is a spirit of wisdom about you that will do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), and

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice would give no promise then. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) first objection was that

in the affliction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) broken arm. <div class="bookquote">``And I must go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice,
remembering how necessary it was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should plead her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own cause
with George Vavasor's sister. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) acknowledged that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had not
intended to stay long in Westmoreland, probably not more than a week,
and it was at last decided that the Pallisers should postpone their
journey for four or five days, and that Alice should go with them
immediately upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) return from Vavasor Hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no objection;''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father, speaking with that voice
of resignation which men use when they are resolved to consider
themselves injured whatever may be done. <div class="bookquote">``I can get along in
lodgings. I suppose we had better leave the house, as you have given

while to point out to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), in answer to this, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) contribution
to their joint housekeeping should still remain the same as ever.
Such, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew would be the fact, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew also that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
would find her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father in the old house when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) returned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
travels. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own great troubles, the absence from London
would be as serviceable as it could be to Lady Glencora. Indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
had already begun to feel the impossibility of staying quietly at
home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could lecture her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) cousin, whose faults were open, easy to
be defined, and almost loud in their nature; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was not on that
account the less aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) too had cause to
be ashamed of herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was half afraid to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) face among her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
friends, and wept grievously over her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) own follies. Those cruel words
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) father rang in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) ears constantly:--<div class="bookquote">``Things of that sort are
so often over with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>The reproach, though cruel, was true, and
what reproach more galling could be uttered to an unmarried girl such
as was Alice Vavasor? She (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had felt from the first moment in which the
proposition was made to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>), that it would be well that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) should
for a while leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) home, and especially that drawing-room in Queen
Anne Street, which told her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) so many tales that she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) would fain forget,
if it were possible.

<p/>Mr. Palliser would not allow his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife to remain in London for the ten
or twelve days which must yet elapse before they started, nor could
he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) send her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) into the country alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) down to Matching
Priory, having obtained leave to be absent from the House for the
remainder of the Session, and remained with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) there till within
two days of their departure. That week down at Matching, as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
afterwards told Alice, was very terrible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) never spoke a word to
rebuke her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) never hinted that there had been aught in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) conduct
of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had cause to complain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) with a respect that
was perfect, and indeed with more outward signs of affection than
had ever been customary with him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>as Lady Glencora afterwards
expressed it, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was always looking after me. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) thought
that Burgo Fitzgerald had hidden himself among the ruins,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said
once to Alice. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) never suspected me, I am sure of that; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>)
thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) ought to look after me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>And Lady Glencora in this
had very nearly hit the truth. Mr. Palliser had resolved, from that
hour in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had walked out among the elms in Kensington Gardens,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would neither suspect his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife, nor treat her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
suspected her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). The blame had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), perhaps, more than it had
been hers. So much he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had acknowledged to himself, thinking of the
confession she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had made to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) before their marriage. But it was
manifestly his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) imperative duty,--his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) duty of duties,--to save her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
from that pitfall into which, as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) herself had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had
been so ready to fall. For her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sake and for his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) this must be done.
It was a duty so imperative, that in its performance he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had found
himself forced to abandon his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) ambition. To have his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife taken from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would be terrible, but the having it said all over the world that
such a misfortune had come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would be almost more terrible
even than that.

<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) went with his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife hither and thither, down at Matching,
allowing himself to be driven about behind Dandy and Flirt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>)
himself proposed these little excursions. They were tedious to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>),
but doubly tedious to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>) wife, who now found it more difficult than
ever to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) struggled to talk, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>) struggled to talk,
but the very struggles themselves made the thing impossible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>) sat
with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in the mornings, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>) sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in the evenings; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>)
breakfasted with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), lunched with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and dined with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>) went
to bed early, having no figures which now claimed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>) attention. And
so the week at last wore itself away. <div class="bookquote">``I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) yawning sometimes,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora said afterwards, <div class="bookquote">``as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) would fall in pieces.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXIII.

<p/>Mr. John Grey in Queen Anne Street.


<p/>Alice was resolved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) promise to Kate, and pay
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) visit to Westmoreland before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) started with the Pallisers. Kate
had written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) three lines with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) left hand, begging her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) to
come, and those three lines had been more eloquent than anything
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) could have written had her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) right arm been uninjured. Alice had
learned something of the truth as to the accident from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father;
or, rather, had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father's surmises on the subject. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
heard, too, how her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin George had borne himself when the will was
read, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had afterwards disappeared, never showing himself
again at the hall. After all that had passed she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) owed
Kate some sympathy. Sympathy may, no doubt, be conveyed by letter;
but there are things on which it is almost impossible for any writer
to express himself with adequate feeling; and there are things,
too, which can be spoken, but which cannot be written. Therefore,
though the journey must be a hurried one, Alice sent word down to
Westmoreland that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was to be expected there in a day or two. On
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) return she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was to go at once to Park Lane, and sleep there for
the two nights which would intervene before the departure of the
Pallisers.

<p/>On the day before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) started for Westmoreland her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
in the middle of the day, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that John Grey was going to
dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) in Queen Anne Street on that evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To-day, papa?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, to-day. Why not? No man is less particular as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eats
than Grey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not thinking of that, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) said.

<p/>To this Mr. Vavasor made no reply, but stood for some minutes looking
out of the window. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) prepared to leave the room, getting
himself first as far as the table, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) lifted a book, and then
on half-way to the door before Alice arrested him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, papa, you and Mr. Grey had better dine alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I meant without me,--as two men generally like to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I wanted that I should have asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) to dine at the club,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Vavasor, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) again attempted to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, papa--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear! If you mean to say that because of what has
passed you object to meet Mr. Grey, I can only tell you it's
nonsense,--confounded nonsense. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) chooses to come there can be
no reason why you shouldn't receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will look as though--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) were asked as my guest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's nonsense. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) yesterday, and I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) to come. I saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) again to-day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would come. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)'s not such a fool as
to suppose after that, that you asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not that I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if you run away you'll only make more of the thing than it's
worth. Of course I can't make you dine with me if you don't like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice did not like it, but, after some consideration, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might be open to the imputation of having made more of the
thing than it was worth if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ran away, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father called it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
was going to leave the country for some six or eight months,--perhaps
for a longer time than that, and it might be as well that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should
have an opportunity of telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) plans to Mr. Grey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could do it,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought, in such a way as to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) understand that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) last
quarrel with George Vavasor was not supposed to alter the footing on
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) stood with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not doubt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father had told
everything to Mr. Grey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew well enough what her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father's wishes
still were. It was not odd that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) should be asking John Grey to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) house, though such exercises of domestic hospitality were very
unusual with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). But,--so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) declared to herself,--such little
attempts on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) part would be altogether thrown away. It was a pity
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had not yet learned to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) better. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would receive
Mr. Grey as the mistress of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father's house now, for the last
time; and then, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) return in the following year, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would be at
Nethercoats, and the whole thing would be over.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) dressed herself very plainly, simply changing one black frock
for another, and then sat herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) drawing-room awaiting the
two gentlemen. It was already past the hour of dinner before her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
father came up-stairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was in the house, and in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) accused him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) of keeping out of the way, in order that
John Grey might be alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). Whether or no she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) were right in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) suspicions John Grey did not take advantage of the opportunity
offered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father came up first, and had seated himself
silently in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arm-chair before the visitor was announced.

<p/>As Mr. Grey entered the room Alice knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was flurried, but
still she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) managed to carry herself with some dignity. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) bearing was
perfect. But then, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) declared to herself afterwards, no possible
position in life would put him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) beside himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) usual quiet smile,--a smile that was genial even in its
quietness, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) took it fairly and fully into his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>);
but there was no squeezing, no special pressure, no love-making.
And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) Alice, as though his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) doing
so was of all things the most simply a matter of course. There was
no tell-tale hesitation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) voice. When did he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) ever hesitate at
anything? <div class="bookquote">``I hear you are going abroad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``with your cousin,
Lady Glencora Palliser.''


 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) managed to carry herself with some dignity.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice; <div class="bookquote">``I am going with them for a long tour. We shall
not return, I fancy, till the end of next winter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Plans of that sort are as easily broken as they are made,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
father. <div class="bookquote">``You won't be your own mistress; and I advise you not to
count too surely upon getting further than Baden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Mr. Palliser changes his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) mind of course I shall come home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said
Alice, with a little attempt at a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) a man not prone to changes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey. <div class="bookquote">``But all
London is talking about his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) change of mind at this moment. They say
at the clubs that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) might have been in the Cabinet if he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would, but
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) has taken up this idea of going abroad at the moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
was wanted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife's doing, I take it,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vavasor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the worst of being in Parliament,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey. <div class="bookquote">``A man can't do
anything without giving a reason for it. There must be men for public
life, of course; but, upon my word, I think we ought to be very much
obliged to them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) old lover's arm, and walked down with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) to
dinner, thought of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) former quarrels with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) on this very
subject. On this very point she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had never argued the
matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had never asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to argue with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had not
condescended so far as that. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) done so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
would have brought herself to think as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) thought. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would have
striven, at any rate, to do so. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not become unambitious,
tranquil, fond of retirement, and philosophic, without an argument
on the matter,--without being allowed even the poor grace of owning
herself to be convinced. If a man takes a dog with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from the
country up to town, the dog must live a town life without knowing the
reason why;--must live a town life or die a town death. But a woman
should not be treated like a dog. <div class="bookquote">``Had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deigned to discuss it with
me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice had so often said. <div class="bookquote">``But, no; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will read his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) books, and I
am to go there to fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slippers, and make his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tea for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>All this came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) again as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) walked down-stairs by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side;
and with it there came a consciousness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been driven by
this usage into the terrible engagement which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had made with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
cousin. That, no doubt, was now over. There was no longer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) any
question of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) marrying George Vavasor. But the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
been mad enough to think and talk of such a marriage, had of itself
been enough to ruin her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Things of that sort are so often over with
you!''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>After such a speech as that to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father, Alice
told herself that there could be no more <div class="bookquote">``things of that sort''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). But all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) misery had been brought about by this scornful
superiority to the ordinary pursuits of the world,--this looking down
upon humanity. <div class="bookquote">``It seems to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, very quietly, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
hand was yet upon his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arm, <div class="bookquote">``that your pity is hardly needed. I should
think that no persons can be happier than those whom you call our
public men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that is our old quarrel.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said it as though
the quarrel had simply been an argument between them, or a dozen
arguments,--as arguments do come up between friends; not as though
it had served to separate for life two persons who had loved each
other dearly. <div class="bookquote">``It's the old story of the town mouse and the country
mouse,--as old as the hills. Mice may be civil for a while, and
compliment each other; but when they come to speak their minds
freely, each likes his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) own life best.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said nothing more at the
moment, and the three sat down to their small dinner-table. It was
astonishing to Alice that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should be able to talk in this way, to
hint at such things, to allude to their former hopes and present
condition, without a quiver in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) voice, or, as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could
perceive, without any feeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father, <div class="bookquote">``I can't compliment your cook upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
soup.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't encourage her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), papa, by eating it often enough. And then
you only told me at two o'clock to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If a cook can't make soup between two and seven, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) can't make it
in a week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope Mr. Grey will excuse it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it good?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I won't say that it is, because I should
be pretending to have an opinion; but I should not have found out
anything against it of myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where do you dine usually, now you are in London?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Mr. Vavasor asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At the old club, at the corner of Suffolk Street. It's the oldest
club in London, I believe. I never belonged to any other, and
therefore can't compare them; but I can't imagine anything much
nicer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They give you better soup than ours?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've an excellent cook,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vavasor, with great gravity; <div class="bookquote">``one
of the best second-class cooks in London. We were very nearly getting
him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>), but you nicked him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) just in time. I know him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a great deal more than I do, or hope to do. There's another
branch of public life for which I'm quite unfitted. I'd as soon be
called on to choose a Prime Minister for the country, as I would a
cook for a club.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you would,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vavasor. <div class="bookquote">``There may be as many as a
dozen cooks about London to be looked up, but there are never more
than two possible Prime Ministers about. And as one of them must be
going out when the other is coming in, I don't see that there can be
any difficulty. Moreover, now-a-days, people do their politics for
themselves, but they expect to have their dinners cooked for them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The little dinner went on quietly and very easily. Mr. Vavasor found
fault with nearly everything. But as, on this occasion, the meat
and the drink, with the manner of the eating and drinking, did not
constitute the difficulty, Alice was indifferent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father's
censures. The thing needed was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) and Mr. Grey should be able
to sit together at the same table without apparent consciousness of
their former ties. Alice felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was succeeding indifferently
well while she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was putting in little mock defences for the cook. And
as for John Grey, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) succeeded so well that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) success almost made
Alice angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). It required no effort with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) at all to be
successful in this matter. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) can forget all that has passed,
so much the better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice to herself when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got up into the
drawing-room. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat herself down on the sofa, and cried. Oh!
what had she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) not lost! Had any woman ever been so mad, so reckless,
so heartless as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been! And she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had done it, knowing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cried bitterly, and then went away to wash her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might be ready to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) coffee when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) should come
up-stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) does not look well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had left the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--no: how can she (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) look well after what she (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) has gone through?
I sometimes think, that of all the people I ever knew, she (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) has been
the most foolish. But, of course, it is not for me to say anything
against my own child; and, of all people, not to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing that you could say against her (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) would make any difference to
me. I sometimes fancy that I know her (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) better than you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you think that she (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>)'ll still come round again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot say that I think so. No one can venture to say whether or
not such wounds as hers may be cured. There are hearts and bodies
so organized, that in them severe wounds are incurable, whereas in
others no injury seems to be fatal. But I can say that if she (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) be not
cured it shall not be from want of perseverance on my part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, Grey, I don't know how to thank you enough. I don't,
indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't seem to me to be a case for thanking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it isn't. I know that well enough. And in the ordinary
way of the world no father would think of thanking a man for wanting
to marry his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter. But things have come to such a pass with us,
that, by George! I don't feel like any other father. I don't mind
saying anything to you, you know. That claret isn't very good, but
you might as well take another glass.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, I will. I should have said that that was rather good
wine, now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not just the thing. What's the use of my having good wine here,
when nobody comes to drink it? But, as I was saying about Alice, of
course I've felt all this thing very much. I feel as though I were
responsible, and yet what could I do? She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'s her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own mistress through
it all. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) told me she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was going to marry that horrible
miscreant, my nephew, what could I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's over now, and we need not talk about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very kind of you to say so,--very. I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'s a good girl.
I do, indeed, in spite of it all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've no doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) being what you call a good girl,--none in the
least. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) has done to me does not impair her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) goodness. I don't
think you have ever understood how much all this has been a matter of
conscience with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Conscience!''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the angry father. <div class="bookquote">``I hate such conscience. I
like the conscience that makes a girl keep her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) word, and not bring
disgrace upon those she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) belongs to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not think that I am disgraced,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey, quietly, <div class="bookquote">``if
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will come and be my wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has meant to do right, and has
endeavoured to take care of the happiness of other people rather than
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has taken very little care of mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vavasor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not be at all afraid to trust mine to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),--if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will let
me do so. But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has been wounded sorely, and it must take time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And, in the meantime, what are we to do when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tells us that
Mr. George Vavasor wants another remittance? Two thousand pounds a
quarter comes heavy, you know!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) has had enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough! Did such a man ever have enough?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us hope, then, that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has had enough. Come;--may I
go up-stairs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes. I'll follow you. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll think that I mean something if I
leave you together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>From all this it will be seen that Alice's father and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) lover still
stood together on confidential terms. Not easily had Mr. Vavasor
brought himself to speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) daughter to John Grey, in such
language as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had now used; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had been forced by adverse
circumstances to pass the Rubicon of parental delicacy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had been
driven to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) wished-for son-in-law that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) did wish to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
as a son-in-law; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had been compelled to lay aside those little airs
of reserve with which a father generally speaks of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter,--and
now all was open between them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you really start to-morrow?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) stood close
over Alice's work-table. Mr. Vavasor had followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) into the
drawing-room, but had seated himself in an easy-chair on the other
side of the fire. There was no tone of whispering in Grey's voice,
but yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) spoke in a manner which showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) did not intend to
be audible on the other side of the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I start for Westmoreland to-morrow. We do not leave London for the
continent till the latter end of next week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will not be here again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I shall not come back to Queen Anne Street.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you will be away for many months?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Palliser talked of next Easter as the term of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) return. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
mentioned Easter to Lady Glencora. I have not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) myself since
I agreed to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What should you say if you met me somewhere in your travels?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had
now gently seated himself on the sofa beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>);--not so close to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) as to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) just cause to move away, but yet so near as to
make his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) quite private.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think that will be very likely,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) replied, not knowing
what to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it is very likely. For myself, I hate surprises. I could not
bring myself to fall in upon your track unawares. I shall go abroad,
but it will not be till the late autumn, when the summer heats are
gone,--and I shall endeavour to find you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To find me, Mr. Grey!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>There was a quivering in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) voice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
spoke, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not prevent, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would have given
worlds to prevent it. <div class="bookquote">``I do not think that will be quite fair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will not be unfair, I think, if I give you notice of my approach.
I will not fall upon you and your friends unawares.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not thinking of them. They would be glad to know you, of
course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And equally, of course! or, rather, much more of course, you will
not be glad to see me? That's what you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean that we had better not meet more than we can help.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think differently, Alice,--quite differently. The more we meet the
better,--that is what I think. But I will not stop to trouble you
now. Good night!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) got up and went away, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father went
with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Mr. Vavasor, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) chair, declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
would just walk through a couple of streets; but Alice knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
was gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) club.




<p/>CHAPTER LXIV.

<p/>The Rocks and Valleys.


<p/>During these days Mrs. Greenow was mistress of the old Hall down in
Westmoreland, and was nursing Kate assiduously through the calamity
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) broken arm. There had come to be a considerable amount of
confidence between the aunt and the niece. Kate had acknowledged to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother had behaved badly,--very badly; and the
aunt had confessed to the niece that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) regarded Captain Bellfield
as a fit subject for compassion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) was violent to you, and broke your arm? I always knew it was
so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Greenow had said, speaking with reference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) nephew. But
this Kate had denied. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``that was an accident. When he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)
went away and left me, he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) knew nothing about it. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) had broken
both my arms I should not have cared much. I could have forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)
that.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But that which Kate could not forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) was the fault which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had herself committed. For his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) sake she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) best to
separate Alice and John Grey, and George had shown himself to be
unworthy of the kindness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) treachery. <div class="bookquote">``I would give all I have
in the world to bring them together again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>Kate said. <div class="bookquote">``They'll come
together fast enough if they like each other,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow.
<div class="bookquote">``Alice is young still, and they tell me she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'s as good looking as
ever. A girl with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) money won't have far to seek for a husband,
even if this paragon from Cambridgeshire should not turn up again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know Alice, aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't. But I know what young women are, and I know what young
men are. All this nonsense about her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin George,--what difference
will it make? A man like Mr. Grey won't care about that,--especially
not if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) all about it. My belief is that a girl can have
anything forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll only tell it herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/>But Kate preferred the other subject, and so, I think, did Mrs.
Greenow herself. <div class="bookquote">``Of course, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) would say, ``marriage with
me, if I should marry again, would be a very different thing to your
marriage, or that of any other young person. As for love, that has
been all over for me since poor Greenow died. I have known nothing
of the softness of affection since I laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) cold grave, and
never can again. ``Captain Bellfield,<div class="bookquote">'' I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), `if you were to
kneel at my feet for years, it would not make me care for you in the
way of love.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) say to that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How am I to tell you what he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said? He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) talked nonsense about my
beauty, as all the men do. If a woman were hump-backed, and had only
one eye, they wouldn't be ashamed to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a Venus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, aunt, you are a handsome woman, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Laws, my dear, as if I didn't understand all about it; as if I
didn't know what makes a woman run after? It isn't beauty,--and it
isn't money altogether. I've seen women who had plenty of both, and
not a man would come nigh them. They didn't dare. There are some of
them, a man would as soon think of putting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm round a poplar
tree, they are so hard and so stiff. You know you're a little that
way yourself, Kate, and I've always told you it won't do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I'm too old to mend, aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, if you'll only set your wits to work and try. You've
plenty of money now, and you're good-looking enough, too, when you
take the trouble to get yourself up. But, as I said before, it isn't
that that's wanted. There's a stand-off about some women,--what the
men call a `nollimy tangere,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>that a man must be quite a furious
Orlando to attempt to get the better of it. They look as though
matrimony itself were improper, and as if they believed that little
babies were found about in the hedges and ditches. They talk of women
being forward! There are some of them a deal too backward, according
to my way of thinking.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yours is a comfortable doctrine, aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``That's just what I want it to be. I want things to be comfortable.
Why shouldn't things be nice about one when one's got the means?
Nobody can say it's a pleasant thing to live alone. I always thought
that man in the song hit it off properly. You remember what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says?
``The poker and tongs to each other belongs.<div class="bookquote">'' So they do, and that
should be the way with men and women.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the poker and tongs have but a bad life of it sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so often as the people say, my dear. Men and women ain't like
lumps of sugar. They don't melt because the water is sometimes warm.
Now, if I do take Bellfield,--and I really think I shall; but if I
do he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll give me a deal of trouble. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll always
be wanting my money, and, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll get more than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought.
I'm not a Solomon, nor yet a Queen of Sheba, no more than anybody
else. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>)'ll smoke too many cigars, and perhaps drink more
brandy-and-water than he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) ought. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>)'ll be making eyes, too, at
some of the girls who'll be fools enough to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me, aunt, if I thought all that ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>), I'm sure I wouldn't
marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>);--especially as you say you don't love him (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As for love, my dear, that's gone,--clear gone!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>Whereupon Mrs.
Greenow put up her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) handkerchief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Some women can love
twice, but I am not one of them. I wish I could,--I wish I could!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>These last words were spoken in a tone of solemn regret, which,
however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) contrived to change as quickly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had adopted it.
<div class="bookquote">``But my dear, marriage is a comfortable thing. And then, though
the Captain may be a little free, I don't doubt but what I shall
get the upper hand with him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) at last. I shan't stop his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) cigars and
brandy-and-water you know. Why shouldn't a man smoke and have a
glass, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) don't make a beast of himself? I like to see a man enjoy
himself. And then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) added, speaking tenderly of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) absent lover,
<div class="bookquote">``I do think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s fond of me,--I do, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lover</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So is Mr. Cheesacre for the matter of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Cheesy! I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) did talk so much about
money. I always like to believe the best I can of them. But then
there was no poetry about Cheesy. I don't care about saying it now,
as you've quite made up your mind not to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite, aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your grandfather's will does make a difference, you know. But, as
I was saying, I do like a little romance about them,--just a sniff,
as I call it, of the rocks and valleys. One knows that it doesn't
mean much; but it's like artificial flowers,--it gives a little
colour, and takes off the dowdiness. Of course, bread-and-cheese is
the real thing. The rocks and valleys are no good at all, if you
haven't got that, But enough is as good as a feast. Thanks to dear
Greenow,'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--here the handkerchief was again used--<div class="bookquote">``Thanks to dear

 (<font color='red'><b>the aunt niece</b></font>)</div><p/>In this way the aunt and niece became very confidential, and Mrs.
Greenow whispered into Kate's ears her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) belief that Captain Bellfield
might possibly make his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) way across the country to Westmoreland.
<div class="bookquote">``There would be no harm in offering him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) a bed, would there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Greenow asked. <div class="bookquote">``You see the inn at Shap is a long way off for morning
calls.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>Kate could not take upon herself to say that there would be
any harm, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) did not like the idea of having Captain Bellfield
as a visitor. <div class="bookquote">``After all, perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) mayn't come,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't see where he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) is to raise the money for such a journey, now that
he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) has quarrelled with Mr. Cheesacre.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Captain Bellfield must come to Vavasor Hall, at any rate let him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>)
not come till Alice's visit had been completed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>That was Kate's
present wish, and so much she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) ventured to confide to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt. But
there seemed to be no way of stopping him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I don't in the least know
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) is, my dear, and as for writing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>), I never did such a
thing in my life, and I shouldn't know how to begin.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Greenow
declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had not positively invited the Captain; but on this
point Kate hardly gave full credit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt's statement.

<p/>Alice arrived, and, for a day or two, the three ladies lived very
pleasantly together. Kate still wore her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) arm in a sling; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was
able to walk out, and would take long walks in spite of the doctor's
prohibition. Of course, they went up on the mountains. Indeed, all
the walks from Vavasor Hall led to the mountains, unless one chose to
take the road to Shap. But they went up, across the beacon hill, as
though by mutual consent. There were no questions asked between them
as to the route to be taken; and though they did not reach the stone
on which they had once sat looking over upon Haweswater, they did
reach the spot upon which Kate had encountered her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) accident. <div class="bookquote">``It was
here I fell,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and the last I saw of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) back, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) way down into the valley, there. When I got upon my legs
I could still see him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>). It was one of those evenings when the clouds
are dark, but you can see all objects with a peculiar clearness
through the air. I stood here ever so long, holding my arm, and
watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) never once turned to look back at me. Do you
know, Alice, I fancy that I shall never see him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) means to quarrel with you altogether?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can hardly tell you what I mean! He (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) seemed to me to be going away
from me, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) went into another world. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) figure against the
light was quite clear, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) walked quickly, and on he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) went, till
the slope of the hill hid him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) from me. Of course, I thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>)
would return to the Hall. At one time I almost feared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) would
come upon me through the woods, as I went back myself. But yet, I had
a feeling,--what people call a presentiment, that I should never see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) has never written?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not a word. You must remember that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) did not know that I had
hurt myself. I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) will not write, and I am sure, also, that I
shall not. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) wanted money I would send it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>), but I would not
write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) will always want money, Kate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) will. If you could know what I suffered when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) made me
write that letter to you! But, of course, I was a beast. Of course,
I ought not to have written it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought it a very proper letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a mean letter. The whole thing was mean! He (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) should have
starved in the street before he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) had taken your money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) should have
given up Parliament, and everything else! I had doubted much about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) before, but it was that which first turned my heart against
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>). I had begun to fear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) was not such a man as I had always
thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>),--as I had spoken of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had judged of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) for myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you did. But I had endeavoured to make you judge kindly.
Alice, dear! we have both suffered for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>); you more than I, perhaps;
but I, too, have given up everything for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>). My whole life has
been at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) service. I have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) creature, to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) bidding,
just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) might tell me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) made me do things that I knew to be
wrong,--things that were foreign to my own nature; and yet I almost
worshipped him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>). Even now, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) were to come back, I believe that I
should forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>), but I could never do more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) will never come back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) will never ask us to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>), or

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) has longed for money till the Devil has hardened his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said
Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet how tender he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) could be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) manner when he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) chose it;--how

behaved to us in Switzerland? Do you remember that balcony at Basle,
and the night we sat there, when the boys were swimming down the
river?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--I remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I! So do I! Alice, I would give all I have in the world, if I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you mean for my sake, Kate--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do mean for your sake. It made no difference to me. Whether I
stayed in Westmoreland or went abroad, I must have found out that my
god was made of bricks and clay instead of gold. But there was no
need for you to be crushed in the ruins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not crushed, Kate!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, you are too proud to own it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you mean about Mr. Grey, that would have happened just the same,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would it, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div><p/>There was nothing more than this said between them about Mr. Grey.
Even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin, Alice could not bring herself to talk freely on
that subject. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would never allow herself to think, for a moment,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been persuaded by others to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had treated
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had acted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own convictions of what
was right and wrong; and now, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had begun to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had been wrong, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would hardly confess as much even to herself.

<p/>They walked back, down the hill, to the Hall in silence for the
greater part of the way. Once or twice Kate repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) conviction
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) should never again see her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother. <div class="bookquote">``I do not know what may
happen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said in answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cousin's questions; <div class="bookquote">``but
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was passing out of my sight into the valley, I felt that I
was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) for the last time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is simply what people call a presentiment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly so; and presentiments, of course, mean nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate.

<p/>Then they walked on towards the house without further speech; but
when they reached the end of the little path which led out of the
wood, on to the gravelled sweep before the front door, they were both
arrested by a sight that met their eyes. There was a man standing,
with a cigar in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth, before them, swinging a little cane,
and looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up at the wood. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head a jaunty
little straw-hat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore a jacket with brass buttons, and white
trousers. It was now nearly the middle of May, but the summer does
not come to Westmoreland so early as that, and the man, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood
there looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), seemed to be cold and almost uncomfortable.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not as yet seen the two girls, who stood at the end of the
walk, arrested by the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Who is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>asked Alice, in a
whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain Bellfield,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, speaking with something very like
dismay in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! aunt Greenow's Captain?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; aunt Greenow's Captain. I have been fearing this, and now, what
on earth are we to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)? Look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). That's what aunt Greenow
calls a sniff of the rocks and valleys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>The Captain began to move,--just to move, as though it were necessary
to do something to keep the life in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) limbs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
cigar, and looked at the end of it with manifest regret. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) threw
it away among a tuft of shrubs his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) eye fell upon the two ladies, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) uttered a little exclamation. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) came forward, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
little straw-hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) hand, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) salutation. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Vavasor,
I am delighted,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Alice Vavasor, if I am not mistaken?
I have been commissioned by my dear friend Mrs. Greenow to go out and
seek you, but, upon my word, the woods looked so black that I did not
dare to venture;--and then, of course, I shouldn't have found you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Kate put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) left hand, and then introduced her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cousin to the
Captain. Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) little straw-hat, and strove to bear
himself as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) were at home and comfortable. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) failed,
and it was manifest that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) failed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was not the Bellfield who had
conquered Mr. Cheesacre on the sands at Yarmouth, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) wore the
same jacket and waistcoat, and must now have enjoyed the internal
satisfaction of feeling that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) future maintenance in life was
assured to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was not at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) ease. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) courage had sufficed
to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) to follow his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) quarry into Westmoreland, but it did not
suffice to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) comfortable while he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was there. Kate instantly
perceived his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) condition, and wickedly resolved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would make no
effort to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) went through some ceremony of introduction,
and then expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) surprise at seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) so far north.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I am a little surprised myself;--I am, indeed! But
I had nothing to do in Norwich,--literally nothing; and your aunt had
so often talked to me of the beauties of this place,'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) waved
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) hand round at the old house and the dark trees,--<div class="bookquote">``that I thought
I'd take the liberty of paying you a flying visit. I didn't mean to
intrude in the way of sleeping; I didn't indeed, Miss Vavasor; only
Mrs. Greenow has been so kind as to say--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are so very far out of the world, Captain Bellfield, that we
always give our visitors beds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't intend it; I didn't indeed, miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>Poor Captain Bellfield
was becoming very uneasy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) agitation. <div class="bookquote">``I did just put my bag,
with a change of things, into the gig, which brought me over, not
knowing quite where I might go on to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We won't send you any further to-day, at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Greenow has been very kind,--very kind, indeed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) has asked me
to stay till--Saturday!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Kate bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) lips in a momentary fit of anger. The house was her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
house, and not her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt's. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) remembered that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt had been
kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) at Norwich and at Yarmouth, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) allowed this feeling
to die away. <div class="bookquote">``We shall be very glad to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We are
three women together here, and I'm afraid you will find us rather
dull.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, no,--dull with you! That would be impossible!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how have you left your friend, Mr. Cheesacre?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite well;--very well, thank you. That is to say, I haven't seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) much lately. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) and I did have a bit of a breeze, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say that I did know, Captain Bellfield.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought, perhaps, you had heard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) seemed to think that I was too
particular in a certain quarter! Ha--ha--ha--ha! That's only my joke,
you know, ladies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>They then went into the house, and the Captain straggled in after
them. Mrs. Greenow was in neither of the two sitting-rooms which
they usually occupied. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), too, had been driven somewhat out of the
ordinary composure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) manner by the arrival of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) lover,--even
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had expected it, and had retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) room, thinking
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had better see Kate in private before they met in the
presence of the Captain. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you have seen my aunt since you
have been here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, yes. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) suggested that I had better walk
out and find you. I did find you, you know, though I didn't walk very
far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And have you seen your room?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--yes. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was kind enough to show me my room. Very nice indeed,
thank you;--looking out into the front, and all that kind of thing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The fellow</b></font>)</div>The poor fellow was no doubt thinking how much better was his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) lot at
Vavasor Hall than it had been at Oileymead. <div class="bookquote">``I shan't stay long, Miss
Vavasor,--only just a night or so; but I did want to see your aunt
again,--and you, too, upon my word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My aunt is the attraction, Captain Bellfield. We all know that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) actually simpered,--simpered like a young girl who is half elated
and half ashamed when her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lover is thrown in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) teeth. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) fidgeted
with the things on the table, and moved himself about uneasily from
one leg to the other. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was remembering that though he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had
contrived to bring himself to Vavasor Hall he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had not money enough
left to take him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) back to Norwich. The two girls left him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) and went to
their rooms. <div class="bookquote">``I will go to my aunt at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate, <div class="bookquote">``and find out
what is to be done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) means to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) means to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), and the sooner the better now. I
knew this was coming, but I did so hope it would not be while you
were here. It makes me feel so ashamed of myself that you should see
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Kate boldly knocked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt's door, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt received her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
with a conscious smile. <div class="bookquote">``I was waiting for you to come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Greenow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here I am, aunt; and, what is more to the purpose, there is Captain
Bellfield in the drawing-room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stupid man! I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) to take himself away about the place till

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't do that, aunt; it would be inhospitable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) is such an oaf. I hope you understand, my dear, that I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Kate, I really think I do. Why shouldn't I? It's a lonely sort

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not saying anything against him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>); only in that case you can't

break my bones I shouldn't be as whole as I am now. I might have had
Cheesacre if I liked, who is a substantial man, and could have kept

that;--and perhaps a little feeling that I might do some good to

Greenow, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) said this, put her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) handkerchief up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) eyes, and
wiped away the springing moisture. Tears were always easy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>),
but on this occasion Kate almost respected her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) tears. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I
hope you'll be happy, aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) makes me unhappy he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) shall pay for it;''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>and Mrs. Greenow, having
done with the tears, shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) head, as though upon this occasion she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
quite meant all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) said.

<p/>At dinner they were not very comfortable. Either the gloomy air of
the place and the neighbourhood of the black pines had depressed the
Captain, or else the glorious richness of the prospects before him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) thoughtful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had laid aside the jacket with the brass
buttons, and had dressed himself for dinner very soberly. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
behaved himself at dinner and after dinner with a wonderful sobriety,
being very unlike the Captain who had sat at the head of the table
at Mrs. Greenow's picnic. When left to himself after dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
barely swallowed two glasses of the old Squire's port wine before he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
sauntered out into the garden to join the ladies, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had seen
there; and when pressed by Kate to light a cigar he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) positively
declined.

<p/>On the following morning Mrs. Greenow had recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) composure,
but Captain Bellfield was still in a rather disturbed state of mind.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) efforts were to be crowned with success, and that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) wife, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) did not know how the preliminary
difficulties were to be overcome, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) did not know what to do
with himself at the Hall. After breakfast he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) fidgeted about in the
parlour, being unable to contrive for himself a mode of escape, and
was absolutely thrown upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) beam-ends when the widow asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) meant to do with himself between that and dinner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I'd better take a walk,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and perhaps the young
ladies--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you mean my two nieces,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow, <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid you'll
find they are engaged. But if I'm not too old to walk with--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>The
Captain assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was just of the proper age for a walking
companion, as far as his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) taste went, and then attempted some apology
for the awkwardness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) expression, at which the three women
laughed heartily. <div class="bookquote">``Never mind, Captain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow. <div class="bookquote">``We'll
have our walk all the same, and won't mind those young girls. Come
along.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>They started, not up towards the mountains, as Kate always
did when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) walked in Westmoreland, but mildly, and at a gentle
pace, as beseemed their years, along the road towards Shap. The
Captain politely opened the old gate for the widow, and then
carefully closed it again,--not allowing it to swing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) would
have done at Yarmouth. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) tripped up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) place beside her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>),
suggested his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) arm, which she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) declined, and walked on for some paces
in silence. What on earth was he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had done his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
love-making successfully, and what was he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) to do next?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Captain Bellfield,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>). They were walking very slowly,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was cutting the weeds by the roadside with his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) cane. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) knew
by her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) voice that something special was coming, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) left the
weeds and ranged himself close up alongside of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Well, Captain
Bellfield,--so I suppose I'm to be good-natured; am I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Arabella, you'll make me the happiest man in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all fudge.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) would have said, <div class="bookquote">``all rocks and valleys,''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>only he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) would not have understood her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I shall make you respectable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes; certainly. I quite intend that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the great thing that you should intend. Of course I am going
to make a fool of myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; don't say that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I don't say it, all my friends will say it for me. It's lucky for
you that I don't much care what people say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is lucky;--I know that I'm lucky. The very first day I saw you I
thought what a happy fellow I was to meet you. Then, of course, I was
only thinking of your beauty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Get along with you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, yes. Come, Arabella, as we are to be man and wife, you
might as well.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>At this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had got very close to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>), and had
recovered something of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) usual elasticity; but she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) would not allow
him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) even to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) waist. <div class="bookquote">``Out in the high road!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``How can you be so impertinent,--and so foolish?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You might as well, you know,--just once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain Bellfield, I brought you out here not for such fooling as

means are not considerable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, no; they are not, Mrs. Greenow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>The Captain</b></font>)</div>The Captain hesitated, and poked the ground
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) cane. <div class="bookquote">``Come, Captain Bellfield, let us have the truth at
once, and then we shall understand each other.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Captain</b></font>)</div>The Captain still
hesitated, and said nothing. <div class="bookquote">``You must have had something to live
upon, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>suggested the widow. Then the Captain, by degrees,
told his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) story. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had a married sister by whom a guinea a week was
allowed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). That was all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had been obliged to sell out of the
army, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was unable to live on his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) pay as a lieutenant. The
price of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) commission had gone to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) debts, and now,--yes,
it was too true,--now he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was in debt again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) owed ninety pounds
to Cheesacre, thirty-two pounds ten to a tailor at Yarmouth, over
seventeen pounds at his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) lodgings in Norwich. At the present moment
he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had something under thirty shillings in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) pocket. The tailor at
Yarmouth had lent him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) three pounds in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) might make his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
journey into Westmoreland, and perhaps be enabled to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) debts
by getting a rich wife. In the course of the cross-examination Mrs.
Greenow got much information out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>); and then, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was
satisfied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had learned, not exactly all the truth, but
certain indications of the truth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) forgave him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) all his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) offences.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now you will give a fellow a kiss,--just one kiss,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the
ecstatic Captain, in the height of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) bliss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow, <div class="bookquote">``there's a carriage coming on the road--close
to us.''




 (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXV.

<p/>The First Kiss.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow, <div class="bookquote">``there's a carriage coming on the road--close
to us.''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Greenow, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) spoke these words, drew back from the
Captain's arms before the first kiss of permitted ante-nuptial love
had been exchanged. The scene was on the high road from Shap to
Vavasor, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was still dressed in all the sombre habiliments
of early widowhood, and as neither he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) sweetheart were under
forty, perhaps it was as well that they were not caught toying
together in so very public a place. But they were only just in time
to escape the vigilant eyes of a new visitor. Round the corner of the
road, at a sharp trot, came the Shap post-horse, with the Shap gig
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>),--the same gig which had brought Bellfield to Vavasor on
the previous day,--and seated in the gig, looming large, with his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
eyes wide awake to everything round him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), was--Mr. Cheesacre.

<p/>It was a sight terrible to the eyes of Captain Bellfield, and by no
means welcome to those of Mrs. Greenow. As regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) annoyance
had chiefly reference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) two nieces, and especially to Alice.
How was she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to account for this second lover? Kate, of course, knew
all about it; but how could Alice be made to understand that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),
Mrs. Greenow, was not to blame,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had, in sober truth, told
this ardent gentleman that there was no hope for him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)? And even as
to Kate,--Kate, whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt had absurdly chosen to regard as the
object of Mr. Cheesacre's pursuit,--what sort of a welcome would
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) extend to the owner of Oileymead? Before the wheels had stopped,
Mrs. Greenow had begun to reflect whether it might be possible that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) should send Mr. Cheesacre back without letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) go on to the
Hall; but if Mrs. Greenow was dismayed, what were the feelings of the
Captain? For he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was aware that Cheesacre knew that of him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
had not told. How ardently did he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) now wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had sailed nearer
to the truth in giving in the schedule of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) debts to Mrs. Greenow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That man's wanted by the police,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre, speaking while the
gig was still in motion. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s wanted by the police, Mrs. Greenow,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) ardour he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) stood up in the gig and pointed at Bellfield.
Then the gig stopped suddenly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) fell back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) seat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
effort to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) falling forward. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s wanted by the police,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) shouted out again, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was able to recover his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) voice.

<p/>Mrs. Greenow turned pale beneath the widow's veil which she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had
dropped. What might not her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) Captain have done? He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) might have procured
things, to be sent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), out of shops on false pretences; or, urged
on by want and famine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) might have committed--forgery. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) said, and dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) hand from his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) arm, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had taken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's false,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div>said Bellfield.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll indict you for slander, my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div>said Bellfield.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pay me the money you owe me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre. <div class="bookquote">``You're a swindler!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Greenow cared little as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) lover being a swindler in Mr.
Cheesacre's estimation. Such accusations from him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had heard
before. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) did care very much as to this mission of the police
against her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) Captain. If that were true, the Captain could be her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
Captain no longer. <div class="bookquote">``What is this I hear, Captain Bellfield?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a lie and a slander. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) merely wants to make a quarrel between
us. What police are after me, Mr. Cheesacre?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the police, or the sheriff's officer, or something of the
kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the sheriff's officers!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Greenow, in a tone of
voice which showed how great had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) relief. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Cheesacre, you
shouldn't come and say such things;--you shouldn't, indeed. Sheriff's
officers can be paid, and there's an end of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll indict him (<font color='blue'><b>Sheriff</b></font>) for the libel--I will, as sure as I'm alive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div>said
Bellfield.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you make a fool of yourself. When
men can't pay their way they must put up with having things like that
said of them. Mr. Cheesacre, where were you going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was going to Vavasor Hall, on purpose to caution you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's too late,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow, sinking behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) veil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you haven't been and married him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) since yesterday? He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) only had
twenty-four hours' start of me, I know. Or, perhaps, you had it done
clandestine in Norwich? Oh, Mrs. Greenow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) got out of the gig, and the three walked back towards the Hall
together, while the boy drove on with Mr. Cheesacre's carpetbag. <div class="bookquote">``I
hardly know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow, <div class="bookquote">``whether we can welcome you. There
are other visitors, and the house is full.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not one to intrude where I'm not wanted. You may be sure of
that. If I can't get my supper for love, I can get at for money.
That's more than some people can say. I wonder when you're going to
pay me what you owe me, Lieutenant Bellfield?''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``I wonder when you're going to pay me what you
owe me, Lieutenant Bellfield?'' (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/>Nevertheless, the widow had contrived to reconcile the two men before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) reached the Hall. They had actually shaken hands, and the lamb
Cheesacre had agreed to lie down with the wolf Bellfield. Cheesacre,
moreover, had contrived to whisper into the widow's ears the true
extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) errand into Westmoreland. This, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) did not do
altogether in Bellfield's hearing. When Mrs. Greenow ascertained that
there was something to be said, she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) made no scruple in sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
betrothed away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``You won't throw a fellow over, will you,
now?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>whispered Bellfield into her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) ear as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) went. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) merely frowned
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) begone, so that the walk which Mrs. Greenow began
with one lover she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) ended in company with the other.

<p/>Bellfield, who was sent on to the house, found Alice and Kate
surveying the newly arrived carpet bag. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) knows `un,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy
who had driven the gig, pointing to the Captain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It belongs to your old friend, Mr. Cheesacre,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div>said Bellfield to
Kate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And has he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) come too?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate.

<p/>The Captain shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) shoulders, and admitted that it was hard.
<div class="bookquote">``And it's not the slightest use,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``not the least in the
world. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) never had a chance in that quarter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not enough of the rocks and valleys about him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), was there, Captain
Bellfield?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate. But Captain Bellfield understood nothing about
the rocks and valleys, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was regarded by certain eyes as
being both a rock and a valley himself.

<p/>In the meantime Cheesacre was telling his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) story. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) first asked, in a
melancholy tone, whether it was really necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) must abandon
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) hopes. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) wasn't going to say anything against the Captain,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if things were really fixed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) never begrudged any man his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Things are really fixed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) could, however, not keep himself from hinting that Oileymead was
a substantial home, and that Bellfield had not as much as a straw
mattress to lie upon. In answer to this Mrs. Greenow told him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) that
there was so much more reason why some one should provide the poor
man with a mattress. <div class="bookquote">``If you look at it in that light, of course it's
true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre. Mrs. Greenow told him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) did look at it
in that light. <div class="bookquote">``Then I've done about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre; <div class="bookquote">``and as
to the little bit of money he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) owes me, I must give him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) time about
it, I suppose.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Greenow assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) that it should be paid as
soon as possible after the nuptial benediction had been said over
them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) offered, indeed, to pay it at once if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was in distress
for it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) answered contemptuously that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) never was in distress
for money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) liked to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) own,--that was all.

<p/>After this he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) did not get away to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) next subject quite so easily
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) wished; and it must be admitted that there was a difficulty.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) could not have Mrs. Greenow he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) would be content to put up with
Kate for his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) wife. That was his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) next subject. Rumours as to the old
Squire's will had no doubt reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was now willing to
take advantage of that assistance which Mrs. Greenow had before
offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) in this matter. The time had come in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) ought to
marry; of that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was aware. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had told many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) friends in
Norfolk that Kate Vavasor had thrown herself at his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) head, and very
probably he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had thought it true. In answer to all his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) love speeches
to herself, the aunt had always told him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) what an excellent wife her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
niece would make him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). So now he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had come to Westmoreland with this
second string to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) bow. <div class="bookquote">``You know you put it into my head your own
self,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>pleaded Mr. Cheesacre. <div class="bookquote">``Didn't you, now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But things are so different since that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How different? I ain't different. There's Oileymead just where it
always was, and the owner of it don't owe a shilling to any man. How
are things different?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My niece has inherited property.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is that to make a change? Oh! Mrs. Greenow, who would have
thought to find you mercenary like that? Inherited property! Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
going to fling a man over because of that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Greenow endeavoured to explain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) niece could hardly
be said to have flung him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) over, and at last pretended to become angry
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) attempted to assert his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) position. <div class="bookquote">``Why, Mr. Cheesacre, I am
quite sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) never gave you a word of encouragement in her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you always told me I might have her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) for the asking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now I tell you that you mayn't. It's of no use your going on
there to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) will only send you away with an answer
you won't like. Look here, Mr. Cheesacre; you want to get married,
and it's quite time you should. There's my dear friend Charlie
Fairstairs. How could you get a better wife than Charlie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Charlie Fairstairs!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre, turning up his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) nose in disgust.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hasn't got a penny, nor any one belonging to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). The man who
marries her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will have to find the money for the smock she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stands up
in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's mercenary now, Mr. Cheesacre? Do you go home and think of it;
and if you'll marry Charlie, I'll go to your wedding. You shan't be
ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) clothing. I'll see to that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div><p/>They were now close to the gate, and Cheesacre paused before he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
entered. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think there's no chance at all for me, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know there's none. I've heard her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) speak about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Somebody else, perhaps, is the happy man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say anything about that, but I know that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wouldn't take
you. I like farming, you know, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) doesn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I might give that up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre readily,--<div class="bookquote">``at any rate, for a
time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no; it would do no good. Believe me, my friend, that it is
of no use.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) still paused at the gate. <div class="bookquote">``I don't see what's the use of my going
in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>). To this she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) no answer. <div class="bookquote">``There's a pride about
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``that I don't choose to go where I'm not wanted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't tell you, Mr. Cheesacre, that you are wanted in that light,
certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll go. Perhaps you'll be so good as to tell the boy with
the gig to come after me? That's six pound ten it will have cost me
to come here and go back. Bellfield did it cheaper, of course; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
travelled second class. I heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as I came along.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The expense does not matter to you, Mr. Cheesacre.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>To this he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) assented, and then took his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) leave, at first offering his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
hand to Mrs. Greenow with an air of offended dignity, but falling back
almost into humility during the performance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) adieu. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
was gone he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) to bring the Captain to Oileymead when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was married, and had begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) to tell Miss Vavasor how happy he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
should be to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And Mr. Cheesacre,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
walked back along the road, <div class="bookquote">``don't forget dear Charlie Fairstairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They were all standing at the front door of the house when Mrs.
Greenow re-appeared,--Alice, Kate, Captain Bellfield, the Shap boy,
and the Shap horse and gig. <div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>Kate asked in a low voice,
and everyone there felt how important was the question. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) has
gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow. Bellfield was so relieved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) could not
restrain his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) joy, but took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) little straw hat and threw it up
into the air. Kate's satisfaction was almost as intense. <div class="bookquote">``I am so
glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What on earth should we have done with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I
never was so disappointed in my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``I have heard so
much of Mr. Cheesacre, but have never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>Kate suggested that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) should get into the gig and drive after him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) ain't a been and
took hisself off?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>suggested the boy, whose face became very dismal
as the terrible idea struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). But, with juvenile craft, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
hand on the carpet-bag, and finding that it did not contain stones,
was comforted. <div class="bookquote">``You drive after him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), young gentleman, and you'll find
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) on the road to Shap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow. <div class="bookquote">``Mind you give him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) my
love,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) glee, <div class="bookquote">``and say I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'ll get his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
turnips in well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>This little episode went far to break the day, and did more than
anything else could have done to put Captain Bellfield at his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) ease.
It created a little joint-stock fund of merriment between the whole
party, which was very much needed. The absence of such joint-stock
fund is always felt when a small party is thrown together without
such assistance. Some bond is necessary on these occasions, and no
other bond is so easy or so pleasant. Now, when the Captain found
himself alone for a quarter of an hour with Alice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had plenty of
subjects for small-talk. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed. Old Cheesacre, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
absurdities, is not a bad sort of fellow at bottom;--awfully fond of
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) money, you know, Miss Vavasor, and always boasting about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's not pleasant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``No, the most unpleasant thing in
the world. There's nothing I hate so much, Miss Vavasor, as that kind
of talking. My idea is this,--when a man has lots of money, let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
make the best use he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can of it, and say nothing about it. Nobody ever
heard me talking about my money.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) knew that Alice knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was
a pauper; but, nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had the satisfaction of speaking of
himself as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) were not a pauper.

<p/>In this way the afternoon went very pleasantly. For an hour before
dinner Captain Bellfield was had into the drawing-room and was
talked to by his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) widow on matters of business; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had of course
known that this was necessary. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) scolded him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) soundly about those
sheriff's officers. Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) not told her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)? <div class="bookquote">``As long as there's
anything kept back, I won't have you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I won't become your
wife till I'm quite sure there's not a penny owing that is not shown
in the list.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Then I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) did tell her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) all,--or nearly all. When
all was counted it was not so very much. Three or four hundred pounds
would make him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) a new man, and what was such a sum as that to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
wealthy widow! Indeed, for a woman wanting a husband of that sort,
Captain Bellfield was a safer venture than would be a man of a higher
standing among his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) creditors. It is true Bellfield might have been
a forger, or a thief, or a returned convict,--but then his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) debts
could not be large. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) have done his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) best, he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) could not have
obtained credit for a thousand pounds; whereas, no one could tell the
liabilities of a gentleman of high standing. Burgo Fitzgerald was a
gentleman of high standing, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) creditors would have swallowed up
every shilling that Mrs. Greenow possessed; but with Captain Bellfield
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) was comparatively safe.

<p/>Upon the whole I think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) was lucky in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) choice; or, perhaps,
I might more truly say, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) had chosen with prudence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was no
forger, or thief--in the ordinary sense of the word; nor was he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) a
returned convict. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was simply an idle scamp, who had hung about the
world for forty years, doing nothing, without principle, shameless,
accustomed to eat dirty puddings, and to be kicked--morally
kicked--by such men as Cheesacre. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was moderate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
greediness, and possessed of a certain appreciation of the comfort
of a daily dinner, which might possibly suffice to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) from
straying very wide as long as his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) intended wife should be able to
keep the purse-strings altogether in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own hands. Therefore, I say
that Mrs. Greenow had been lucky in her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) choice, and not altogether
without prudence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think of taking this house,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and of living here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, in Westmoreland!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain, with something of dismay
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) tone. What on earth would he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) do with himself all his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) life in
that gloomy place!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, in Westmoreland. Why not in Westmoreland as well as anywhere
else? If you don't like Westmoreland, it's not too late yet, you
know.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>In answer to this the poor Captain was obliged to declare that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had no objection whatever to Westmoreland.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been talking to my niece about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Greenow, <div class="bookquote">``and
I find that such an arrangement can be made very conveniently. The
property is left between her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) uncle,--the father of my other
niece, and neither of them want to live here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But won't you be rather dull, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We could go to Yarmouth, you know, in the autumn.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>Then the
Captain's visage became somewhat bright again. <div class="bookquote">``And perhaps, if you
are not extravagant, we could manage a month or so in London during
the winter, just to see the plays and do a little shopping.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>Then the
Captain's face became very bright. <div class="bookquote">``That will be delightful,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And as for being dull,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow, <div class="bookquote">``when people grow old
they must be dull. Dancing can't go on for ever.''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>In answer to this
the widow's Captain assured the widow that she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was not at all old;
and now, on this occasion, that ceremony came off successfully which
had been interrupted on the Shap road by the noise of Mr. Cheesacre's
wheels. <div class="bookquote">``There goes my cap,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What a goose you are! What
will Jeannette say?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bother Jeannette,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
bliss. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) can do another cap, and many more won't be wanted.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Then
I think the ceremony was repeated.

<p/>Upon the whole the Captain's visit was satisfactory--at any rate to
the Captain. Everything was settled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was to go away on Saturday
morning, and remain in lodgings at Penrith till the wedding, which
they agreed to have celebrated at Vavasor Church. Kate promised to be
the solitary bridesmaid. There was some talk of sending for Charlie
Fairstairs, but the idea was abandoned. <div class="bookquote">``We'll have her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) afterwards,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow to Kate, <div class="bookquote">``when you are gone, and we shall want her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)
more. And I'll get Cheesacre here, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>). There's
no good in paying for two journeys.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>The Captain was to be allowed
to come over from Penrith twice a week previous to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) marriage; or
perhaps, I might more fairly say, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was commanded to do so. I
wonder how he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) felt when Mrs. Greenow gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) first five-pound
note, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) must make it do for a fortnight?--whether
it was all joy, or whether there was about his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) heart any touch of
manly regret?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain Bellfield, of Vavasor Hall, Westmoreland. It don't sound
badly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said to himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) travelled away on his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) first journey
to Penrith.




<p/>CHAPTER LXVI.

<p/>Lady Monk's Plan.


<p/>On the night of Lady Monk's party, Burgo Fitzgerald disappeared; and
when the guests were gone and the rooms were empty, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) aunt inquired
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) in vain. The old butler and factotum of the house, who was
employed by Sir Cosmo to put out the lamps and to see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) was
not robbed beyond a certain point on these occasions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) wife's
triumphs, was interrogated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) mistress, and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) thought
Mr. Burgo had left the house. Lady Monk herself knocked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>)
nephew's door, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) went up-stairs, ascending an additional
flight of stairs with her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) weary old limbs in order that she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) might
do so; she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) even opened the door and saw the careless debris of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
toilet about the room. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was gone. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, after all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) has
arranged it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) said to herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) went down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) own room.

<p/>But Burgo, as we know, had not <div class="bookquote">``arranged it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>It may be remembered
that when Mr. Palliser came back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife in the supper-room at
Lady Monk's, bringing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) the scarf which Lady Glencora had left
up-stairs, Burgo was no longer with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had become well aware
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had no chance left, at any rate for that night. The poor
fool, acting upon his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) aunt's implied advice rather than his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) own
hopes, had secured a post-chaise, and stationed it in Bruton Street,
some five minutes' walk from his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) aunt's house. And he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had purchased
feminine wrappings, cloaks, &c.--things that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) thought might be
necessary for his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) companion. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had, too, ordered rooms at the new
hotel near the Dover Station,--the London Bridge Station,--from
whence was to start on the following morning a train to catch the
tidal boat for Boulogne. There was a dressing-bag there for which he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
had paid twenty-five guineas out of his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) aunt's money, not having been
able to induce the tradesman to grant it to him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) on credit; and there
were other things,--slippers, collars, stockings, handkerchiefs, and
what else might, as he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) thought, under such circumstances be most
necessary. Poor thoughtful, thoughtless fool!

<p/>The butler was right. He (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) did leave the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) saw Lady Glencora
taken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) carriage from some back hiding-place in the hall, and
then slipped out, unmindful of his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) shining boots, and dress coat and
jewelled studs. He (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) took a Gibus hat,--his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) own, or that of some other
unfortunate,--and slowly made his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) way down to the place in Bruton
Street. There was the carriage and pair of horses, all in readiness;
and the driver, when he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) had placed himself by the door of the
vehicle, was not long in emerging from the neighbouring public-house.
<div class="bookquote">``All ready, your honour,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man. <div class="bookquote">``I shan't want you to-night,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo, hoarsely;--<div class="bookquote">``go away.''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And about the things, your
honour?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Take them to the devil. No; stop. Take them back with you,
and ask somebody to keep them till I send for them. I shall want them
and another carriage in a day or two.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) gave the man half a
sovereign, and went away, not looking at the little treasures which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had spent so much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) money in selecting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) love. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
was gone, the waterman and the driver turned them over with careful
hands and gloating eyes. <div class="bookquote">``It's a `eiress, I'll go bail,''  (<font color='red'><b>the waterman</b></font>)</div>said the
waterman. <div class="bookquote">``Pretty dear! I suppose her (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) parints was too many for her (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>said the driver. But neither of them imagined the enormity which the
hirer of the chaise had in truth contemplated.

<p/>Burgo from thence took his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) way back into Grosvenor Square, and from
thence down Park Street, and through a narrow passage and a mews
which there are in those parts, into Park Lane. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had now passed
the position of Mr. Palliser's house, having come out on Park Lane
at a spot nearer to Piccadilly; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) retraced his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) steps, walking
along by the rails of the Park, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) found himself opposite to
the house. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) stood there, leaning back upon the railings, and
looking up at Lady Glencora's windows. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) expect to see?
Or was he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), in truth, moved by love of that kind which can take joy
in watching the slightest shadow that is made by the one loved
object,--that may be made by her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), or, by some violent conjecture of
the mind, may be supposed to have been so made? Such love as that is,
I think, always innocent. Burgo Fitzgerald did not love like that. I
almost doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) can be said to have loved at all. There was
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) breast a mixed, feverish desire, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) took no trouble to
analyse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) wanted money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) wanted the thing of which this Palliser
had robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) wanted revenge,--though his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) desire for that was
not a burning desire. And among other things, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) wanted the woman's
beauty of the woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) coveted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) wanted to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) again as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had once kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was soft, and lovely,
and loving for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>). But as for seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shadow, unless its movement
indicated some purpose in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) favour,--I do not think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) cared
much about that.

<p/>And why then was he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) there? Because in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) unreasoning folly he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) did
not know what step to take, or what step not to take. There are men
whose energies hardly ever carry them beyond looking for the thing
they want. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might see him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) from the window, and come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>). I do
not say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) thought that it would be so. I fancy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) never
thought at all about that or about anything. If you lie under a tree,
and open your mouth, a plum may fall into it. It was probably an
undefined idea of some such chance as this which brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) against
the railings in the front of Mr. Palliser's house; that, and a feeling
made up partly of despair and partly of lingering romance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
was better there, out in the night air, under the gas-lamps, than
he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could be elsewhere. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) stood and looked, and cursed his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
ill-luck. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) curses had none of the bitterness of those which
George Vavasor was always uttering. Through it all there remained
about Burgo one honest feeling,--one conviction that was true,--a
feeling that it all served him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) right, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had better,
perhaps, go to the devil at once, and give nobody any more trouble.
If he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) loved no one sincerely, neither did he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) hate any one; and
whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) made any self-inquiry into his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) own circumstances, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)
always told himself that it was all his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) own fault. When he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) cursed
his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) fate, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) only did so because cursing is so easy. George Vavasor
would have ground his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) victims up to powder if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) knew how; but Burgo
Fitzgerald desired to hurt no one.

<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) stood till he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) was cold, and then, as the plum did not drop
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) mouth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) moved on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) went up into Oxford Street, and
walked along it the whole distance to the corner of Bond Street,
passing by Grosvenor Square, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) intended to return. At the
corner of Bond Street, a girl took hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>), and looked up into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I saw you once before.'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Then you saw the
most miserable devil alive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo. <div class="bookquote">``You can't be miserable,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl. <div class="bookquote">``What makes you miserable? You've plenty of
money.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``I wish I had,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo. <div class="bookquote">``And plenty to eat and drink,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the girl; <div class="bookquote">``and you are so handsome! I remember you. You
gave me supper one night when I was starving. I ain't hungry now.
Will you give me a kiss?'' (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``I'll give you a shilling, and that's
better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo. <div class="bookquote">``But give me a kiss too,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) gave
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) first the kiss, and then the shilling, and after that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
and passed on. <div class="bookquote">``I'm d--d if I wouldn't change with her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) said
to himself. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether anything really ails him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>thought the
girl. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was wretched before. Shouldn't I like to be good to
such a one as him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div><p/>Burgo went on, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) way into the house in Grosvenor Square,
by some means probably unknown to his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) aunt, and certainly unknown to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) uncle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) emptied his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) pockets as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) got into bed, and counted a
roll of notes which he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had kept in one of them. There were still a
hundred and thirty pounds left. Lady Glencora had promised that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
would see him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had said as much as that quite distinctly.
But what use would there be in that if all his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) money should then be
gone? He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) knew that the keeping of money in his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) pocket was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
quite an impossibility. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) aunt. What should he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
say to his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) aunt if he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) in the course of the coming day? Might
it not be as well for him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) to avoid his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) aunt altogether?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) breakfasted up-stairs in his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) bedroom,--in the bed, indeed, eating
a small paté de foie gras from the supper-table, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) read a French
novel. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was still reading his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) French novel in bed when his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
aunt's maid came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), saying that his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) aunt wished to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
before she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) went out. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me, Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``how is the old girl?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s as cross as cross, Mr. Burgo. Indeed, I shan't;--not a minute
longer. Don't, now; will you? I tell you she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s waiting for me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy</b></font>)</div>From
which it may be seen that Lucy shared the general feminine feeling in
favour of poor Burgo.

<p/>Thus summoned Burgo applied himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) toilet; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) did so,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) recruited his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) energies from time to time by a few pages of the
French novel, and also by small doses from a bottle of curaçoa which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) bedroom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was utterly a pauper. There was no pauper
poorer than he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) in London that day. But, nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) breakfasted
on paté de foie gras and curaçoa, and regarded those dainties very
much as other men regard bread and cheese and beer.

<p/>But though he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was dressing at the summons of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) aunt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had by no
means made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) would go to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) go to
her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)? What good would it do him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) would not give him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) more money.
She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) would only scold him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) misconduct. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) might, perhaps, turn
him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) out of the house if he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) did not obey her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>),--or attempt to do so;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) would be much more likely to do this when he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had made her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
angry by contradicting her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). In neither case would he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) leave the house,
even though its further use were positively forbidden him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), because
his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) remaining there was convenient; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) could gain nothing by
seeing <div class="bookquote">``the old girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had called her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) resolved to escape to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) club without attending to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) summons.

<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) aunt, who was a better general than he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), out-manoeuvred
him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) crept down the back stairs; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) could not quite
condescend to escape through the area, he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was forced to emerge upon
the hall, and here his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) aunt pounced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), coming out of the
breakfast-parlour. <div class="bookquote">``Did not Lucy tell you that I wanted to see you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>Lady Monk asked, with severity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) voice.

<p/>Burgo replied, with perfect ease, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was going out just to
have his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) hair washed and brushed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) would have been back in twenty
minutes. There was no energy about the poor fellow, unless, perhaps,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was hunting; but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) possessed a readiness which enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
to lie at a moment's notice with the most perfect ease. Lady Monk did
not believe him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) could not confute him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) let
the lie pass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind your hair now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I want to speak to you. Come
in here for a few minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>As there was no way of escape left to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) followed his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) aunt into
the breakfast-parlour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Burgo,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said, when she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had seated herself, and had made him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
sit in a chair opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I don't think you will ever do any
good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't much think I shall, aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, then, to do with yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,--I don't know. I haven't thought much about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't stay here in this house. Sir Cosmo was speaking to me
about you only yesterday morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be quite willing to go down to Monkshade, if Sir Cosmo likes
it better;--that is, when the season is a little more through.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) won't have you at Monkshade. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) won't let you go there again. And
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) won't have you here. You know that you are turning what I say into
joke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, aunt,''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you are;--you know you are. You are the most ungrateful,
heartless creature I ever met. You must make up your mind to leave
this house at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where does Sir Cosmo mean that I should go, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To the workhouse, if you like. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) doesn't care.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) does;--the least in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo,
opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) eyes, and stretching his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) nostrils, and looking into his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
aunt's face as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had great ground for indignation.

<p/>But the turning of Burgo out of the house was not Lady Monk's
immediate purpose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) would hang on there till the
season was over. After that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) must not be allowed to return again,
unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) should have succeeded in a certain enterprise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) had
now caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) in order that she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) might learn whether there was any
possible remaining chance of success as to that enterprise. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>)
received his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) indignation in silence, and began upon another subject.
<div class="bookquote">``What a fool you made of yourself last night, Burgo!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I;--more of a fool than usual?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe that you will never be serious about anything. Why did you
go on waltzing in that way when every pair of eyes in the room was
watching you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't help going on, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) liked it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,--say it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Cosmo</b></font>) fault. That's so like a man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, aunt, I'm not going to sit here and be abused. I couldn't
take her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) in my arms, and fly away with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) out of a crowd.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who wants you to fly away with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For the matter of that, I suppose that you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You! you haven't spirit to do that, or anything else. You are like a
child that is just able to amuse itself for the moment, and never can
think of anything further. You simply disgraced yourself last night,
and me too,--and her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>); but, of course, you care nothing about that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had a plan all ready;--only he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) came back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) came back. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) came back, when they sent him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
word how you and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) were going on. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) will have forgiven
her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), and after that, of course, the thing will be all over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you what, aunt; she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) would go if she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) knew how. When I was
forced to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) last night, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) promised to see me again. And as
for being idle, and not doing anything;--why, I was out in Park Lane
last night, after you were in bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What good did that do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It didn't do any good, as it happened. But a fellow can only
try. I believe, after all, it would be easier down in the
country,--especially now that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has taken it into his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) head to look
after her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monk</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Monk sat silent for a few moments, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) said in a low
voice, <div class="bookquote">``What did she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) say to you when you were parting? What were her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
exact words?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>), at any rate, was not deficient in energy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>)
was anxious enough to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) purpose accomplished. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) would have
conducted the matter with discretion, if the running away with Mr.
Palliser's wife could, in very fact, have been done by herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) would see me again. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) promised it twice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And was that all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What could she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) say more, when she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was forced to go away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) would go with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>),--half a dozen times, and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) did not once refuse.
I know she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) means it, if she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) knew how to get away. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) hates him (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>);--I'm
sure of it. A woman, you know, wouldn't absolutely say that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would
go, till she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) really meant it, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could have told me plainer. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would see
me again. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said that twice over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Again Lady Monk sat silent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) had a plan in her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) head,--a plan that
might, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) thought, give to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) nephew one more chance. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>)
hesitated before she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) could bring herself to explain it in detail.
At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) had lent a little aid to this desired abduction of Mr.
Palliser's wife, but in lending it had said no word upon the subject.
During the last season she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had succeeded in getting Lady Glencora
to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) house in London, and had taken care that Burgo should meet
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) there. Then a hint or two had been spoken, and Lady Glencora
had been asked to Monkshade. Lady Glencora, as we know, did not go
to Monkshade, and Lady Monk had then been baffled. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) did not
therefore give up the game. Having now thought of it so much, she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>)
began to speak of it more boldly, and had procured money for her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>)
nephew that he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) might thereby be enabled to carry off the woman. But
though this had been well understood between them, though words had
been spoken which were sufficiently explicit, the plan had not been
openly discussed. Lady Monk had known nothing of the mode in which
Lady Glencora was to have been carried off after her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) party, nor
whither she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was to have been taken. But now,--now she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) must arrange it
herself, and have a scheme of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) own, or else the thing must fail
absolutely. Even she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was almost reluctant to speak out plainly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
nephew on such a subject. What if he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) should be false to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), and tell
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)? But when a woman has made such schemes, nothing distresses
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) so sadly as their failure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would risk all rather than that Mr.
Palliser should keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will try and help you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said at last, speaking hoarsely,
almost in a whisper, <div class="bookquote">``if you have courage to make an attempt
yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Courage!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``What is it you think I am afraid of? Mr. Palliser?
I'd fight him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>),--or all the Pallisers, one after another, if it would
do any good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fighting! There's no fighting wanted, as you know well enough. Men
don't fight nowadays. Look here! If you can get her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to call here some
day,--say on Thursday, at three o'clock,--I will be here to receive
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and instead of going back into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) carriage, you can have a cab
for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) somewhere near. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can come, as it were, to make a morning
call.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A cab!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; a cab won't kill her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and it is less easily followed than a
carriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And where shall we go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a train to Southampton at four, and the boat sails for
Jersey at half-past six; you will be in Jersey the next morning,
and there is a boat goes on to St. Malo, almost at once. You can go
direct from one boat to the other,--that is, if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has strength and
courage.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monk</b></font>)</div>After that, who will say that Lady Monk was not a devoted
aunt?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That would do excellently well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said the enraptured Burgo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will have difficulty in getting away from me, out of the house.
Of course I shall say nothing about it, and shall know nothing about
it. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had better tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) coachman to drive somewhere to pick
some one up, and to return;--out somewhere to Tyburnia, or down to
Pimlico. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can leave me, and go out on foot, to where you
have the cab. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can tell the hall-porter that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will walk to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
carriage. Do you understand?''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>Burgo declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) did understand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must call on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and make your way in, and see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and arrange
all this. It must be a Thursday, because of the boats.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>)
made inquiry about his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) money, and took from him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) the notes which he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
had, promising to return them, with something added, on the Thursday
morning; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) asked, with a little whine, for a five-pound note,
and got it. Burgo then told her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) about the travelling-bags and the
stockings, and they were quite pleasant and confidential. <div class="bookquote">``Bid her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
come in a stout travelling-dress,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monk</b></font>)</div>said Lady Monk. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can wear some
lace or something over it, so that the servants won't observe it. I
will take no notice of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>an aunt</b></font>)</div>Was there ever such an aunt?

<p/>After this, Burgo left his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) aunt, and went away to his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) club, in a
state of most happy excitement.




<p/>CHAPTER LXVII.

<p/>The Last Kiss.


<p/>Alice, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) return from Westmoreland, went direct to Park Lane,
whither Lady Glencora and Mr. Palliser had also returned before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was to remain with them in London one entire day, and on
the morning after that they were to start for Paris. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) found
Mr. Palliser in close attendance upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife. Not that there was
anything in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) manner which at all implied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was keeping watch
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was more with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), or closer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) than a
loving husband might wish to be with a young wife; but the mode of
life was very different from that which Alice had seen at Matching
Priory!

<p/>On her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) arrival Mr. Palliser himself received her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in the hall, and took
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had taken off her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) travelling hat. <div class="bookquote">``We
are so much obliged to you, Miss Vavasor,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I feel it quite
as deeply as Glencora.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``it is I that am under obligation to you for
taking me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) merely smiled, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) head, and then took her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) up-stairs.
On the stairs he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said one other word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``You must forgive me if
I was cross to you that night she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) went out among the ruins.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Alice
muttered something,--some little fib of courtesy as to the matter
having been forgotten, or never borne in mind; and then they went on
to Lady Glencora's room. It seemed to Alice that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was not so big
or so much to be dreaded as when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) at Matching. His (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
descent from an expectant, or more than an expectant, Chancellor of
the Exchequer, down to a simple, attentive husband, seemed to affect
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) gait, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) voice, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) demeanour. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) received Alice at
the Priory he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) certainly loomed before her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) as something great, whereas
now his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) greatness seemed to have fallen from him (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>). We must own that
this was hard upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>), seeing that the deed by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) had divested
himself of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) greatness had been so pure and good!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Alice, this is so good of you! I am all in the midst of
packing, and Plantagenet is helping me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Plantagenet/Plantagenet Palliser</b></font>)</div>Plantagenet winced a little
under this, as the hero of old must have winced when he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) was found
with the distaff. Mr. Palliser had relinquished his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) sword of state
for the distaff which he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had assumed, and could take no glory in the
change. There was, too, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife's voice the slightest hint of
mockery, which, slight as it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) perhaps thought she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might have
spared. <div class="bookquote">``You have nothing left to pack,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>continued Glencora, <div class="bookquote">``and I
don't know what you can do to amuse yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will help you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But we have so very nearly done. I think we shall have to pull all
the things out, and put them up again, or we shall never get through
to-morrow. We couldn't start to-morrow;--could we, Plantagenet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not very well, as your rooms are ordered in Paris for the next day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As if we couldn't find rooms at every inn on the road. Men are
so particular. Now in travelling I should like never to order
rooms,--never to know where I was going or when I was going, and to
carry everything I wanted in a market-basket.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice, who by this
time had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) friend along the passage to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) bedroom, and
had seen how widely the packages were spread about, bethought herself
that the market-basket should be a large one. <div class="bookquote">``And I would never
travel among Christians. Christians are so slow, and they wear
chimney-pot hats everywhere. The further one goes from London among
Christians, the more they wear chimney-pot hats. I want Plantagenet
to take us to see the Kurds, but he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) won't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think that would be fair to Miss Vavasor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser,
who had followed them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't put the blame on her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``Women have
always pluck for anything. Wouldn't you like to see a live Kurd,
Alice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't exactly know where they live,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I. I have not the remotest idea of the way to the Kurds. You see
my joke, don't you, though Plantagenet doesn't? But one knows that
they are Eastern, and the East is such a grand idea!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think we'll content ourselves with Rome, or perhaps Naples, on
this occasion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser.

<p/>The notion of Lady Glencora packing anything for herself was as good
a joke as that other one of the Kurds and whey. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went flitting
about from room to room, declaring that this thing must be taken,
and that other, till the market-basket would have become very large
indeed. Alice was astonished at the extent of the preparations, and
the sort of equipage with which they were about to travel. Lady
Glencora was taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) own carriage. <div class="bookquote">``Not that I shall ever use it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said to Alice, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Kurd</b></font>) insists upon it, to show that I am not
supposed to be taken away in disgrace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kurd</b></font>) is so good;--isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Kurd</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``I know no one better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so dull!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``But I fancy that all husbands are
dull from the nature of their position. If I were a young woman's
husband, I shouldn't know what to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that wasn't dull.''

 (<font color='red'><b>women servants</b></font>)</div><p/>Two women and two men servants were to be taken. Alice had received
permission to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own maid--<div class="bookquote">``or a dozen, if you want them,''
 (<font color='red'><b>maid</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora had said. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Palliser in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) present mood would think
nothing too much to do for you. If you were to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) to go among
the Kurds, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)'d go at once;--or on to Crim Tartary, if you made a
point of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>But as both Lady Glencora's servants spoke French, and
as her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) own did not, Alice trusted herself in that respect to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
cousin. <div class="bookquote">``You shall have one all to yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``I
only take two for the same reason that I take the carriage,--just as
you let a child go out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) best frock, for a treat, after you've
scolded her (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>When Alice asked why it was supposed that Mr. Palliser was so
specially devoted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), the thing was explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You see,
my dear, I have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) everything. I always do tell everything.
Nobody can say I am not candid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) knows about your not letting me
come to your house in the old days. Oh, Alice!--you were wrong then;
I shall always say that. But it's done and gone; and things that are
done and gone shall be done and gone for me. And I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) all that
you said,--about you know what. I have had nothing else to do but
make confessions for the last ten days, and when a woman once begins,
the more she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) confesses the better. And I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) that you refused
Jeffrey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did indeed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) likes you the better for that. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>)'d
let Jeffrey marry you now if you both wished it;--and then, oh
dear!--supposing that you had a son and that we adopted it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cora, if you go on in that way I will not remain with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must, my dear. You can't escape now. At any rate, you can't
when we once get to Paris. Oh dear! you shouldn't grudge me my little
naughtinesses. I have been so proper for the last ten days. Do you
know I got into a way of driving Dandy and Flirt at the rate of six
miles an hour, till I'm sure the poor beasts thought they were always
going to a funeral. Poor Dandy and poor Flirt! I shan't see them now
for another year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/>On the following morning they breakfasted early, because Mr. Palliser
had got into an early habit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had said that early hours would be
good for them. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>) never tells me why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.
<div class="bookquote">``I think it is pleasant when people are travelling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.
<div class="bookquote">``It isn't that,''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin answered; <div class="bookquote">``but we are all to be such
particularly good children. It's hardly fair, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>) went to
sleep last night after dinner while you and I kept ourselves awake:
but we needn't do that another night, to be sure.''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>After breakfast
they all three went to work to do nothing. It was ludicrous and
almost painful to see Mr. Palliser wandering about and counting the
boxes, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could do any good by that. At this special crisis
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hated his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) papers and figures and statistics, and
could not apply himself to them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), whose application had been
so unremitting, could apply himself now to nothing. His (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) world had
been brought to an abrupt end, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was awkward at making a new
beginning. I believe that they all three were reading novels before
one o'clock. Lady Glencora and Alice had determined that they would
not leave the house throughout the day. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing has been said about
it, but I regard it as part of the bond that I'm not to go out
anywhere. Who knows but what I might be found in Gloucester Square?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>There was, however, no absolute necessity that Mr. Palliser should
remain with them; and, at about three, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) prepared himself for a
solitary walk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would not go down to the House. All interest in the
House was over with him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) for the present. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had the Speaker's leave
to absent himself for the season. Nor would he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) call on anyone. All
his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) friends knew, or believed they knew, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had left town. His (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
death and burial had been already chronicled, and were he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) now to
reappear, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could reappear only as a ghost. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was being talked
of as the departed one;--or rather, such talk on all sides had now
come nearly to an end. The poor Duke of St. Bungay still thought of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) with regret when more than ordinarily annoyed by some special
grievance coming to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) from Mr. Finespun; but even the Duke had
become almost reconciled to the present order of things. Mr. Palliser
knew better than to disturb all this by showing himself again in
public; and prepared himself, therefore, to take another walk under
the elms in Kensington Gardens.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) head in the hall, and was in the act of putting
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) gloves, when there came a knock at the front door. The
hall-porter was there, a stout, plethoric personage, not given
to many words, who was at this moment standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) master's
umbrella in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hand, looking as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would fain be of some use
to somebody, if any such utility were compatible with the purposes
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) existence. Now had come this knock at the door, while the
umbrella was still in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hand, and the nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) visage changed,
and it was easy to see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was oppressed by the temporary
multiplicity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) duties. <div class="bookquote">``Give me the umbrella, John,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Palliser. John gave up the umbrella, and opening the door disclosed
Burgo Fitzgerald standing upon the door-step. <div class="bookquote">``Is Lady Glencora at
home?''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>asked Burgo, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had seen the husband. John turned a
dismayed face upon his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) master, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) knew that the comer ought
not to be making a morning call at that house,--as no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did
know very well,--and made no instant reply. <div class="bookquote">``I am not sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Palliser, making his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) way out as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had originally purposed. <div class="bookquote">``The
servant will find out for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) went on his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) way across Park
Lane and into the Park, never once turning back his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) face to see
whether Burgo had effected an entrance into the house. Nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
return a minute earlier than he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) would otherwise have done. After all,
there was something chivalrous about the man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; Lady Glencora was at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>the porter</b></font>)</div>said the porter, not stirring to
make any further inquiry. It was no business of his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) if Mr. Palliser
chose to receive such a guest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had not been desired to say that
her (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) ladyship was not at home. Burgo was therefore admitted and shown
direct up into the room in which Lady Glencora was sitting. As chance
would have it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was alone. Alice had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) and was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
own chamber, and Lady Glencora was sitting at the window of the
small room up-stairs that overlooked the Park. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was seated on a
footstool with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) face between her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) hands when Burgo was admitted,
thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), and of what the world might have been to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had
<div class="bookquote">``they left her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was in the habit of saying to Alice and
to herself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) rose quickly, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) only as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was rising. <div class="bookquote">``Ask
Miss Vavasor to come to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, as the servant left the room;
and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) came forward to greet her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) lover.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cora,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) said, dashing at once into his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) subject--hopelessly, but
still with a resolve to do as he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had said that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) would do. <div class="bookquote">``Cora,
I have come to you, to ask you to go with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not go with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not answer me in that way, without a moment's thought. Everything
is arranged--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, everything is arranged,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Fitzgerald, let me
ask you to leave me alone, and to behave to me with generosity.
Everything is arranged. You can see that my boxes are all prepared
for going. Mr. Palliser and I, and my friend, are starting to-morrow.
Wish me God-speed and go, and be generous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is this to be the end of everything?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was standing close to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), but hitherto he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had only touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand at greeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Give
me your hand, Cora,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--I will never give you my hand again. You should be generous to
me and go. This is to be the end of everything,--of everything that
is common to you and to me. Go, when I ask you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cora; did you ever love me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I did love you. But we were separated, and there was no room
for love left between us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are as dear to me now,--dearer than ever you were. Do not look
at me like that. Did you not tell me when we last parted that I might
come to you again? Are we children, that others should come between
us and separate us like that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Burgo; we are children. Here is my cousin coming. You must
leave me now.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) spoke the door was opened and Alice entered the
room. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Vavasor, Mr. Fitzgerald,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``I have
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) to go and leave me. Now that you have come, Alice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) will
perhaps obey me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice was dumbfounded, and knew not how to speak either to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) or to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes riveted on the face of the man of
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had heard so much. Yes; certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very beautiful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had never before seen man's beauty such as that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found it quite
impossible to speak a word to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then--at the spur of the moment,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) acknowledged the introduction with a slight inclination of
the head, and then stood silent, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) were waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Fitzgerald, why do you not leave me and go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/>Poor Burgo also found it difficult enough to speak. What could he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
say? His (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) cause was one which certainly did not admit of being pleaded
in the presence of a strange lady; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) might have known from the
moment in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) heard Glencora's request that a third person
should be summoned to their meeting--and probably did know, that
there was no longer any hope for him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>). It was not on the cards that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
should win. But there remained one thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) must do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) must get
himself out of that room; and how was he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) to effect that?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had hoped,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), looking at Alice, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) addressed Lady
Glencora--<div class="bookquote">``I had hoped to be allowed to speak to you alone for a few
minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Mr. Fitzgerald; it cannot be so. Alice do not go. I sent for my
cousin when I saw you, because I did not choose to be alone with you.
I have asked you to go--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You perhaps have not understood me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand you well enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, Mr. Fitzgerald,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, <div class="bookquote">``why do you not do as Lady
Glencora has asked you? You know--you must know, that you ought not
to be here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing of the kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), still standing his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, <div class="bookquote">``we will leave Mr. Fitzgerald here, since
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) drives us from the room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/>In such contests, a woman has ever the best of it at all points. The
man plays with a button to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) foil, while the woman uses a weapon
that can really wound. Burgo knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) must go,--felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
must skulk away as best he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) might, and perhaps hear a low titter of
half-suppressed laughter as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) went. Even that might be possible.
<div class="bookquote">``No, Lady Glencora,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I will not drive you from the room.
As one must be driven out, it shall be I. I own I did think that you
would at any rate have been--less hard to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) then turned to go,
bowing again very slightly to Miss Vavasor.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was on the threshold of the door before Glencora's voice recalled
him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Oh my God!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am hard,--harder than flint. I am
cruel. Burgo!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was back with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) in a moment, and had taken
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) by the hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Glencora,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, <div class="bookquote">``pray,--pray let him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) go. Mr. Fitzgerald, if
you are a man, do not take advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) folly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``I will speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>),
and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) shall leave me.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) by the hand now
and turning to him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), away from Alice, who had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) by the arm.
<div class="bookquote">``Burgo,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, repeating his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) name twice again, with all the
passion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could throw into the word,--<div class="bookquote">``Burgo, no good can come
of this. Now, you must leave me. You must go. I shall stay with my
husband as I am bound to do. Because I have wronged you, I will not
wrong him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) also. I loved you;--you know I loved you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) still held
him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) by the hand, and was now gazing up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) face, while the tears
were streaming from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, <div class="bookquote">``you have heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) all that you can care to

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will never leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), while she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) tells me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) loves me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Burgo, you will;--you must! I shall never tell you that again,
never. Do as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) bids you. Go, and leave us;--but I could not bear
that you should tell me that I was hard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are hard;--hard and cruel, as you said, yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I? May God forgive you for saying that of me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why do you send me away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I am a man's wife, and because I care for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) honour, if not
for my own. Alice, let us go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) still held her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would have been gone from him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) not
stooped over her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) waist. In doing this, I
doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was quicker than she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would have been had she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) chosen
to resist him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>). As it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) bosom, and, stooping
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) lips. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and making his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) way out
of the room, and down the stairs, got himself out into the street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God, that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is gone!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may say so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, <div class="bookquote">``for you have lost nothing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have gained everything!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have I? I did not know that I had ever gained anything, as yet. The
only human being to whom I have ever yet given my whole heart,--the
only thing that I have ever really loved, has just gone from me for
ever, and you bid me thank God that I have lost him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). There is no room
for thankfulness in any of it;--either in the love or in the loss. It
is all wretchedness from first to last!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) understands now that you meant it when you told him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
to leave you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I meant it. I am beginning to know myself by degrees. As
for running away with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), I have not the courage to do it. I can
think of it, scheme for it, wish for it;--but as for doing it, that
is beyond me. Mr. Palliser is quite safe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) need not try to coax me
to remain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice knew that it was useless to argue with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) came and sat
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),--for Lady Glencora had again placed herself on the stool
by the window,--and tried to sooth her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) by smoothing her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) hair, and
nursing her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) like a child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I know that I ought to stay where I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said,
breaking out, almost with rage, and speaking with quick, eager voice.
<div class="bookquote">``I am not such a fool as to mistake what I should be if I left my
husband, and went to live with that man as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mistress. You don't
suppose that I should think that sort of life very blessed. But
why have I been brought to such a pass as this? And, as for female
purity! Ah! What was their idea of purity when they forced me, like
ogres, to marry a man for whom they knew I never cared? Had I gone
with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--had I now eloped with that man who ought to have been my
husband,--whom would a just God have punished worst,--me, or those
two old women and my uncle, who tortured me into this marriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Cora,--be silent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't be silent! You have had the making of your own lot. You have
done what you liked, and no one has interfered with you. You have
suffered, too; but you, at any rate, can respect yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so can you, Cora,--thoroughly, now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How;--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) kissed me, and I could hardly restrain myself from
giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) back his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) kiss tenfold, could I respect myself? But it is
all sin. I sin towards my husband, feigning that I love him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); and
I sin in loving that other man, who should have been my husband.
There;--I hear Mr. Palliser at the door. Come away with me; or rather,
stay, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) will come up here, and you can keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) in talk while I
try to recover myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Palliser did at once as his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife had said, and came up-stairs
to the little front room, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had deposited his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hat in
the hall. Alice was, in fact, in doubt what she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should do, as to
mentioning, or omitting to mention, Mr. Fitzgerald's name. In an
ordinary way, it would be natural that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should name any visitor
who had called, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) specially disliked the idea of remaining
silent because that visitor had come as the lover of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) host's wife.
But, on the other hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) owed much to Lady Glencora; and there
was no imperative reason, as things had gone, why she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should make
mischief. There was no further danger to be apprehended. But Mr.
Palliser at once put an end to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) doubts. <div class="bookquote">``You have had a visitor
here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) as I went out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser. <div class="bookquote">``Indeed, I met him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
at the hall door. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), of course, was wrong to come here;--so wrong,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) deserves punishment, if there were any punishment for such
offences.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) has been punished, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But as for Glencora,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Palliser, without any apparent
notice of what Alice had said, <div class="bookquote">``I thought it better that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) should
see him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) or not, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) should herself decide.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had no choice in the matter. As it turned out, he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was shown up
here at once. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) sent for me, and I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was right to do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Glencora was alone when he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) came in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For a minute or two,--till I could get to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no questions to ask about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser, after
waiting for a few moments. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had probably thought that Alice would
say something further. <div class="bookquote">``I am very glad that you were within reach of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), as otherwise her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) position might have been painful. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), and
for me perhaps, it may be as well that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) has been here. As for him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>),
I can only say, that I am forced to suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) to be a villain. What
a man does when driven by passion, I can forgive; but that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should
deliberately plan schemes to ruin both her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) and me, is what I can
hardly understand.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) made this little speech I wonder whether
his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) conscience said anything to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) about Lady Dumbello, and a
certain evening in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) own life, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had ventured to call
that lady, Griselda.

<p/>The little party of three dined together very quietly, and after
dinner they all went to work with their novels. Before long Alice saw
that Mr. Palliser was yawning, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began to understand how much
he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had given up in order that his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife might be secure. It was then,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had left the room for a few minutes, in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) might
wake himself by walking about the house, that Glencora told Alice of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) yawning down at Matching. <div class="bookquote">``I used to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would fall in
pieces. What are we to do about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't seem to notice it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other; <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll set us off yawning
as bad as himself, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll notice it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has given himself up
to politics, till nothing else has any salt in it left for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I
cannot think why such a man as that wanted a wife at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very hard upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Cora.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you were his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) wife, with all my heart. But, of course, I know
why he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) got married. And I ought to feel for him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) has been so
grievously disappointed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>Then Mr. Palliser having walked off his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
sleep, returned to the room, and the remainder of the evening was
passed in absolute tranquillity.

<p/>Burgo Fitzgerald, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) left the house, turned back into Grosvenor
Square, not knowing, at first, whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) was going. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) took himself
as far as his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) uncle's door, and then, having paused there for a
moment, hurried on. For half an hour, or thereabouts, something like
true feeling was at work within his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had once more pressed
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) bosom the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had, at any rate, thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had
loved. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had had his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and had kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and the tone
with which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had called him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) name was still ringing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>)
ears, <div class="bookquote">``Burgo!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) own name audibly to himself, as though
in this way he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) could recall her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) comforted himself for
a minute with the conviction that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) felt,--for
a moment,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) could live on such consolation as that! But
among mortals there could, in truth, hardly be one with whom such
consolation would go a shorter way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) was a man who required to have
such comfort backed by patés and curaçoa to a very large extent, and
now it might be doubted whether the amount of patés and curaçoa at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) command would last him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) much longer.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) would not go in and tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) aunt at once of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) failure, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>)
could gain nothing by doing so. Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) would not
tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) aunt at all. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) turned back from Grosvenor Square, and
went down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) club in St. James's Street, feeling that billiards
and brandy-and-water might, for the present, be the best restorative.
But, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) went back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) blamed himself very greatly in the matter of
those bank-notes which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had allowed Lady Monk to take from him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>). How
had it come to pass that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) had been such a dupe in her (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) hands? When
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) club in St. James's Street his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) mind had left Lady
Glencora, and was hard at work considering how he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) might best contrive
to get that spoil out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) aunt's possession.




<p/>CHAPTER LXVIII.

<p/>From London to Baden.


<p/>On the following morning everybody was stirring by times at Mr.
Palliser's house in Park Lane, and the master of that house yawned no
more. There is some life in starting for a long journey, and the life
is the stronger and the fuller if the things and people to be carried
are numerous and troublesome. Lady Glencora was a little troublesome,
and would not come down to breakfast in time. When rebuked on account
of this manifest breach of engagement, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) asserted that the next
train would do just as well; and when Mr. Palliser proved to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>),
with much trouble, that the next train could not enable them to
reach Paris on that day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) declared that it would be much more
comfortable to take a week in going than to hurry over the ground in
one day. There was nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) wanted so much as to see Folkestone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If that is the case, why did not you tell me so before?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Palliser, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) gravest voice. <div class="bookquote">``Richard and the carriage went down
yesterday, and are already on board the packet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Richard and the carriage are already on board the packet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said
Lady Glencora, <div class="bookquote">``of course we must follow them, and we must put off
the glories of Folkestone till we come back. Alice, haven't you
observed that, in travelling, you are always driven on by some
Richard or some carriage, till you feel that you are a slave?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/>All this was trying to Mr. Palliser; but I think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) enjoyed it,
nevertheless, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was happy when he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) did get his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
freight off from the Pimlico Station in the proper train.

<p/>Of course Lady Glencora and Alice were very ill crossing the Channel;
of course the two maids were worse than their mistresses; of course
the men kept out of their master's way when they were wanted, and
drank brandy-and-water with the steward down-stairs; and of course
Lady Glencora declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would not allow herself to be carried
beyond Boulogne that day;--but, nevertheless, they did get on to
Paris. Had Mr. Palliser become Chancellor of the Exchequer, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had
once hoped, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could hardly have worked harder than he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) did work. It
was he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) who found out which carriage had been taken for them, and who
put, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) own hands, the ladies' dressing-cases and cloaks on to
the seats,--who laid out the novels, which, of course, were not read
by the road,--and made preparations as though this stage of their
journey was to take them a week, instead of five hours and a half.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear! how I have slept!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, as they came near
to Paris.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you've been tolerably comfortable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser,
joyfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since we got out of that horrid boat I have done pretty well. Why do
they make the boats so nasty? I'm sure they do it on purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be difficult to make them nice, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the sea that makes them uncomfortable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind; we shan't have any more of it for twelve months, at any
rate. We can get to the Kurds, Alice, without getting into a packet
again. That, to my way of thinking, is the great comfort of the
Continent. One can go everywhere without being seasick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Palliser said nothing, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) sighed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) thought of being absent
for a whole year. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had said that such was his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) intention, and would
not at once go back from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) himself had said. But how was he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) to
live for twelve months out of the House of Commons? What was he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) to
do with himself, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) intellect and his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) energy, during all these
coming dreary days? And then,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) might have been Chancellor of the
Exchequer! He (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) might even now, at this very moment, have been upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) legs, making a financial statement of six hours' duration,
to the delight of one-half of the House, and bewilderment of the
other, instead of dragging cloaks across that dingy, dull, dirty
waiting-room at the Paris Station, in which British subjects are kept
in prison while their boxes are being tumbled out of the carriages.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But we are not to stop here;--are we?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora,
mournfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear;--I have given the keys to Richard. We will go on at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But can't we have our things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In about half an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>pleaded Mr. Palliser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose we must bear it, Alice?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) got
into the carriage that was waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>).

<p/>Alice thought of the last time in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been in that
room,--when George and Kate had been with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>),--and the two girls
had been quite content to wait patiently while their trunks were
being examined. But Alice was now travelling with great people,--with
people who never spoke of their wealth, or seemed ever to think of
it, but who showed their consciousness of it at every turn of their
lives. <div class="bookquote">``After all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice had said to herself more than once, <div class="bookquote">``I
doubt whether the burden is not greater than the pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>They stayed in Paris for a week, and during that time Alice found
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) became very intimate with Mr. Palliser. At Matching she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had, in truth, seen but little of him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), and had known nothing. Now
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began to understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) character, and learned how to talk to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) of things in which Lady Glencora
resolutely persisted in taking no interest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) delighted him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) by
writing down in a little pocket-book the number of eggs that were
consumed in Paris every day, whereas Glencora protested that the
information was worth nothing unless her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) how
many of the eggs were good, and how many bad. And Alice was glad
to find that a hundred and fifty thousand female operatives were
employed in Paris, while Lady Glencora said it was a great shame,
and that they ought all to have husbands. When Mr. Palliser explained
that that was impossible, because of the redundancy of the female
population, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) angered him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) very much by asserting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) saw a
great many men walking about who, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was quite sure, had not wives
of their own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do so wish you had married him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Glencora said to Alice that
evening. <div class="bookquote">``You would always have had a pocket-book ready to write down
the figures, and you would have pretended to care about the eggs, and
the bottles of wine, and the rest of it. As for me, I can't do it. If
I see an hungry woman, I can give her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) my money; or if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) be a sick
woman, I can nurse her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); or if I hear of a very wicked man, I can hate
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>);--but I cannot take up poverty and crime in the lump. I never
believe it all. My mind isn't big enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They went into no society at Paris, and at the end of a week were all
glad to leave it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that Baden will be any better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora said;
<div class="bookquote">``but, you know, we can leave that again after a bit,--and so we shall
go on getting nearer to the Kurds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/>To this, Mr. Palliser demurred. <div class="bookquote">``I think we had better make up our
mind to stay a month at Baden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why should we make up our minds at all?''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife pleaded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like to have a plan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so do I,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife,--<div class="bookquote">``if only for the sake of not keeping
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing I hate so much as not carrying out my intentions,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser.

<p/>Upon this, Lady Glencora shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) shoulders, and made a mock
grimace to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) cousin. All this her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband bore for a while meekly,
and it must be acknowledged that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) behaved very well. But, then,
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own way in everything. Lady Glencora did not behave very
well,--contradicting her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband, and not considering, as, perhaps,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) ought to have done, the sacrifice he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was making on her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) behalf.
But, then, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) own way in nothing.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) own way in almost nothing; but on one point she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) did
conquer her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was minded to go from Paris back to Cologne,
and so down the Rhine to Baden. Lady Glencora declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) hated
the Rhine,--that, of all rivers, it was the most distasteful to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>); that, of all scenery, the scenery of the Rhine was the most
over-praised; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would be wretched all the time if she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
were carried that way. Upon this, Mr. Palliser referred the matter
to Alice; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), who had last been upon the Rhine with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
cousins Kate and George Vavasor, voted for going to Baden by way of
Strasbourg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will go by Strasbourg, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser, gallantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not that I want to see that horrid church again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything is alike horrid to you, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband. <div class="bookquote">``You
are determined not to be contented, so that it matters very little
which way we go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``It does matter very little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baden</b></font>)</div><p/>They got on to Baden,--with very little delay at Strasbourg, and
found half an hotel prepared for their reception. Here the carriage
was brought into use for the first time, and the mistress of the
carriage talked of sending home for Dandy and Flirt. Mr. Palliser,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) heard the proposition, calmly assured his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife that the
horses would not bear the journey. <div class="bookquote">``They would be so out of
condition,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``as not to be worth anything for two or three
months.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only meant to ask for them if they could come in a balloon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said
Lady Glencora.

<p/>This angered Mr. Palliser, who had really, for a few minutes, thought
of pacifying his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife by sending for the horses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) asked, one morning, <div class="bookquote">``how many eggs are eaten in Baden
every morning before ten o'clock?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Palliser, who at the moment was in the act of eating one, threw
down his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) spoon, and pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) plate from him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter, Plantagenet?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The matter!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But never mind; I am a fool to care for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I declare I didn't know that I had done anything wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady
Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``Alice, do you understand what it is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did understand very well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) understands,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser. <div class="bookquote">``How can she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) help
it? And, indeed, Miss Vavasor, I am more unhappy than I can express
myself, to think that your comfort should be disturbed in this way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word I think Alice is doing very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.
<div class="bookquote">``What is there to hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) comfort? Nobody scolds her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). Nobody tells
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is a fool. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) never jokes, or does anything wicked,
and, of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) isn't punished.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Palliser, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wandered that day alone through the gambling-rooms
at the great Assembly House, thought that, after all, it might have
been better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) to have remained in London, to have become
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and to have run all risks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether it would be any harm if I were to put a few pieces
of money on the table, just once?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) cousin,
on the evening of the same day, in one of those gambling salons.
There had been some music on that evening in one side of the
building, and the Pallisers had gone to the rooms. But as neither
of the two ladies would dance, they had strayed away into the other
apartments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The greatest harm in the world!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice; <div class="bookquote">``and what on earth
could you gain by it? You don't really want any of those horrid
people's money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what I want,--something to live for,--some excitement.
Is it not a shame that I see around me so many people getting
amusement, and that I can get none? I'd go and sit out there, and
drink beer and hear the music, only Plantagenet wouldn't let me. I
think I'll throw one piece on to the table to see what becomes of
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall leave you if you do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are such a prude! It seems to me as if it must have been my
special fate,--my good fate, I mean,--that has thrown me so much with
you. You look after me quite as carefully as Mr. Bott and Mrs. Marsham
ever did; but as I chose you myself, I can't very well complain, and
I can't very well get rid of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want to get rid of me, Cora?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes. Do you know, there are moments when I almost make up my
mind to go headlong to the devil,--when I think it is the best thing
to be done. It's a hard thing for a woman to do, because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has to
undergo so much obloquy before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gets used to it. A man can take to
drinking, and gambling and all the rest of it, and nobody despises
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a bit. The domestic old fogies give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lectures if they can
catch him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) isn't fool enough for that. All he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants is money,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goes away and has his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fling. Now I have plenty of money,--or,
at any rate, I had,--and I never got my fling yet. I do feel so
tempted to rebel, and go ahead, and care for nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Throwing one piece on to the table wouldn't satisfy that longing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think I should be like the wild beast that has tasted blood,
and can't be controlled. Look at all these people here. There are
husbands gambling, and their wives don't know it; and wives gambling,
and their husbands don't know it. I wonder whether Plantagenet ever
has a fling? What a joke it would be to come and catch him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think you need be afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Afraid! I should like him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) all the better for it. If he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) came to me,
some morning, and told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had lost a hundred thousand pounds,
I should be so much more at my ease with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have no chance in that direction, I'm quite sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None the least. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'d make a calculation that the chances were nine
to seven against him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and then the speculation would seem to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to
be madness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'d wish to try, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) were sure of
winning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not. It would be a very vulgar kind of thing then.
Look,--there's an opening there. I'll just put on one napoleon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall not. If you do, I'll leave you at once. Look at the women
who are playing. Is there one there whom it would not disgrace you to
touch? Look what they are. Look at their cheeks, and their eyes, and
their hands. Those men who rake about the money are bad enough, but
the women look like fiends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not going to frighten me in that hobgoblin sort of way, you
know. I don't see anything the matter with any of the people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think of that young woman who has just got a handful of
money from the man next to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is very happy. I never get money given to me by
handfuls, and the man to whom I belong gives me no encouragement
when I want to amuse myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They were now standing near to one end
of the table, and suddenly there came to be an opening through the
crowd up to the table itself. Lady Glencora, leaving Alice's side, at
once stepped up and deposited a piece of gold on one of the marked
compartments. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) placed it she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) retreated again with
flushed face, and took hold of Alice's arm. <div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``I have done it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Alice, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) dismay, did not know what step to
take. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not scold her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) friend now, as the eyes of many were
turned upon them, nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), of course, leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
threatened. Lady Glencora laughed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) peculiar little low
laughter, and stood her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) ground. <div class="bookquote">``I was determined you shouldn't
frighten me out of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: Lady Glencora at Baden.-RSB-


<p/>One of the ministers at the table had in the meantime gone on with
the cards, and had called the game; and another minister had gently
pushed three or four more pieces of gold up to that which Lady
Glencora had flung down, and had then cunningly caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) eye, and,
with all the courtesy of which he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) was master, had pushed them further
on towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had supposed herself to be unknown there in the
salon, but no doubt all the croupiers and half the company knew well
enough who was the new customer at the table. There was still the
space open, near to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) stood, and then someone motioned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
to come and take up the money which she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had won. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) hesitated, and
then the croupier asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), in that low, indifferent voice which
these men always use, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) desired that her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) money should
remain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) head to him (<font color='blue'><b>customer</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>customer</b></font>) at once drew the money
back again to the spot on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had placed the first napoleon.
Again the cards were turned up softly, again the game was called,
and again she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) won. The money was dealt out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>),--on this occasion
with a full hand. There were lying there between twenty and thirty
napoleons, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was the mistress. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) face had flushed
before, but now it became very red. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) caught hold of Alice, who was
literally trembling beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and tried to laugh again. But there
was that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eye which told Alice that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was really frightened.
Some one then placed a chair for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) at the table, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
confusion, not knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was to do, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) seated herself. <div class="bookquote">``Come
away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, taking hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and disregarding everything
but her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own purpose, in the agony of the moment. <div class="bookquote">``You must come
away! You shall not sit there!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I must get rid of that money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said
Glencora, trying to whisper her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) words, <div class="bookquote">``and then I will come away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>The croupier again asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) if the money was to remain, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
again nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) head. Everybody at the table was now looking at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>). The women especially were staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>),--those horrid women
with vermilion cheeks, and loud bonnets half off their heads, and
hard, shameless eyes, and white gloves, which, when taken off in the
ardour of the game, disclosed dirty hands. They stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) with
that fixed stare which such women have, and Alice saw it all, and
trembled.

<p/>Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) won. <div class="bookquote">``Leave it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, <div class="bookquote">``and come away.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't
leave it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``If I do, there'll be a fuss. I'll go
the next time.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>What she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said was, of course, in English, and was
probably understood by no one near her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>); but it was easy to be seen
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was troubled, and, of course, those around her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) looked at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) the more because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) trouble. Again that little question and
answer went on between her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) and the croupier, and on this occasion
the money was piled up on the compartment--a heap of gold which made
envious the hearts of many who stood around there. Alice had now
both her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hands on the back of the chair, needing support. If the
devil should persist, and increase that stock of gold again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
must go and seek for Mr. Palliser. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew not what else to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
understood nothing of the table, or of its laws; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) supposed
all those ministers of the game to be thieves, and believed that
all villainous contrivances were within their capacity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought
that they might go on adding to that heap so long as Lady Glencora
would sit there, presuming that they might thus get her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) into their
clutches. Of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) did not sift her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) suspicions. Who does at
such moments? <div class="bookquote">``Come away at once, and leave it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``or I
shall go.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>At that moment the croupier raked it all up, and carried
it all away; but Alice did not see that this had been done. A hand
had been placed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) shoulder, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) turned round her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes met those of Mr. Palliser. <div class="bookquote">``It is all gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Glencora,
laughing. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), turning round, also saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband. <div class="bookquote">``I am so
glad that you are come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``Why did you bring her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser. There was anger in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) tone, and anger in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) eye.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife's arm upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) own, and walked away quickly, while
Alice followed them alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) went off at once, down the front steps
of the building, towards the hotel. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife, Alice
did not hear; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heart was swelling with the ill-usage to which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) herself was subjected. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might have to go back alone
to England, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was ill-treating her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) on, up into their drawing-room, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) stood with
the door open in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hand for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), while Lady Glencora threw herself
upon a sofa, and burst out into affected laughter. <div class="bookquote">``Here's a piece of
work,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``about a little accident.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An accident!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, an accident. You don't suppose that I sat down there meaning to
win all that money?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Whereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) with scorn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Palliser,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, <div class="bookquote">``you have treated me this evening in a
manner I did not expect from you. It is clear that you blame me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not said a word, Miss Vavasor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; you have not said a word. You know well how to show your anger
without speaking. As I do not choose to undergo your displeasure, I
will return to England by myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice! Alice!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Glencora, jumping up, <div class="bookquote">``that is nonsense! What
is all this trumpery thing about? Leave me, because he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) chooses to be
angry about nothing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it nothing that I find my wife playing at a common
gambling-table, surrounded by all that is wretched and
vile,--established there, seated, with heaps of gold before her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wrong me, Plantagenet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``There was only one heap,
and that did not remain long. Did it, Alice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is impossible to make you ashamed of anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly don't like being ashamed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) answered; <div class="bookquote">``and don't feel
any necessity on this occasion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you don't object, Mr. Palliser,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, <div class="bookquote">``I will go to bed.
You can think over all this at night,--and so can I. Good night,
Glencora.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Then Alice took her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) candle, and marched off to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own
room, with all the dignity of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was mistress.




<p/>CHAPTER LXIX.

<p/>From Baden to Lucerne.


<p/>The second week in July saw Mr. Palliser's party, carriage and all,
established at Lucerne, in Switzerland, safe beyond the reach of
the German gambling tables. Alice Vavasor was still with them; and
the reader will therefore understand that that quarrel about Lady
Glencora's wickedness had been settled without any rupture. It had
been settled amicably, and by the time that they had reached Lucerne,
Alice was inclined to acknowledge that the whole thing was not worth
notice; but for many days her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) anger against Mr. Palliser had not been
removed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) intimacy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had been much checked. It was now
a month since the occurrence of that little scene in the salon at
Baden, which was described in the last chapter,--since Mr. Palliser
had marched off with his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife, leaving Alice to follow as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) best
could by herself. After that, as the reader may remember, he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had
almost told her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was to be blamed because of his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) wife's
indiscretion; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) intention of leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>),
and making her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) way home to England by herself, he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
not at all, and had allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to go off to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own room under the
full ban of his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) displeasure. Since that he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had made no apology to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had not, in so many words, acknowledged that he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had wronged
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>); but Alice had become aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) intended to apologize by his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
conduct, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been content so far to indulge his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) obstinacy as
to accept this conduct on his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) part in lieu of any outspoken petition
for pardon. The acknowledgement of a mistake and the asking for grace
is almost too much for any woman to expect from such a man as Mr.
Palliser.

<p/>Early on the morning after the scene in question, Lady Glencora
had gone into Alice's bedroom, and had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
dressing-gown, packing up her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) things, or looking as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
intended to do so. <div class="bookquote">``You are not such a fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``as to think
anything of what occurred yesterday?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Alice assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that, whether
fool or not, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did think a great deal of it. <div class="bookquote">``In point of fact,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, <div class="bookquote">``I can't stand it. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) expects me to take care of you, and
chooses to show himself offended if you don't do just what he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) thinks
proper; whereas, as you know well enough, I have not the slightest
influence over you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>All these positions Lady Glencora contradicted
vigorously. Of course, Mr. Palliser had been wrong in walking out
of the Assembly Rooms as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had done, leaving Alice behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). So
much Lady Glencora admitted. But this had come of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) intense anxiety.
<div class="bookquote">``And you know what a man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife--<div class="bookquote">``how stiff, and hard,
and unpleasant he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can be without meaning it.'' (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``There is no reason
why I should bear his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unpleasantness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, there
is,--great reason. You are to do it for the sake of friendship. And
as for my not doing what you tell me, you know that's not true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I not beg you to keep away from the table?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you did, and of course I was naughty; but that was only
once. Alice, I want you more than I ever wanted you before. I cannot
tell you more now, but you must stay with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice consented to come down to breakfast without any immediate
continuance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) active preparations for going, and at last, of
course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) stayed. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) entered the breakfast-room Mr. Palliser
came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had no alternative
but to take it, and then seated herself. That there was an intended
apology in the manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) toast and butter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
was convinced; and the special courtesy with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to
the carriage, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) and Lady Glencora went out for their drive,
after dinner, was almost as good as a petition for pardon. So the
thing went on, and by degrees Mr. Palliser and Miss Vavasor were again
friends.

<p/>But Alice never knew in what way the matter was settled between
Mr. Palliser and his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife, or whether there was any such settling.
Probably there was none. <div class="bookquote">``Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) understands that it didn't
mean anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora had said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) knows that I don't want
to gamble.''  (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div>But let that be as it might, their sojourn at Baden was
curtailed, and none of the party went up again to the Assembly Rooms
before their departure.

<p/>Before establishing themselves at Lucerne they made a little tour
round by the Falls of the Rhine and Zurich. In their preparations
for this journey, Alice made a struggle, but a struggle in vain, to
avoid a passage through Basle. It was only too clear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that Mr.
Palliser was determined to go by Basle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not bring herself
to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had recollections connected with that place which
would make a return to it unpleasant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could have
said as much, even to Glencora, Mr. Palliser would no doubt have
gone round,--round by any more distant route that might have been
necessary to avoid that eternal gateway into Switzerland. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
could not say it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was very averse to talking about herself and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own affairs, even with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin. Of course Lady Glencora knew
the whole story of Mr. John Grey and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) rejection,--and knew much
also of that other story of Mr. George Vavasor. And, of course, like
all Alice's friends, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hated George Vavasor, and was prepared to
receive Mr. John Grey with open arms, if there were any possibility
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin would open her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) arms to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) also. But Alice was so
stubborn about her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own affairs that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) friend found it almost
impossible to speak of them. <div class="bookquote">``It is not that you trouble me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice
once said, <div class="bookquote">``but that you trouble yourself about that which is of no
use. It is all done and over; and though I know that I have behaved
badly,--very badly,--yet I believe that everything has been done for
the best. I am inclined to think that I can live alone, or perhaps
with my cousin Kate, more happily than I could with any husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is such nonsense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps so; but, at any rate, I mean to try. We Vavasors don't seem
to be good at marrying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You want some one to break your heart for you; that's what you
want,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. In saying this she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) knew but little of
the state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) friend's heart, and perhaps was hardly capable
of understanding it. With all the fuss that Lady Glencora made to
herself,--with all the tears that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had shed about her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) lost lover,
and was so often shedding,--with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) continual thinking of the
matter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had never loved Burgo Fitzgerald as Alice Vavasor had
loved Mr. Grey. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) nature was altogether different to that of
Alice. Love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had in it a gleam of poetry, a spice of fun,
a touch of self-devotion, something even of hero-worship; but with
it all there was a dash of devilry, and an aptitude almost for
wickedness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew Burgo Fitzgerald to be a scapegrace, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) the better on that account. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) despised her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) husband
because he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had no vices. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would have given everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
to Burgo,--pouring her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wealth upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) with a total disregard of
herself, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) been allowed to do so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would have forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
sin after sin, and might perhaps have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) round, at last, to
some life not absolutely reckless and wretched. But in all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
might have done, there would have been no thoughtfulness,--no true
care either for him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) or for herself. And now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was married
there was no thoughtfulness, or care either for herself or for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was ready to sacrifice herself for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), if any sacrifice
might be required of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) believed herself to be unfit for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),
and would have submitted to be divorced,--or smothered out of the
way, for the matter of that,--if the laws of the land would have
permitted it. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had never for a moment given to herself the
task of thinking what conduct on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) part might be the best for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
welfare.

<p/>But Alice's love had been altogether of another kind,--and I am by no
means sure that it was better suited for the work of this work-a-day
world than that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin. It was too thoughtful. I will not
say that there was no poetry in it, but I will say that it lacked
romance. Its poetry was too hard for romance. There was certainly
in it neither fun nor wickedness; nor was there, I fear, so large
a proportion of hero-worship as there always should be in a girl's
heart when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gives it away. But there was in it an amount
of self-devotion which none of those near to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had hitherto
understood,--unless it were that one to whom the understanding of it
was of the most importance. In all the troubles of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) love, of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
engagements, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) broken promises, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had thought more of others
than of herself,--and, indeed, those troubles had chiefly come from
that self-devotion. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had left John Grey because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feared that
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would do him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) no good as his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) wife,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would not make him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
happy; and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had afterwards betrothed herself for a second time to
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cousin, because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could serve him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) by marrying
him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been wrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been very wrong to give up
the man she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did love, and more wrong again in suggesting to herself
the possibility of marrying the man she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not love. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew that
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been wrong in both, and was undergoing repentance with very
bitter inward sackcloth. But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said little of all this even to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
cousin.

<p/>They went to Lucerne by Basle, and put up at the big hotel with the
balcony over the Rhine, which Alice remembered so well. On the first
evening of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) arrival she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found herself again looking down upon the
river, as though it might have been from the same spot which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
occupied together with George and Kate. But, in truth, that house is
very large, and has many bedrooms over the water. Who has ever been
through Basle, and not stood in one of them, looking down upon the
father of waters? Here, on this very spot, in one of these balconies,
was brought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) a letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cousin Kate, which was filled
with tidings respecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cousin George. Mr. Palliser brought it to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) own hands, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had no other alternative but to read
it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) presence. <div class="bookquote">``George has lost his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) election,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the letter began.
For one moment Alice thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) money, and the vain struggle
in which it had been wasted. For one moment, something like regret
for the futility of the effort she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had made came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). But it
passed away at once. <div class="bookquote">``It was worth our while to try it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to
herself, and then went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) letter. <div class="bookquote">``I and Aunt Greenow are up
in London,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the letter went on to say, ``and have just heard the news.
Though I have been here for three days, and have twice sent word to
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to say so, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has not been near me. Perhaps it is best that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
should stay away, as I do not know how any words could pass between
us that would be pleasant. The poll was finished this afternoon, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) election by a large majority. There were five candidates
altogether for the two seats--three Liberals, and two Conservatives.
The other two Liberals were seated, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was the last of the five.
I continue to hear tidings about him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) from day to day,--or rather, my
aunt hears them and tells them to me, which fill me full of fears as
to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) future career. I believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has abandoned his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) business,
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has now no source of income. I would willingly share what
I have with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>); or I would do more than that. After keeping back
enough to repay you gradually what he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) owes you, I would give him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) all
my share of the income out of the estate. But I cannot do this while
we are presumed to be enemies. I am up here to see a lawyer as to
some steps which he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) is taking to upset grandpapa's will. The lawyer
says that it is all nonsense, and that George's lawyer is not really
in earnest; but I cannot do anything till the matter is settled. Dear
Alice, though so much of your money is for a time gone, I am bound to
congratulate you on your safety,--on what I may more truly call your
escape. You will understand what my own feelings must be in writing
this, after all that I did to bring you and him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) together,--after all
my hopes and ambition respecting him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>). As for the money, it shall be
repaid. I do not think I shall ever dare to indulge in any strong
desire again. I think you will forgive me the injury I have done
you;--and I know that you will pity me.

<p/>``I am here to see the London lawyer,--but not only for that. Aunt
Greenow is buying her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) wedding clothes, and Captain Bellfield is in
lodgings near to us, also buying his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) trousseau; or, as I should
more properly say, having it bought for him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). I am hardly in a mood
for much mirth, but it is impossible not to laugh inwardly when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) discusses before me the state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) wardrobe, and proposes
economical arrangements--greatly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) disgust. At present, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>)
holds him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) very tightly in hand, and makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) account for all his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
hours as well as all his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) money. ``Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)'ll run wild directly
he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)'s married,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to me, yesterday; `and, of course, there'll
always be a fight about it; but the more I do to tame him (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) now, the
less wild he (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'ll be by-and-by. And though I dare say, I shall scold
him (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sometimes, I shall never quarrel with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I have no doubt all
that is true; but what a fool she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is to trouble herself with such a
man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) does it for an occupation. I took courage to tell
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) once that a caged tiger would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) as much to do, and be less
dangerous. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was angry at this, and answered me very sharply. I had
tried my hand on a tiger, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, and had felt his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) claws. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) chose
to sacrifice herself,--if a sacrifice it were to be,--when some good
result might be possible. I had nothing further to say; and from that
time to this we have been on the pleasantest terms possible as to the
Captain. They have settled with your father to take Vavasor Hall for
three years, and I suppose I shall stay with them till your return.
What I may do then will depend entirely upon your doings. I feel
myself to be a desolate, solitary being, without any tie to any
person, or to any place. I never thought that I should feel the death
of my grandfather to be such a loss to me as it has been. Except you,
I have nothing left to me; and, as regards you, I have the unpleasant
feeling that I have for years been endeavouring to do you the worst
possible injury, and that you must regard me as an enemy from whom
you have escaped indeed, but not without terrible wounds.''

<p/>Alice was always angered by any assumption that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) conduct to Mr.
Grey had been affected by the advice or influence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin Kate.
But this very feeling seemed to preserve Kate from the worse anger,
which might have been aroused against her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), had Alice acknowledged the
injury which her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin had in truth done to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). It was undoubtedly
true that had Alice neither seen nor heard from Kate during the
progress of John Grey's courtship, John Grey would not have lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
wife. But against this truth Alice was always protesting within her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
own breast. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been weak, foolish, irresolute,--and had finally
acted with false judgement. So much she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) now admitted to herself. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would not admit that any other woman had persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to such
weakness. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) mistakes me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice thought, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) put up her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) letter.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) is not the enemy who has wounded me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Palliser, who had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) the letter, was seated in the same
balcony, and while Alice had been reading, had almost buried himself
in newspapers which conveyed intelligence as to the general elections
then in progress. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was now seated with a sheet of _The Times_ in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hand, opened to its full extent,--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had been too impatient
to cut the paper,--and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) held it up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hands before his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) eyes,
was completely hidden beneath it. Five or six other open papers were
around him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had not spoken a word since he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had commenced his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
present occupation. Lady Glencora was standing on the other side of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) also had received letters. <div class="bookquote">``Sophy tells me that you are
returned for Silverbridge,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who? I! yes; I'm returned,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser, speaking with
something like disdain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) voice as to the possibility of anybody
having stood with a chance of success against him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) own family
borough. For a full appreciation of the advantages of a private seat
in the House of Commons let us always go to those great Whig families
who were mainly instrumental in carrying the Reform Bill. The house
of Omnium had been very great on that occasion. It had given up
much, and had retained for family use simply the single seat at
Silverbridge. But that that seat should be seriously disputed hardly
suggested itself as possible to the mind of any Palliser. The
Pallisers and the other great Whig families have been right in this.
They have kept in their hands, as rewards for their own services to
the country, no more than the country is manifestly willing to give
them. <div class="bookquote">``Yes; I have been returned,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry to
see, Miss Vavasor, that your cousin has not been so fortunate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I find,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``It will be a great misfortune to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I suppose so. Those Metropolitan elections cost so much trouble
and so much money, and under the most favourable circumstances, are
so doubtful. A man is never sure there till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has fought for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
seat three or four times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This has been the third time with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a
poor man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser, who himself knew nothing of such
misfortunes. <div class="bookquote">``I have always thought that those seats should be
left to rich commercial men who can afford to spend money upon them.
Instead of that, they are generally contested by men of moderate
means. Another of my friends in the House has been thrown out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is that unfortunate?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>asked Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bott,''  (<font color='red'><b>the husband</b></font>)</div>said the unthinking husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bott out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bott thrown out! I am so
glad. Alice, are you not glad? The red-haired man, that used to stand
about, you know, at Matching;--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has lost his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seat in Parliament. I
suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll go and stand about somewhere in Lancashire, now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>A woman</b></font>)</div><p/>A very indiscreet woman was poor Lady Glencora. Mr. Palliser's face
became black beneath _The Times_ newspaper. <div class="bookquote">``I did not know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that my friend Mr. Bott and Miss Vavasor were enemies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Enemies! I don't suppose they were enemies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>)
was a man whom no one could help observing,--and disliking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) was a man I specially disliked,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, with great courage.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) may be very well in Parliament; but I never met a man who could
make himself so disagreeable in society. I really did feel myself
constrained to be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enemy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bravo, Alice!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did nothing at Matching, to--to--to--,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>began Mr. Palliser,
apologetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing especially to offend me, Mr. Palliser,--except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had
a way that I especially dislike of trying to make little secret
confidences.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was so ugly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I felt certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) endeavoured to do mischief,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora; <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had a habit of
rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) head against the papers in the rooms, and leaving a mark
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) that was quite unpardonable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Palliser was effectually talked down, and felt himself constrained
to abandon his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) political ally. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) did this the easier as the
loss which Mr. Bott had just suffered would materially interfere with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) political utility. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) will remain now among his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) own
people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora,--<div class="bookquote">``and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) own people
will appreciate the advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) presence.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Then there was
nothing more said about Mr. Bott.

<p/>It was evening, and while they were still sitting among their letters
and newspapers, there came a shout along the water, and the noise of
many voices from the bridge. Suddenly, there shot down before them
in the swift running stream the heads of many swimmers in the river,
and with the swimmers came boats carrying their clothes. They went
by almost like a glance of light upon the waters, so rapid was the
course of the current. There was the shout of voices,--the quick
passage of the boats,--the uprising, some half a dozen times, of
the men's hands above the surface; and then they were gone down the
river, out of sight,--like morsels of wood thrown into a cataract,
which are borne away instantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how I wish I could do that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to be very dangerous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know how
they can stop themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should they want to stop themselves?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``Think
how cool the water must be, and how beautiful to be carried along so
quickly, and to go on, and on, and on! I suppose we couldn't try it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/>As no encouragement was given to this proposition, Lady Glencora did
not repeat it; but stood leaning on the rail of the balcony, and
looking enviously down upon the water. Alice was, of course, thinking
of that other evening, when perhaps the same swimmers had come down
under the bridge and before the balcony, and where George Vavasor was
sitting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) presence. It was, I think, on that evening, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mind to separate herself from Mr. Grey.

<p/>On the day after that, Mr. Palliser and his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) party went on to
Lucerne, making that journey, as I have said, by slow stages; taking
Schaffhausen and Zurich in their way. At Lucerne, they established
themselves for some time, occupying nearly a dozen rooms in the great
hotel which overlooks the lake. Here there came to them a visitor, of
whose arrival I will speak in the next chapter.




<p/>CHAPTER LXX.

<p/>At Lucerne.


<p/>I am inclined to think that Mr. Palliser did not much enjoy this
part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) tour abroad. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) first reached Lucerne there was no
one there with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could associate pleasantly, nor had he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) any
occupation capable of making his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) time run easily. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) did not care for
scenery. Close at his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) elbow was the finest to be had in Europe; but
it was nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) been simply journeying through Lucerne
at the proper time of the year for such a journey, when the business
of the Session was over, and a little change of air needed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could
have enjoyed the thing in a moderate way, looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), passing
on, and knowing that it was good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) to be there at that moment.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had none of that passion for mountains and lakes, none of
that positive joy in the heather, which would have compensated many
another man for the loss of all that Mr. Palliser was losing. His (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) mind
was ever at home in the House of Commons, or in that august assembly
which men call the Cabinet, and of the meetings of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) read from
week to week the simple records. Therein were mentioned the names of
those heroes to whom Fortune had been so much kinder than she (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had
been to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) envied them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) took short, solitary walks, about
the town, over the bridges, and along the rivers, making to himself
the speeches which he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would have made to full houses, had not his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
wife brought ruin upon all his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hopes. And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) pictured to himself
the glorious successes which probably never would have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had
he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) remained in London, so did he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) prophesy to himself an absolute and
irremediable downfall from all political power as the result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
absence,--having, in truth, no sufficient cause for such despair. As
yet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was barely thirty, and had he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) been able to judge his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) own case
as keenly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could have judged the case of another, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would have
known that a short absence might probably raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) value in the
estimation of others rather than lower it. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) personal annoyance
was too great to allow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) making such calculations aright. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
became fretful and unhappy; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) spoke no word of rebuke
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) never hinted that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
glories, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) conscious by his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) manner that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
to this miserable condition.

<p/>Lady Glencora herself had a love for the mountains and lakes, but it
was a love of that kind which requires to be stimulated by society,
and which is keenest among cold chickens, picnic-pies, and the flying
of champagne corks. When they first entered Switzerland she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was very
enthusiastic, and declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) intention of climbing up all the
mountains, and going through all the passes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) endeavoured to
induce her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband to promise that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) should be taken up Mont Blanc.
And I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would have carried this on, and would have been taken
up Mont Blanc, had Mr. Palliser's aspirations been congenial. But they
were not congenial, and Lady Glencora soon lost all her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) enthusiasm.
By the time that they were settled at Lucerne she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had voted the
mountains to be bores, and had almost learned to hate the lake, which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) declared always made her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) wet through when she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) got into a small
boat, and sea-sick when she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) foot in a large one. At Lucerne
they made no acquaintances, Mr. Palliser being a man not apt to new
friendships. They did not even dine at the public table, though Lady
Glencora had expressed a wish to do so. Mr. Palliser did not like it,
and of course Lady Glencora gave way. There were, moreover, some
marital passages which were not pleasant to a third person. They did
not scold each other; but Lady Glencora would make little speeches of
which her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband disapproved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would purposely irritate him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) by
continuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) tone of badinage, and then Mr. Palliser would become
fretful, and would look as though the cares of the world were too
many for him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). I cannot, therefore, say that Alice had much to make
the first period of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sojourn at Lucerne a period of enjoyment.

<p/>But when they had been there about a fortnight, a stranger arrived,
whose coming at any rate lent the grace of some excitement to their
lives. Their custom was to breakfast at nine,--or as near nine as
Lady Glencora could be induced to appear,--and then Mr. Palliser would
read till three. At that hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would walk forth by himself, after
having handed the two ladies into their carriage, and they would
be driven about for two hours. <div class="bookquote">``How I do hate this carriage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady
Glencora said one day. <div class="bookquote">``I do so wish it would come to grief, and be
broken to pieces. I wonder whether the Swiss people think that we are
going to be driven about here for ever.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>There were moments, however,
which seemed to indicate that Lady Glencora had something to tell
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) cousin, which, if told, would alter the monotony of their lives.
Alice, however, would not press her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) secret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you have anything to tell, why don't you tell it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice once
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are so hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you tell me very often,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice replied; <div class="bookquote">``and it is not
complimentary. But hard or soft, I won't make a petition for your
confidence.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Then Lady Glencora said something savage, and the
subject was dropped for a while.

<p/>But we must go back to the stranger. Mr. Palliser had put the ladies
into their carriage, and was standing between the front door of the
hotel and the lake on a certain day, doubting whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would walk
up the hill to the left or turn into the town on the right, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
was accosted by an English gentleman, who, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hat, said that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) spoke to Mr. Palliser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am Mr. Palliser,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>said our friend, very courteously, returning the
salute, and smiling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) spoke. But though he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) smiled, and though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was courteous, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hat, there was something
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) look and voice which would not have encouraged any ordinary
stranger to persevere. Mr. Palliser was not a man with whom it was
easy to open an acquaintance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My name is John Grey,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said the stranger.

<p/>Then the smile was dropped, the look of extreme courtesy disappeared,
the tone of Mr. Palliser's voice was altered, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) knew enough of Mr. John Grey's history to be aware that
Mr. John Grey was a man with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) might permit himself to become
acquainted. After the interchange of a very few words, the two men
started off for a walk together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you don't wish to meet the carriage?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser. <div class="bookquote">``If
so, we had better go through the town and up the river.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/>They went through the town, and up the river, and when Mr. Palliser,
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) return, was seen by Alice and Lady Glencora, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was alone.
They dined together, and nothing was said. Together they sauntered
out in the evening, and together came in and drank their tea; but
still nothing was said. At last, Alice and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin took their
candles from Mr. Palliser's hands and left the sitting-room for the
night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, as soon as they were in the passage
together, <div class="bookquote">``I have been dying for this time to come. I could not speak
before, or I should have made blunders, and so would you. Let us go
into your room at once. Who do you think is here, at Lucerne, in this
house, at this very moment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice knew at once who it was. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew, immediately, that Mr. Grey
had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), though no word had been written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) or spoken to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) on the subject since that day on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) himself had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
that they would meet abroad. But though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was quite sure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did
not mention his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) name. <div class="bookquote">``Who is it, Glencora?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) asked, very calmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whom in all the world would you best like to see?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My cousin Kate, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it is not your cousin Kate. And I don't believe you;--or else
you're a fool.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice was accustomed to Lady Glencora's mode of talking, and
therefore did not think much of this. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I am a fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only I know you are not. But I am not at all so sure as to your
being no hypocrite. The person I mean is a gentleman, of course. Why
don't you show a little excitement, at any rate? When Plantagenet
told me, just before dinner, I almost jumped out of my shoes. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was
going to tell you himself after dinner, in the politest way in the
world, no doubt, and just as the servants were carrying away the
apples. I thought it best to save you from that; but, I declare, I
believe I might have left him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to do it; it would have had no effect
upon you. Who is it that has come, do you suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I know now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, very calmly, <div class="bookquote">``that Mr. John Grey
has come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. John Grey has come. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) is here in this house at this
minute;--or, more probably, waiting outside by the lake till he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) shall
see a light in your bedroom.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Then Lady Glencora paused for a moment,
waiting that Alice might say something. But Alice said nothing.
<div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, rising up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you nothing to say? Is it the same to you as though Mr. Smith
had come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not exactly the same. I am quite alive to the importance of Mr.
Grey's arrival, and shall probably lie awake all night thinking about
it,--if it will do you any good to know that; but I don't feel that I
have much to say about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I had let Mr. Palliser tell you, in an ordinary way, before
all the servants. I do indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would not have made much difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not the least, I believe. I wonder whether you ever did care for
anybody in your life,--for him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), or for that other one, or for
anybody. For nobody, I believe;--except your cousin Kate. Still
waters, they say, run deep; and sometimes I think your waters run
too deep for me to fathom. I suppose I may go now, if you have got
nothing more to say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want me to say? Of course I know why he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) has come here.
He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) told me he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) should come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have never said a word about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) told me he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) should come, and I thought it better not to say a word
about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) might change his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) mind, or anything might happen. I told
him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) not to come; and it would have been much better that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) should
have remained away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why;--why;--why would it be better?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) being here will do no good to any one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No good! It seems to me impossible but that it should do all the
good in the world. Look here, Alice. If you do not altogether make
it up with him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) before to-morrow evening, I shall believe you to be
utterly heartless. Had I been you I should have been in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) arms
before this. I'll go now, and leave you to lie awake, as you say
you will.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) left the room, but returned in a moment to ask
another question. <div class="bookquote">``What is Plantagenet to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) about seeing you
to-morrow? Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) has asked permission to come and call.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) may come if he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) pleases. You don't think I have quarrelled with
him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), or would refuse to see him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And may we ask him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) to dine with us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And make up a picnic, and all the rest of it. In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is to
be regarded as only an ordinary person. Well;--good night. I don't
understand you, that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>It may be doubted whether Alice understood herself. As soon as her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
friend was gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) candle and seated herself at the
open window of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) room, looking out upon the moonlight as it played
upon the lake. Would he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) be there, thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), looking up,
perhaps, as Glencora had hinted, to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could distinguish her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
light among the hundred that would be flickering across the long
front of the house. If it were so, at any rate he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>),
so she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) drew the curtain, and sat there watching the lake. It was
a pity that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should have come, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) dearly for
coming. It was a pity that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should have come, as his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) coming could
lead to no good result. Of this she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) assured herself over and over
again, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) hardly knew why she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was so sure of it. Glencora
had called her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) hard; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) conviction on that matter had not come
from hardness. Now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was alone, her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) heart was full of love, of
the soft romance of love towards this man; and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
ought not to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), even though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might still be willing to take
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>). That he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was still willing to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desired to have
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife in spite of all the injury she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had done him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), there
could be no doubt. Why else had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) to Switzerland? And
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) remembered, now at this moment, how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) at Cheltenham
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would never consider her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) to be lost to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
should, in truth, become the wife of another man. Why, then, should
it not be as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wished it?


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: Alice.-RSB-


<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) asked herself the question, and did not answer it; but still she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
felt that it might not be so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had no right to such happiness
after the evil that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had done. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been driven by a frenzy to
do that which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) herself could not pardon; and having done it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
could not bring herself to accept the position which should have been
the reward of good conduct. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not analyse the causes which
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) must still refuse the love that was proffered
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not clearly read her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own thoughts; but the causes
were as I have said, and such was the true reading of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thoughts.
Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) simply refused his (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand after she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had once accepted it,--had
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) refused it, and then again changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could have
brought herself to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had done so much
more than this, and so much worse! She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had affianced herself to
another man since she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--since she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) future wife. What must he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and what not
suspect? Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) remembered those interviews which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had had with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin since she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had written to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), accepting his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) offer. When
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had been with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in Queen Anne Street she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had shrunk from all
outward signs of a love which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not feel. There had been no
caress between them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had not allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) to touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
lips. But it was impossible that the nature of that mad engagement
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin George should ever be made known to Mr.
Grey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat there wiping the tears from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked for
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) figure among the figures by the lake-side; but, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat there,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) promised herself no happiness from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) coming. Oh! reader, can
you forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had sinned against the softness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
feminine nature? I think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) may be forgiven, in that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
never brought herself to think lightly of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own fault.

<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) were there, by the lake-side, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not see him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). I think we
may say that John Grey was not a man to console himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) love
by looking up at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) lady's candle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was one who was capable of
doing as much as most men in the pursuit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) love,--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) proved
to be the case when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) followed Alice to Cheltenham, and again to
London, and now again to Lucerne; but I doubt whether a glimmer from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) bedroom-window, had it been unmistakably her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own glimmer, and not
that of some ugly old French woman who might chance to sleep next to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), would have done him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) much good. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had come to Lucerne with a
purpose, which purpose, if it might be possible, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) meant to carry
out; but I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was already in bed, being tired with long travel,
before Lady Glencora had left Alice's room.

<p/>At breakfast the next morning nothing was said for a while about the
new arrival. At last Mr. Palliser ventured to speak. <div class="bookquote">``Glencora has
told you, I think, that Mr. Grey is here? Mr. Grey is an old friend of
yours, I believe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice, keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) countenance as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was able, said Mr. Grey
had been, and, indeed, was, a very dear friend of hers. Mr. Palliser
knew the whole story, and what was the use of any little attempt at
dissimulation? <div class="bookquote">``I shall be glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>),--if you will allow me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Glencora suggests that we should ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) to dinner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Palliser; and then that matter was settled.

<p/>But Mr. Grey did not wait till dinner-time to see Alice. Early in the
morning his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) card was brought up, and Lady Glencora, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
saw the name, immediately ran away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed you need not go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I shall go,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ladyship. <div class="bookquote">``I know what's proper on
these occasions, if you don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went, whisking herself along the passages with a little run;
and Mr. Grey, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was shown into her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ladyship's usual sitting-room,
saw the skirt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ladyship's dress as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) whisked herself off
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you I should come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ordinary sweet smile.
<div class="bookquote">``I told you that I should follow you, and here I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand, and held it, pressing it warmly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hardly knew
with what words first to address him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), or how to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand back
from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad to see you,--as an old friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but I
hope--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--you hope what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you have had some better cause for travelling than a desire
to see me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dearest; no. I have had no better cause, and, indeed, none
other. I have come on purpose to see you; and had Mr. Palliser
taken you off to Asia or Africa, I think I should have felt myself
compelled to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). You know why I follow you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hardly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),--not finding at the moment any other word that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I love you. You see what a plain-spoken John Bull I am, and
how I come to the point at once. I want you to be my wife; and they
say that perseverance is the best way when a man has such a want as
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought not to want it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, whispering the words as though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) were unable to speak them out loud.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do, you see. And why should I not want it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not fit to be your wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am the best judge of that, Alice. You have to make up your mind
whether I am fit to be your husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would be disgraced if you were to take me, after all that has
passed;--after what I have done. What would other men say of you when
they knew the story?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Other men, I hope, would be just enough to say, that when I had made
up my mind, I was tolerably constant in keeping to it. I do not think
they could say much worse of me than that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They would say that you had been jilted, and had forgiven the jilt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As far as the forgiveness goes, they would tell the truth. But,
indeed, Alice, I don't very much care what men do say of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I care, Mr. Grey;--and though you may forgive me, I cannot
forgive myself. Indeed I know now, as I have known all along, that
I am not fit to be your wife. I am not good enough. And I have done
that which makes me feel that I have no right to marry anyone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>These words she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, jerking out the different sentences almost in
convulsions; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had come to the end of them, the tears
were streaming down her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cheeks. <div class="bookquote">``I have thought about it, and I
will not. I will not. After what has passed, I know that it will be
better,--more seemly, that I should remain as I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Soon after that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), not, however, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would meet him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) again at dinner, and had begged him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to treat
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) simply as a friend. <div class="bookquote">``In spite of everything, I hope that we may
always be friends,--dear friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope we may,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) answered;--<div class="bookquote">``the very dearest.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) left
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).

<p/>In the afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) again encountered Mr. Palliser, and having thought
over the matter since his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) interview with Alice, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) resolved to tell
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) whole story to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) new acquaintance,--not in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might
ask for counsel from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), for in this matter he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wanted no man's
advice,--but that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might get some assistance. So the two men
walked off together, up the banks of the clear-flowing Reuss, and Mr.
Palliser felt the comfort of having a companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have always liked her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser, <div class="bookquote">``though, to tell the
truth, I have twice been very angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never been angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the lover</b></font>)</div>said the lover.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And my anger was in both instances unjust. You may imagine how
great is my confidence in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), when I have thought she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was the
best companion my wife could have for a long journey, taken under
circumstances that were--that were--; but I need not trouble you with
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/>So great had been the desolation of Mr. Palliser's life since his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
banishment from London that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) almost felt tempted to tell the story
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) troubles to this absolute stranger. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) bethought himself
of the blood of the Pallisers, and refrained. There are comforts
which royalty may never enjoy, and luxuries in which such men as
Plantagenet Palliser may not permit themselves to indulge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) character I have no doubt in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said
Grey. <div class="bookquote">``In all that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has done I think that I have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) motives;
and though I have not approved of them, I have always known them to
be pure and unselfish. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has done nothing that I did not forgive as
soon as it was done. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) married that man, I should have forgiven
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) even that,--though I should have known that all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) future life
was destroyed, and much of mine also. I think I can make her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) happy if
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will marry me, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) must first be taught to forgive herself.
Living as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is with you, and with your wife, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) may, perhaps,
just now be more under your influence and your wife's than she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) can
possibly be under mine.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>Whereupon, Mr. Palliser promised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
would do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could. <div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) loves me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grey.

<p/>Mr. Palliser said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) did, though what ground he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
had for such assurance I am quite unable to surmise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was probably
desirous of saying the most civil thing which occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>).

<p/>The little dinner-party that evening was pleasant enough, and nothing
more was said about love. Lady Glencora talked nonsense to Mr. Grey,
and Mr. Palliser contradicted all the nonsense which his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife talked.
But this was all done in such a way that the evening passed away
pleasantly. It was tacitly admitted among them that Mr. Grey was to be
allowed to come among them as a friend, and Lady Glencora managed to
say one word to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) aside, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) promised to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) most
cordial cooperation.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXI.

<p/>Showing How George Vavasor Received a Visit.


<p/>We must go back for a few pages to scenes which happened in London
during this summer, so that the reader may understand Mr. Grey's
position when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) reached Lucerne. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had undergone another quarrel
with George Vavasor, and something of the circumstances of that
quarrel must be told.

<p/>It has been already said that George Vavasor lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) election for
the Chelsea Districts, after all the money which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had spent,--money
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had been so ill able to spend, and on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had laid
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) hands in a manner so disreputable! He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had received two thousand
pounds from the bills which Alice had executed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) behalf,--or
rather, had received the full value of three out of the four bills,
and a part of the value of the fourth, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had been driven
to raise what immediate money he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had wanted by means of a Jew
bill-discounter. One thousand pounds he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had paid over at once into
the hands of Mr. Scruby, his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) Parliamentary election agent, towards
the expenses of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) election; and when the day of polling arrived
had exactly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) hands the sum of five hundred pounds. Where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) was to get more when this was gone he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) did not know. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>)
were successful,--if the enlightened constituents of the Chelsea
Districts, contented with his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) efforts on behalf of the River Bank,
should again send him (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) to Parliament, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) might still
carry on the war. A sum of ready money he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) would have in hand; and, as
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) debts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) would be grandly indifferent to any consideration
of them. Then there might be pickings in the way of a Member of
Parliament of his (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) calibre. Companies,--mercantile companies,--would
be glad to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) as a director, paying him (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) a guinea a day,
or perhaps more, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) hour's attendance. Railways in want of
vice-chairmen might bid for his (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) services; and in the City he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) might
turn that <div class="bookquote">``M.P.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) to good account in various
ways. With such a knowledge of the City world as he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) possessed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>)
thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) could pick up a living in London, if only he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) could
retain his (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) seat in Parliament.

<p/>But what was he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) to do if he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) could not retain it? No sooner had Mr.
Scruby got the thousand pounds into his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) clutches than he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) pressed for
still more money. George Vavasor, with some show of justice on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
side, pointed out to this all-devouring agent that the sum demanded
had already been paid. This Mr. Scruby admitted, declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>)
was quite prepared to go on without any further immediate remittance,
although by doing so might subject himself to considerable risk. But
another five hundred pounds, paid at once, would add greatly to the
safety of the seat; whereas eight hundred judiciously thrown in at
the present moment would make the thing quite secure. But Vavasor
swore to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) would not part with another shilling. Never
had he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) felt such love for money as he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) did for that five hundred
pounds which he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) now held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``It's no use,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) said to Mr.
Scruby. <div class="bookquote">``I have done what you asked, and would have done more had you
asked for more at that time. As it is, I cannot make another payment
before the election.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scruby/Scruby</b></font>)</div>Mr. Scruby shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) shoulders, and said
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) would do his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) best. But George Vavasor soon knew that the
man was not doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) best,--that the man had, in truth, abandoned
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) cause. The landlord of the <div class="bookquote">``Handsome Man''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>jeered him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
went there canvassing. <div class="bookquote">``Laws, Mr. Vavasor!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the landlord of
the <div class="bookquote">``Handsome Man,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``you're not at all the fellow for us chaps
along the river,--you ain't. You're afraid to come down with the
stumpy,--that's what you are.''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>George put his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) purse,
and acknowledged to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had been afraid to come down with
the stumpy.

<p/>For the last five days of the affair George Vavasor knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
chance was gone. Mr. Scruby's face, manner, and words, told the result
of the election as plainly as any subsequent figures could do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>)
would be absent when Vavasor called, or the clerk would say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>)
was absent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) would answer in very few words, constantly shrugging
his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) shoulders. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) would even go away and leave the anxious candidate
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) was in the middle of some discussion as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) plans. It was
easy to see that Mr. Scruby no longer regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) as a successful
man, and the day of the poll showed very plainly how right Mr. Scruby
had been.

<p/>George Vavasor was rejected, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) still had his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) five hundred pounds
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) pocket. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was subject to that mortification which a
man feels when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reflects that some little additional outlay would
have secured his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) object. Whether it might have been so, or not, who
can say? But there he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, with the gateway between the lamps barred
against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), ex-Member of Parliament for the Chelsea Districts, with
five hundred pounds in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket, and little or nothing else that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
could call his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own. What was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to do with himself?

<p/>After trying to make himself heard upon the hustings when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
rejected, and pledging himself to stand again at the next election,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went home to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lodgings in Cecil Street, and endeavoured
to consider calmly his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) position in the world. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
inheritance. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had abandoned one profession after another, and was
now beyond the pale of another chance in that direction. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ambition
had betrayed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and there were no longer possible to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) any hopes
of political activity. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had estranged from himself every friend
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had ever possessed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had driven from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with violence the
devotion even of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had robbed the girl whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intended
to marry of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) money, and had so insulted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that no feeling of
amity between them was any longer possible. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had nothing now but
himself and that five hundred pounds, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still held in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
pocket. What should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do with himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought
over it all with outer calmness for awhile, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat there in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
arm-chair.

<p/>From the moment in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had first become convinced that the
election would go against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was therefore ruined on
all sides, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be calm amidst his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ruin.
Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) assumed a little smile, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were laughing at
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own position. Mr. Bott's day of rejection had come before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had written to Mr. Bott a drolling note of consolation and mock
sympathy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) had shaken hands with Mr. Scruby, and had poked his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) fun
at the agent, bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) be sure to send in his (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) little bill soon. To
all who accosted him (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) replied in a subrisive tone; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>) bantered
Calder Jones, whose seat was quite sure, till Calder Jones began to
have fears that were quite unnecessary. And now, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) sat himself
down, intending to come to some final decision as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) would
do, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) maintained the same calmness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) smiled in the same way,
though there was no one there to see the smile. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) laughed even
audibly once or twice, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) vainly endeavoured to persuade himself
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) was able to regard the world and all that belonged to it as a
bubble.

<p/>There came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) a moment in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) laughed out very audibly. <div class="bookquote">``Ha!
ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) shouted, rising up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) chair, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) walked about the
room, holding a large paper-knife in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``Ha! ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)
threw the knife away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>), and thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)
trousers-pockets, laughed again--<div class="bookquote">``Ha! ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) stood still in the
centre of the room, and the laughter was very plainly visible on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)
face, had there been anybody there to see it.

<p/>But suddenly there was a change upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) face, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) stood there all
alone, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) eyes became fierce, and the cicatrice that marred
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) countenance grew to be red and ghastly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) grinned with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)
teeth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) fists as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) still held them within his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)
pockets. <div class="bookquote">``Curse him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) said out loud. <div class="bookquote">``Curse him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), now and for
ever!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) had broken down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) calmness, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) thought of that
old man who had opposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) during his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) life, and had ruined him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) death. <div class="bookquote">``May all the evils which the dead can feel cling to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
for ever and ever!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) laughter was all gone, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) assumed
tranquillity had deserted him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>). Walking across the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)
foot against a chair; upon this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) took the chair in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) hands, and
threw it across the room. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) hardly arrested the torrent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)
maledictions as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) did so. What good was it that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) should lie to
himself by that mock tranquillity, or that false laughter? He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) lied
to himself no longer, but uttered a song of despair that was true
enough. What should he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) do? Where should he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) go? From what fountain
should he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) attempt to draw such small draughts of the water of comfort
as might support him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) at the present moment? Unless a man have some
such fountain to which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can turn, the burden of life cannot be
borne. For the moment, Vavasor tried to find such fountain in a
bottle of brandy which stood near him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) half filled a tumbler, and
then, dashing some water on it, swallowed it greedily. <div class="bookquote">``By --!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``I believe it is the best thing a man can do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But where was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to go? to whom was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to turn himself? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went to
a high desk which stood in one corner of the room, and unlocking it,
took out a revolving pistol, and for a while carried it about with
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned it up, and looked at it, and tried the
lock, and snapped it without caps, to see that the barrel went
round fairly. <div class="bookquote">``It's a beggarly thing to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, and then
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned the pistol down again; <div class="bookquote">``and if I do do it, I'll use it
first for another purpose.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) poured out for himself more
brandy-and-water, and having drunk it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) threw himself upon the
sofa, and seemed to sleep.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not sleep, and by-and-by there came a slight single knock
at the door, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) instantly answered. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not answer it
in the usual way by bidding the comer to come in. <div class="bookquote">``Who's there?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
said. Then the comer attempted to enter, turning the handle of the
door. But the door had been locked, and the key was on Vavasor's
side. <div class="bookquote">``Who's there?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked again, speaking out loudly, but in an
angry voice. <div class="bookquote">``It is I,''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>said a woman's voice. <div class="bookquote">``D--ation!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Vavasor/George Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said
George Vavasor.

<p/>The woman heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) made no sign of having heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
simply remained standing where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was till something further should
be done within. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew the man well, and knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must bide
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) time. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was very patient,--and for the time was meek, though
it might be that there would come an end to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) meekness. Vavasor,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) voice, and knew who was there, had again thrown
himself on the sofa. There flashed across his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind another thought or
two as to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) future career,--another idea about the pistol, which
still lay upon the table. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) let the intruder in, and
undergo the nuisance of a disagreeable interview, if the end of all
things might come in time to save him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from such trouble? There he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lay
for ten minutes thinking, and then the low single knock was heard
again. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jumped upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes were full of fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
knew that it was useless to bid her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) go and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would sit
there, if it were through the whole night. Should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) open the door
and strangle her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and pass out over her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with the pistol in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand,
so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might make that other reckoning which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desired to
accomplish, and then never come back any more?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took a turn through the room, and then walked gently up to the
door, and undid the lock. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not open the door, nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bid
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) visitor enter, but having made the way easy for her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chose
to come in, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked back to the sofa and threw himself on it again.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did so, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand across the table so as to bring the
pistol near to himself at the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be lying. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
paused a moment after she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had heard the sound of the key, and then
she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way into the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not at first speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
closed the door very gently, and then, looking around, came up to the
foot of the sofa. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paused a moment, waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to address
her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said nothing, but lay there looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
the first to speak. <div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``what am I to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a woman of about thirty years of age, dressed poorly, in old
garments, but still with decency, and with some attempt at feminine
prettiness. There were flowers in the bonnet on her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, though
the bonnet had that unmistakable look of age which is quite as
distressing to bonnets as it is to women, and the flowers themselves
were battered and faded. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had long black ringlets on each cheek,
hanging down much below her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, and brought forward so as to hide
in some degree the hollowness of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jaws. Her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes had a peculiar
brightness, but now they left on those who looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cursorily
no special impression as to their colour. They had been blue,--that
dark violet blue, which is so rare, but is sometimes so lovely. Her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
forehead was narrow, her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth was small, and her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips were thin;
but her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose was perfect in its shape, and, by the delicacy of its
modelling, had given a peculiar grace to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face in the days when
things had gone well with her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), when her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheeks had been full with
youth and good living, and had been dimpled by the softness of love
and mirth. There were no dimples there now, and all the softness
which still remained was that softness which sorrow and continual
melancholy give to suffering women. On her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulders she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore a light
shawl, which was fastened to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bosom with a large clasp brooch. Her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
faded dress was supported by a wide crinoline, but the under garment
had lost all the grace of its ancient shape, and now told that
woman's tale of poverty and taste for dress which is to be read in
the outward garb of so many of Eve's daughters. The whole story was
told so that those who ran might read it. When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) home
this afternoon, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had struggled hard to dress herself so that
something of the charm of apparel might be left to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
known of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own failure at every twist that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had given to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
gown, and at every jerk with which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had settled her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shawl. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had despaired at every push she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had given to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) old flowers, vainly
striving to bring them back to their old forms; but still she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
persevered. With long tedious care she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had mended the old gloves
which would hardly hold her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fingers. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had carefully hidden the
rags of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sleeves. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had washed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) little shrivelled collar, and
had smoothed it out painfully. It had been a separate grief to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could find no cuffs to put round her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wrists;--and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
knew that no cuffs could have availed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) anything. Nothing could
avail her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) now. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) expected nothing from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) visit; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had come
forth anxiously, and would have waited there throughout the whole
night had access to his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) room been debarred to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
said, standing at the bottom of the sofa, <div class="bookquote">``what am I to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lay there with his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), the windows were at
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back, and he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) very plainly. He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw and appreciated
the little struggles she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had made to create by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) appearance some
reminiscence of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) former self. He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw the shining coarseness of
the long ringlets which had once been softer than silk. He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw the
sixpenny brooch on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bosom where he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had once placed a jewel, the
price of which would now have been important to him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw it all,
and lay there for a while, silently reading it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let me stand here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``without speaking a word to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want you to stand there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all very well, George. I know you don't want me to stand
here. I know you don't want to see me ever again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it. Of course I know it. But what am I to do? Where am I to
go for money? Even you would not wish that I should starve?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true, too. I certainly would not wish it. I should be
delighted to hear that you had plenty to eat and plenty to drink, and
plenty of clothes to wear. I believe that's what you care for the
most, after all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was only for your sake,--because you liked it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--I did like it; but that has come to an end, as have all my
other likings. You know very well that I can do nothing more for you.
What good do you do yourself by coming here to annoy me? Have I not
told you over and over again that you were never to look for me here?
Is it likely that I should give you money now, simply because you
have disobeyed me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where else was I to find you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you have found me at all? I don't want you to find me. I
shall give you nothing;--not a penny. You know very well that we've
had all that out before. When I put you into business I told you that
we were to see no more of each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Business!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I never could make enough out of the shop to
feed a bird.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That wasn't my fault. Putting you there cost me over a hundred
pounds, and you consented to take the place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't consent. I was obliged to go there because you took my
other home away from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have it as you like, my dear. That was all I could do for you;--and
more than most men would have done, when all things are considered.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) got up from the sofa, and stood himself on the hearthrug,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back to the fireplace. <div class="bookquote">``At any rate, you may be sure of
this, Jane;--that I shall do nothing more. You have come here to
torment me, but you shall get nothing by it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have come here because I am starving.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have nothing for you. Now go;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pointed to the door.
Nevertheless, for more than three years of his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life this woman had
been his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) closest companion, his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nearest friend, the being with whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was most familiar. He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) according to his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fashion of
loving, and certainly she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said repeating the
word very angrily. <div class="bookquote">``Do as I bid you, or it will be the worse for
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you give me a sovereign?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--I will give you nothing. I have desired you not to come to me
here, and I will not pay for you coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I will not go;''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>and the woman sat down upon a chair at the foot
of the table. <div class="bookquote">``I will not go till you have given me something to buy
food. You may put me out of the room if you can, but I will lie at
the door of the stairs. And if you get me out of the house, I will
sit upon the door-step.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you play that game, my poor girl, the police will take you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let them. It has come to that with me, that I care for nothing. Out
of this I will not go till you give me money--unless I am put out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And for this she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had dressed herself with so much care, mending her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
gloves, and darning her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) little fragments of finery! He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood looking
at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands thrust deep into his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pockets,--looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
and thinking what he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had better do to rid himself of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) presence. If
he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) even quite resolved to take that little final journey of which we
have spoken, with the pistol in his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand, why should he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) not go and
leave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) there? Or, for the matter of that, why should he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) not make
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heir to all remainder of his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wealth? What he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) still had left
was sufficient to place her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in a seventh heaven of the earth. He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
cared but little for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and was at this moment angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); but
there was no one for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cared more, and no friend with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was less angry. But then his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind was not quite made up as to that
final journey. Therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) desired to rid himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) room of
the nuisance of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) presence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jane,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) again with that assumed tranquillity
of which I have spoken, <div class="bookquote">``you talk of starving and of being ruined,--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am starving. I have not a shilling in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it may be a comfort to you in your troubles to know that
I am, at any rate, as badly off as you are? I won't say that I am
starving, because I could get food to eat at this moment if I wanted
it; but I am utterly ruined. My property,--what should have been
mine,--has been left away from me. I have lost the trumpery seat
in Parliament for which I have paid so much. All my relations have
turned their backs upon me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you not going to be married?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, rising quickly from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
chair and coming close to him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Married! No;--but I am going to blow my brains out. Look at that
pistol, my girl. Of course you won't think that I am in earnest,--but
I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked up into his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face piteously. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! George,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you
won't do that?''


 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``Oh! George,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you won't do that?'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I shall do that. There is nothing else left for me to do. You
talk to me about starving. I tell you that I should have no objection
to be starved, and so be put an end to in that way. It's not so bad
as some other ways when it comes gradually. You and I, Jane, have not
played our cards very well. We have staked all that we had, and we've
been beaten. It's no good whimpering after what's lost. We'd better
go somewhere else and begin a new game.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go where?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!--that's just what I can't tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'll go anywhere with you. If what you say is
true,--if you're not going to be married, and will let me come to
you, I will work for you like a slave. I will indeed. I know I'm
poorly looking now--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My girl, where I'm going, I shall not want any slave; and as for
your looks--when you go there too,--they'll be of no matter, as far

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, George, where are you going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wherever people do go when their brains are knocked out of them; or,
rather, when they have knocked out their own brains,--if that makes
any difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``George,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) now, and took hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) by the front
of his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) coat, and for the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to do so,--<div class="bookquote">``George,
you frighten me. Do not do that. Say that you will not do that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am just saying that I shall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you not afraid of God's anger? You and I have been very wicked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have, my poor girl. I don't know much about your wickedness. I've
been like Topsy;--indeed I am a kind of second Topsy myself. But
what's the good of whimpering when it's over?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't over; it isn't over,--at any rate for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I knew how I could begin again. But all this is nonsense,
Jane, and you must go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must tell me, first, that you are not going to--kill yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose I shall do it to-night,--or, perhaps, not to-morrow.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are not going to be married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I'm not going to be married, certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I think you'd better go now.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rose and went, and he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
let her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) leave the room without giving her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a shilling! His (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bantering
tone, in speaking of his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own position, had been successful. It had
caused her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to take herself off quietly. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew enough of his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) usual
manner to be aware that his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) threats of self destruction were probably
unreal; but, nevertheless, what he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had said had created some feeling
in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart which had induced her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to yield to him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and go away in
peace.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXII.

<p/>Showing How George Vavasor Paid a Visit.


<p/>It was nearly seven o'clock in the evening,--a hot, July
evening,--when the woman went from Vavasor's room, and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) there
alone. It was necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) should immediately do something.
In the first place he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) must dine, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) meant to carry out his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
threat, and shoot himself at once. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had no such intention as
that, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) stood for some minutes with the pistol in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) hand.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was thinking then of shooting some one else. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) resolved that,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) did so at all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would not do it on that evening, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
locked up the pistol again in the standing desk. After that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) took
up some papers, referring to steam packets, which were lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
table. They contained the programmes of different companies, and
showed how one vessel went on one day to New York, and another on
another day would take out a load of emigrants for New Zealand and
Australia. <div class="bookquote">``That's a good line,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) read a certain
prospectus. <div class="bookquote">``They generally go to the bottom, and save a man from any
further trouble on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own account.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) dressed himself, putting
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) boots and coat, and went out to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) club for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) dinner.

<p/>London was still fairly full,--that is to say, the West End was not
deserted, although Parliament had been broken up two months earlier
than usual, in preparation for the new elections. Many men who had
gone down into the country were now back again in town, and the
dining-room at the club was crowded. Men came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) condoling
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>), telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was well rid of a great nuisance, that
the present Members for the Chelsea Districts would not sit long, or
that there would be another general election in a year or two. To all
these little speeches he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) made cheerful replies, and was declared by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) acquaintance to bear his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) disappointment well. Calder Jones came
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) and talked hunting talk, and Vavasor expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) intention
of being at Roebury in November. <div class="bookquote">``You had better join our club,''  (<font color='red'><b>Calder Jones/Jones</b></font>)</div>said
Calder Jones. In answer to which Vavasor said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)
would join the club. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) remained in the smoking-room till nearly
eleven; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) took himself home, and remained up half the night
destroying papers. Every written document on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) could lay his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)
hands he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) destroyed. All the pigeon-holes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) desk were emptied
out, and their contents thrown into the flames. At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) looked at
the papers before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) burned them; but the trouble of doing so soon
tired him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) condemned them all, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) came to them, without
examination. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) selected a considerable amount of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) clothes,
and packed up two portmanteaus, folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) coats with care, and
inspecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) boots narrowly, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) might see which, out of
the large number before him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>), it might be best worth his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) while to
take with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>). When that was done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) took from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) desk a bag of
sovereigns, and, pouring them out upon the table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) counted them out
into parcels of twenty-five each, and made them up carefully into
rouleaus with paper. These, when complete, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) divided among the two
portmanteaus and a dressing-bag which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) also packed and a travelling
desk, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) filled with papers, pens, and the like. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) put
into it no written document. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) carefully looked through his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) linen,
and anything that had been marked with more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) initials he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)
rejected. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) took out a bundle of printed cards, and furnished a
card-case with them. On these cards was inscribed the name of Gregory
Vance. When all was finished, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) stood for awhile with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) back
to the fireplace contemplating his (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) work. <div class="bookquote">``After all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) said to
himself, <div class="bookquote">``I know that I shall never start; and, if I do, nobody can
hinder me, and my own name would be as good as any other. As for a
man with such a face as mine not being known, that is out of the
question.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But still he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) liked the arrangements which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) had made, and
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) had looked at them for awhile he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) went to bed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) was up early the next morning, and had some coffee brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>)
by the servant of the house, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) drank it he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) had an interview
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) landlady. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was going,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) said;--<div class="bookquote">``going that very day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It might be possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) would change his (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) mind; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) would
desire to start without delay, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) did go, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) would pay her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) then
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) owed her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>), and what would be due for her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) lodgings under a
week's notice. The woman stared, and curtseyed, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) money.
Vavasor, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) had lately been much pressed for money, had never
been so foolish as to owe debts where he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) lived. <div class="bookquote">``There will be some
things left about, Mrs. Bunsby,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and I will get you to keep
them till I call or send.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Bunsby said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bunsby</b></font>) would, and then
looked her (<font color='blue'><b>Bunsby</b></font>) last at him (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>). After that interview she (<font color='blue'><b>Bunsby</b></font>) never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) again.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) was left alone he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) put on a rough morning coat, and taking up
the pistol, placed it carefully in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) pocket, and sallied forth. It
was manifest enough that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) had some decided scheme in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) head, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) turned quickly towards the West when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) reached the Strand, went
across Trafalgar Square to Pall Mall East, and then turned up Suffolk
Street. Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) reached the club-house at the corner he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) paused and
looked back, facing first one way and then the other. <div class="bookquote">``The chances
are that I shall never see anything of it again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) said to himself.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) laughed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) own silent way, shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) head slightly, and
turning again quickly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) heel, walked up the street till he (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>)
reached the house of Mr. Jones, the pugilistic tailor. The reader, no
doubt, has forgotten all he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) ever knew of Mr. Jones, the pugilistic
tailor. It can soon be told again. At Mr. Jones's house John Grey
lodged when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was in London, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was in London at this moment.

<p/>Vavasor rang the bell, and as soon as the servant came he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) went
quickly into the house, and passed her (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) in the passage. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Grey is
at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I will go up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div>The girl said that Mr. Grey
was at home, but suggested that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had better announce the gentleman.
But Vavasor was already halfway up the stairs, and before the girl
had reached the first landing place, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had entered Mr. Grey's room
and closed the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>).

<p/>Grey was sitting near the open window, in a dressing-gown, and was
reading. The breakfast things were on the table, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had not as
yet breakfasted. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) saw George Vavasor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
chair quickly, and put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) book. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Vavasor,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I
hardly expected to see you in my lodgings again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor; <div class="bookquote">``but, nevertheless, here I am.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) right hand in the pocket which held the pistol, and held his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
left hand under his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) waistcoat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I ask why you have come?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I intend to tell you, at any rate, whether you ask me or not. I have
come to declare in your own hearing,--as I am in the habit of doing
occasionally behind your back,--that you are a blackguard,--to spit
in your face, and defy you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) said this he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) suited his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) action to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) words, but without any serious result. <div class="bookquote">``I have come here to see
if you are man enough to resent any insult that I can offer you; but
I doubt whether you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing that you can say to me, Mr. Vavasor, will have any effect
upon me;--except that you can, of course, annoy me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I mean to annoy you, too, before I have done with you. Will you
fight me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fight a duel with you,--with pistols? Certainly not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you are a coward, as I supposed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be a fool if I were to do such a thing as that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, Mr. Grey. You managed to worm yourself into an intimacy
with my cousin, Miss Vavasor, and to become engaged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>). When she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
found out what you were, how paltry, and mean, and vile, she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) changed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) mind, and bade you leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you here at her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) request?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am here as her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) representative.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Self-appointed, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, sir, you think wrong. I am at this moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) affianced
husband; and I find that, in spite of all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) has said to
you,--which was enough, I should have thought, to keep any man of
spirit out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) presence,--you still persecute her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) by going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
house, and forcing yourself upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) presence. Now, I give you two
alternatives. You shall either give me your written promise never to
go near her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) again, or you shall fight me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall do neither one nor the other,--as you know very well
yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop till I have done, sir. If you have courage enough to fight me,
I will meet you in any country. I will fight you here in London, or,
if you are afraid of that, I will go over to France, or to America,
if that will suit you better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing of the kind will suit me at all. I don't want to have
anything to do with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you are a coward.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I am;--but your saying so will not make me one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a coward, and a liar, and a blackguard. I have given you the
option of behaving like a gentleman, and you have refused it. Now,
look here. I have come here with arms, and I do not intend to leave
this room without using them, unless you will promise to give me the
meeting that I have proposed.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) took the pistol out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that you are going to murder me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>Grey asked. There were
two windows in the room, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had been sitting near to that which
was furthest removed from the fireplace, and consequently furthest
removed from the bell, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) visitor was now standing immediately
between him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) and the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had to think what steps he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) might best
take, and to act upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) decision instantly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was by no means
a timid man, and was one, moreover, very little prone to believe
in extravagant action. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) did not think, even now, that this
disappointed, ruined man had come there with any intention of killing
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that a pistol in the hands of an angry man is
dangerous, and that it behoved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to do his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best to rid himself of
the nuisance which now encumbered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that you are
going to murder me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean that you shall not leave this room alive unless you promise
to meet me, and fight it out.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>Upon hearing this, Grey turned himself
towards the bell. <div class="bookquote">``If you move a step, I will fire at you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said
Vavasor. Grey paused a moment, and looked him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) full in the face. <div class="bookquote">``I
will,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be murder,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't think that you will frighten me by ugly words,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Vavasor.
<div class="bookquote">``I am beyond that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div><p/>Grey had stopped for a moment to fix his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) eyes on the other man's
face; but it was only for a moment, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) went on to the bell.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had seen that the pistol was pointed at himself, and had once
thought of rushing across the room at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) adversary, calculating that
a shot fired at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) did so might miss him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would
then have a fair chance of disarming the madman. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) chief object
was to avoid any personal conflict, to escape the indignity of a
scramble for the pistol,--and especially to escape the necessity of
a consequent appearance at some police-office, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would have
to justify himself, and answer the questions of a lawyer hired to
cross-question him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) made, therefore, towards the bell, trusting
that Vavasor would not fire at him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>), but having some little thought
also as to the danger of the moment. It might be that everything was
over for him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) now,--that the fatal hour had come, and that eternity
was close upon him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>). Something of the spirit of a prayer flashed
across his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) mind as he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) moved. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) heard the click of the pistol's
hammer as it fell, and was aware that his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) eyes were dazzled, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was unconscious of seeing any flame. He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) felt something in the air,
and knew that the pistol had been fired;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) did not know whether
the shot had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) or had missed him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) hand was out for the
bell-handle, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had pulled it, before he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was
unhurt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``D--ation!''  (<font color='red'><b>the murderer</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the murderer. But he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) did not pull the trigger
again. Though the weapon had of late been so often in his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>)
forgot, in the agitation of the moment, that his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) missing once was but
of small matter if he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) chose to go on with his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) purpose. Were there not
five other barrels for him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>), each making itself ready by the discharge
of the other? But he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had paused, forgetting, in his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) excitement, the
use of his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) weapon, and before he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had bethought himself that the man
was still in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard the sound of the bell. <div class="bookquote">``D--ation!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) exclaimed. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned round, left the room, hurried down the
stairs, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way out into the street, having again passed the
girl on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way.

<p/>Grey, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) perceived that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) enemy was gone, turned round to look
for the bullet or its mark. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) soon found the little hole in the
window-shutter, and probing it with the point of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) pencil, came
upon the morsel of lead which might now just as readily have been
within his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) own brain. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) left it for the time, and then made
some not inaccurate calculation as to the narrowness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) own
escape. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had been standing directly between Vavasor and the
shutter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) found, from the height of the hole, that the shot
must have passed close beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) ear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) remembered to have heard
the click of the hammer, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) could not remember the sound of the
report, and when the girl entered the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) perceived at once from
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) manner that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was unaware that firearms had been used.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has that gentleman left the house?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>Grey asked. The girl said that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had left the house. <div class="bookquote">``Don't admit him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>);--<div class="bookquote">``that
is, if you can avoid it. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is not in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) right senses.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) asked for Mr. Jones, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) landlord, and in a few minutes the
pugilistic tailor was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>).

<p/>During those few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had been called upon to resolve what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
would do now. Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) put the police at once upon the track of the
murderer, who was, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) remembered too well, the first cousin of the
woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) still desired to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) wife? That cross-examination
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would have to undergo at the police-office, and again
probably in an assize court, in which all his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) relations with
the Vavasor family would be made public, was very vivid to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
imagination. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was called upon by duty to do something he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) felt
almost assured. The man who had been allowed to make such an attempt
once with impunity, might probably make it again. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resolved
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) need not now say anything about the pistol to the pugilistic
tailor, unless the tailor said something to him (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jones,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that man whom I had to put out of the room once
before, has been here again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has there been another tussle, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--nothing of that kind. But we must take some steps to prevent
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) getting in again, if we can help it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Calder Jones/Jones</b></font>)</div><p/>Jones promised his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) aid, and offered to go at once to the police.
To this, however, Mr. Grey demurred, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) should himself
seek assistance from some magistrate. Jones promised to be very
vigilant as to watching the door; and then John Grey sat down to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) breakfast. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) thought much of what had occurred. It
was impossible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) should not think much of so narrow an escape.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had probably been as near death as a man may well be without
receiving any injury; and the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) thought of it, the more
strongly he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) could not allow the thing to pass
by without some notice, or some precaution as to the future.

<p/>At eleven o'clock he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) went to Scotland Yard, and saw some
officer great in power over policemen, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) all the
circumstances,--confidentially. The powerful officer recommended an
equally confidential reference to a magistrate; and towards evening
a very confidential policeman in plain clothes paid a visit to
Vavasor's lodgings in Cecil Street. But Vavasor lodged there no
longer. Mrs. Bunsby, who was also very confidential,--and at her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) wits'
end because she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) could not learn the special business of the stranger
who called,--stated that Mr. George Vavasor left her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) house in a cab
at ten o'clock that morning, having taken with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) such luggage as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had packed, and having gone, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was afraid, for good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as Mrs.
Bunsby expressed it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had gone for good, and at the moment in which the policeman was
making the inquiry in Cecil Street, was leaning over the side of an
American steamer which had just got up her (<font color='blue'><b>Bunsby</b></font>) steam and weighed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bunsby</b></font>)
anchor in the Mersey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) was on board at six o'clock, and it was not
till the next day that the cabman was traced who had carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) to
Euston Square Station. Of course, it was soon known that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) had gone
to America, but it was not thought worth while to take any further
steps towards arresting him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>). Mr. Grey himself was decidedly opposed to
any such attempt, declaring his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) opinion that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) own evidence would
be insufficient to obtain a conviction. The big men in Scotland Yard
were loth to let the matter drop. Their mouths watered after the job,
and they had very numerous and very confidential interviews with John
Grey. But it was decided that nothing should be done. <div class="bookquote">``Pity!''  (<font color='red'><b>superintendent</b></font>)</div>said
one enterprising superintendent, in answer to the condolings of a
brother superintendent. <div class="bookquote">``Pity's no name for it. It's the greatest
shame as ever I knew since I joined the force. A man as was a Member
of Parliament only last Session,--as belongs to no end of swell
clubs, a gent as well known in London as any gent about the town! And
I'd have had him (<font color='blue'><b>gent</b></font>) back in three months, as sure as my name's Walker.''
 (<font color='red'><b>that superintendent</b></font>)</div>And that superintendent felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) profession and his (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) country were
alike disgraced.

<p/>And now George Vavasor vanishes from our pages, and will be heard of
no more. Roebury knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) no longer, nor Pall Mall, nor the Chelsea
Districts. His (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) disappearance was a nine days' wonder, but the world
at large knew nothing of the circumstances of that attempt in Suffolk
Street. Mr. Grey himself told the story to no one, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) told it to
Mr. Palliser at Lucerne. Mr. Scruby complained bitterly of the way in
which Vavasor had robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Scruby</b></font>); but I doubt whether Scruby, in truth,
lost much by the transaction. To Kate, down in Westmoreland, no
tidings came of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brother, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) sojourn in London with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) aunt
had nearly come to an end before she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was gone. Even then
the rumour reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) through Captain Bellfield, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) learned
what few facts she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) knew from Mrs. Bunsby in Cecil Street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gent</b></font>) was always mysterious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow, <div class="bookquote">``and now he (<font color='blue'><b>gent</b></font>) has
vanished. I hate mysteries, and, as for myself, I think it will be
much better that he (<font color='blue'><b>gent</b></font>) should not come back again.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>Perhaps Kate was of
the same opinion, but, if so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) kept it to herself.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXIII.

<p/>In Which Come Tidings of Great Moment to All Pallisers.


<p/>It was not till they had been for a day or two together at Lucerne
that Mr. Grey told Mr. Palliser the story of George Vavasor's visit
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) in Suffolk Street. Having begun the history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) connection
with Alice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) found himself obliged to go with it to the end, and as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) described the way in which the man had vanished from the sight of
all who had known him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had in truth gone, so as no longer to
be a cause of dread, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not without dissimulation, keep back
the story of that last scene. <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>gent</b></font>) tried to murder you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Palliser. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gent</b></font>) should be caught and,--and--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>Mr. Palliser hesitated,
not liking to say boldly that the first cousin of the lady who was
now living with him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) ought to be hung.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is better as it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gent</b></font>) actually walked into your rooms in the day time, and fired a
pistol at you as you were sitting at your breakfast! He (<font color='blue'><b>gent</b></font>) did that in
London, and then walked off and went abroad, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>gent</b></font>) had nothing
to fear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was just it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey.

<p/>Mr. Palliser began to think that something ought to be done to make
life more secure in the metropolis of the world. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) not known Mr.
Grey, or been accustomed to see the other man in Parliament, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would
not have thought so much about it. But it was almost too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) reflected that one man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now called his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend, had
been nearly murdered in daylight, in the heart of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own part of
London, by another man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had reckoned among his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Parliamentary
supporters. <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>gent</b></font>) has got your money too!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Palliser, putting
all the circumstances of the case together. In answer to this Mr. Grey
said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) hoped the loss might eventually be his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) own; but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
was bound to regard the money which had been taken as part of Miss
Vavasor's fortune. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gent</b></font>) is simply the greatest miscreant of whom I
ever heard in my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser. <div class="bookquote">``The wonder is that Miss
Vavasor should ever have brought herself to--to like him (<font color='blue'><b>gent</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>Then Mr.
Grey apologized for Alice, explaining that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin
had come from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) early years; that the man himself was clever and
capable of assuming pleasant ways, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not been wholly
bad till ruin had come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gent</b></font>) attempted public life and made
himself miserable by failing, as most men do who make that attempt,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey. This was a statement which Mr. Palliser could not allow
to pass without notice. Whereupon the two men got away from George
Vavasor and their own individual interests, and went on seriously
discussing the merits and demerits of public life. <div class="bookquote">``The end of it all
is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey at last, <div class="bookquote">``that public men in England should be rich
like you, and not poor like that miserable wretch, who has now lost
everything that the Fates had given him (<font color='blue'><b>gent</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div><p/>They continued to live at Lucerne in this way for a fortnight. Mr.
Grey, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was not unfrequently alone with Alice, did not plead
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) suit in direct words; but continued to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) on terms
of close and easy friendship. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin had
left England,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had gone to America immediately after his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
disappointment in regard to the seat in Parliament, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would
probably not return. <div class="bookquote">``Poor George!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice had said; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is a man
very much to be pitied.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is a man very much to be pitied,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>Grey
had replied. After that, nothing more was said between them about
George Vavasor. From Lady Glencora Alice did hear something; but
Lady Glencora herself had not heard the whole story. <div class="bookquote">``I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
misbehaved himself, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora said; <div class="bookquote">``but then, you
know, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) always does that. I believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) saw Mr. Grey and insulted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). Perhaps you had better not ask anything about it till by-and-by.
You'll be able to get anything out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) then.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>In answer to this
Alice made her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) usual protest, and Lady Glencora, as was customary,
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was a fool.

<p/>I am inclined to think that Mr. Grey knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was about. Lady
Glencora once scolded him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) very vehemently for not bringing the affair
to an end. <div class="bookquote">``We shall be going on to Italy before it's settled,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
said; <div class="bookquote">``and I don't suppose you can go with us, unless it is settled.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mr. Grey protested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had no intention of going to Italy in
either case.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it will be put off for another year or two, and you are both of
you as old as Adam and Eve already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We ancient people are never impatient,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were you I would go to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), roundly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
should marry me, and then I would shake her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). If you were to scold
her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), till she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) did not know whether she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) stood on her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) head or her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
heels, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would come to reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose you try that, Lady Glencora!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't. It's she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) that always scolds me,--as you will her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)'s your wife. You and Mr. Palliser are very much alike. You're both
of you so very virtuous that no woman would have a chance of picking
a hole in your coats.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/>But Lady Glencora was wrong. Alice would, no doubt, have submitted
herself patiently to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) lover's rebukes, and would have confessed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own sins towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) with any amount of self-accusation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
might have required; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would not, on that account, have been
more willing to obey him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) in that one point, as to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) now
required present obedience. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) understood that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) must be taught
to forgive herself for the evil she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had done,--to forgive herself,
at any rate in part,--before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could be induced to return to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) old allegiance to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). Thus they went on together at Lucerne,
passing quiet, idle days,--with some pretence of reading, with a
considerable amount of letter-writing, with boat excursions and pony
excursions,--till the pony excursions came to a sudden end by means
of a violent edict, as to which, and the cause of it, a word or two
must be said just now. During these days of the boats and the ponies,
the carriage which Lady Glencora hated so vehemently was shut up in
limbo, and things went very pleasantly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>). Mr. Palliser received
political letters from England, which made his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) mouth water sadly,
and was often very fidgety. Parliament was not now sitting, and the
Government would, of course, remain intact till next February. Might
it not be possible that when the rent came in the Cabinet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) might
yet be present at the darning? He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was a constant man, and had once
declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) intention of being absent for a year. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) continued to
speak to Grey of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) coming travels, as though it was impossible
that they should be over until after the next Easter. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was
sighing for Westminster, and regretting the blue books which were
accumulating themselves at Matching;--till on a sudden, there came to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) tidings which upset all his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) plans, which routed the ponies, which
made everything impossible, which made the Alps impassable and the
railways dangerous, which drove Burgo Fitzgerald out of Mr. Palliser's
head, and so confused him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could no longer calculate the
blunders of the present Chancellor of the Exchequer. All the Palliser
world was about to be moved from its lowest depths, to the summits of
its highest mountains. Lady Glencora had whispered into her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband's
ear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) thought it probable--; she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) wasn't sure;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) didn't
know. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) burst out into tears on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bosom as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) bedside.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was beside himself when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did with the
primary intention of telegraphing to London for half a dozen leading
physicians. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went out by the lake side, and walked there alone for
ten minutes in a state of almost unconscious exaltation. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not
quite remember where he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was, or what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was doing. The one thing in
the world which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had lacked; the one joy which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had wanted so
much, and which is so common among men, was coming to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) also. In a
few minutes it was to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) as though each hand already rested on the
fair head of a little male Palliser, of whom one should rule in the
halls at Gatherum, and the other be eloquent among the Commons of
England. Hitherto,--for the last eight or nine months, since his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
first hopes had begun to fade,--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been a man degraded in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own
sight amidst all his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) honours. What good was all the world to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) if
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own to come after him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)? We must give him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
due, too, when we speak of this. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had not had wit enough to hide
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) grief from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife; his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knowledge of women and of men in social
life had not been sufficient to teach him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) how this should be done;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had wished to do it. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had never willingly rebuked her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) for
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) disappointment, either by a glance of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eye, or a tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
voice; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had already forgiven everything. Burgo Fitzgerald
was a myth. Mrs. Marsham should never again come near her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>). Mr. Bott
was, of course, a thing abolished;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) had not even had the sense to
keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) seat in Parliament. Dandy and Flirt should feed on gilded
corn, and there should be an artificial moon always ready in the
ruins. If only those d--able saddle-ponies of Lucerne had not come
across his (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>) wife's path! He (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>) went at once into the yard and ordered
that the ponies should be abolished;--sent away, one and all, to the
furthest confines of the canton; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>) himself inspected the
cushions of the carriage. Were they dry? As it was August in those
days, and August in Lucerne is a warm month, it may be presumed that
they were dry.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>) then remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>) had promised to send Alice up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>)
wife, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>) hurried back into the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was alone in the
breakfast-room, waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>) and for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dandy</b></font>) wife. In these days, Mr.
Grey would usually join them at dinner; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) seldom saw them before
eleven or twelve o'clock in the day. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would saunter in and
join Mr. Palliser, and they would all be together till the evening.
When the expectant father of embryo dukes entered the room, Alice
perceived at once that some matter was astir. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) manner was
altogether changed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) showed by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eye that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was eager and
moved beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wont. <div class="bookquote">``Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``would you mind going up to
Glencora's room? She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wishes to speak to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had never called
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) Alice before, and as soon as the word was spoken, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) remembered
himself and blushed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) isn't ill, I hope?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) isn't ill. At least I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had better not get up quite
yet. Don't let her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) excite herself, if you can help it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice rising.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm so much obliged to you;--but, Miss Vavasor--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You called me Alice just now, Mr. Palliser, and I took it as a great
compliment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) blushed again. <div class="bookquote">``Did I? Very well. Then I'll do it again--if you'll
let me. But, if you please, do be as calm with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) as you can. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
is so easily excited, you know. Of course, if there's anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
fancies, we'll take care to get it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) must be kept
quiet.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Upon this Alice left him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), having had no moment of time to
guess what had happened, or was about to happen; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was again
alone, contemplating the future glories of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) house. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a
thought for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) poor cousin Jeffrey, whose nose was now so terribly
out of joint? No, indeed. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thoughts were all of himself, and the
good things that were coming to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),--of the new world of interest
that was being opened for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). It would be better to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), this, than
being Chancellor of the Exchequer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) would rather have it in store
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) to be father of the next Duke of Omnium, than make half a
dozen consecutive annual speeches in Parliament as to the ways and
means, and expenditure of the British nation! Could it be possible
that this foreign tour had produced for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) this good fortune? If so,
how luckily had things turned out! He (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) would remember even that ball
at Lady Monk's with gratitude. Perhaps a residence abroad would be
best for Lady Glencora at this particular period of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) life. If
so, abroad she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) should certainly live. Before resolving, however,
on anything permanently on this head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) might
judiciously consult those six first-rate London physicians, whom, in
the first moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) excitement, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) had been desirous of summoning
to Lucerne.

<p/>In the meantime Alice had gone up to the bedroom of the lady who was
now to be the subject of so much anxious thought. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) entered
the room, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) friend was up and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) dressing-gown, lying on a sofa
which stood at the foot of the bed. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Alice, I'm so glad you've
come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``I do so want to hear your voice.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Then
Alice knelt beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) were ill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hasn't told you? But of course he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wouldn't. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)? But,
Alice, how did he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) look? Did you observe anything about him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
pleased?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did observe something, and I think he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was pleased. But what is it?
He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) called me Alice. And seemed to be quite unlike himself. But what
is it? He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) told me that I was to come to you instantly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Alice, can't you guess?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Then suddenly Alice did guess the
secret, and whispered her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) guess into Lady Glencora's ear. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose
it is so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``I know what they'll do. They'll
kill me by fussing over me. If I could go about my work like a
washerwoman, I should be all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said, some two or three hours afterwards. <div class="bookquote">``I
won't deny that I am very happy. It seemed as though I were destined
to bring nothing but misery to everybody, and I used to wish myself
dead so often. I shan't wish myself dead now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall all have to go home, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>washerwoman</b></font>) says so;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>washerwoman</b></font>) seems to think that I oughtn't to travel above
a mile and a half a day. When I talked of going down the Rhine in
one of the steamers, I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>washerwoman</b></font>) would have gone into a fit. When I
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>washerwoman</b></font>) why, he (<font color='blue'><b>washerwoman</b></font>) gave me such a look. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>washerwoman</b></font>)'ll make a goose of
himself;--and he (<font color='blue'><b>washerwoman</b></font>)'ll make geese of us, too; which is worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/>On that afternoon, as they were walking together, Mr. Palliser told
the important secret to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) new friend, Mr. Grey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could not deny
himself the pleasure of talking about this great event. <div class="bookquote">``It is a
matter, you see, of such immense importance to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>Mr. Palliser said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey. <div class="bookquote">``Every man feels that when a child
is about to be born to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>But this did not at all satisfy Mr.
Palliser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``That's of course. It is an important thing to
everybody;--very important, no doubt. But, when a man--. You see,
Grey, I don't think a man is a bit better because he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) is rich, or
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) has a title; nor do I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) is likely to be in any
degree the happier. I am quite sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) has no right to be in the
slightest degree proud of that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) has had no hand in doing for
himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Men usually are very proud of such advantages,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think that I am; I don't, indeed. I am proud of some things.
Whenever I can manage to carry a point in the House, I feel very
proud of it. I don't think I ever knocked under to any one, and I am
proud of that.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>Perhaps, Mr. Palliser was thinking of a certain time
when his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) uncle the Duke had threatened him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had not given way
to the Duke's threats. <div class="bookquote">``But I don't think I'm proud because chance
has made me my uncle's heir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least, I should say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do feel that a son to me is of more importance than it is
to most men. A strong anxiety on the subject, is, I think, more
excusable in me than it might be in another. I don't know whether I
quite make myself understood?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes! When there's a dukedom and heaven knows how many thousands
a year to be disposed of, the question of their future ownership does
become important.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This property is so much more interesting to one, if one feels that
all one does to it is done for one's own son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey, <div class="bookquote">``of all the great plunderers of property
throughout Europe, the Popes have been the most greedy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it's different, when a man can't have a wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Palliser.

<p/>From all this it may be seen that Mr. Palliser and Mr. Grey had become
very intimate. Had chance brought them together in London they might
have met a score of times before Mr. Palliser would have thought
of doing more than bowing to such an acquaintance. Mr. Grey might
have spent weeks at Matching, without having achieved anything like
intimacy with its noble owner. But things of that kind progress more
quickly abroad than they do at home. The deck of an ocean steamer is
perhaps the most prolific hotbed of the growth of sudden friendships;
but an hotel by the side of a Swiss lake does almost as well.

<p/>For some time after this Lady Glencora's conduct was frequently so
indiscreet as to drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband almost to frenzy. On the very day
after the news had been communicated to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) proposed a picnic,
and made the proposition not only in the presence of Alice, but in
that of Mr. Grey also! Mr. Palliser, on such an occasion, could not
express all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) thought; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) looked it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter, now, Plantagenet?''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>);--<div class="bookquote">``nothing. Never mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And shall we make this party up to the chapel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The chapel in question was Tell's chapel--ever so far up the lake. A
journey in a steam-boat would have been necessary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), shouting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) refusal at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We will not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't be angry about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>);--as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could have
failed to be stirred by such a proposition at such a time. On another
occasion she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) returned from an evening walk, showing on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face some
sign of the exercise she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had taken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good G--! Glencora,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``do you mean to kill yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to eat six or seven times a day; and always told her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was eating too much, remembering some ancient proverb about
little and often. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) now as closely as Mrs. Marsham and
Mr. Bott had watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) before; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) always knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) was doing
so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) made the matter worse by continually proposing to do things
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) would not permit, in order that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) might enjoy the
fun of seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) agony and amazement. But this, though it was fun to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) at the moment, produced anything but fun, as its general result.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, Alice, I think this will kill me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I am not
to stir out of the house now, unless I go in the carriage, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is
with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It won't last long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you call long. As for walking with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), it's out
of the question. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) goes about a mile an hour. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) makes me
look so much like a fool. I had no idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would be such an old
coddle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The coddling will all be given to some one else, very soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No baby could possibly live through it, if you mean that. If there
is a baby--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose there will be one, by-and-by,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be a fool! But, if there is, I shall take that matter into
my own hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) can do what he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) pleases with me, and I can't help
myself; but I shan't let him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) or anybody do what they please with my
baby. I know what I'm about in such matters a great deal better than
he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) does. I've no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'s a very clever man in Parliament; but he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
doesn't seem to me to understand anything else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice was making some very wise speech in answer to this, when Lady
Glencora interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Grey wouldn't make himself so troublesome, I'm quite sure.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Then
Alice held her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tongue.

<p/>When the first consternation arising from the news had somewhat
subsided,--say in a fortnight from the day in which Mr. Palliser was
made so triumphant,--and when tidings had been duly sent to the Duke,
and an answer from his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) Grace had come, arrangements were made for the
return of the party to England. The Duke's reply was very short:--


<p/>MY DEAR PLANTAGENET,--Give my kind love to Glencora. If
it's a boy, of course I will be one of the godfathers.
The Prince, who is very kind, will perhaps oblige me by
being the other. I should advise you to return as soon as
convenient.

<p/>Your affectionate uncle,

<p/>OMNIUM.


<p/>That was the letter; and short as it was, it was probably the longest
that Mr. Palliser had ever received from the Duke.

<p/>There was great trouble about the mode of their return.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``Let us get into an express
train, and go right through to London.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>Mr. Palliser looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
with a countenance full of rebuke and sorrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was always so
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) now. <div class="bookquote">``If you mean, Plantagenet, that we are to be
dragged all across the Continent in that horrible carriage, and be
a thousand days on the road, I for one won't submit to it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wish
I had never told him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) a word about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said afterwards to Alice.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would never have found it out himself, till this thing was all
over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Palliser did at last consent to take the joint opinion of a Swiss
doctor and an English one who was settled at Berne; and who, on the
occasion, was summoned to Lucerne. They suggested the railway; and as
letters arrived for Mr. Palliser,--medical letters,--in which the same
opinion was broached, it was agreed, at last, that they should return
by railway; but they were to make various halts on the road, stopping
at each halting-place for a day. The first was, of course, Basle, and
from Basle they were to go on to Baden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I particularly want to see Baden again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora said; <div class="bookquote">``and
perhaps I may be able to get back my napoleon.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXXIV.

<p/>Showing What Happened in the Churchyard.


<p/>These arrangements as to the return of Mr. Palliser's party to London
did not, of course, include Mr. Grey. They were generally discussed in
Mr. Grey's absence, and communicated to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) by Mr. Palliser. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose
we shall see you in England before long?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser. <div class="bookquote">``I shall
be able to tell you that before you go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey. <div class="bookquote">``Not but that in
any event I shall return to England before the winter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then come to us at Matching,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser. <div class="bookquote">``We shall be most
happy to have you. Say that you'll come for the first fortnight
in December. After that we always go to the Duke, in Barsetshire.
Though, by-the-by, I don't suppose we shall go anywhere this year,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>Mr. Palliser added, interrupting the warmth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) invitation, and
reflecting that, under the present circumstances, perhaps, it might
be improper to have any guests at Matching in December. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had
become very fond of Mr. Grey, and on this occasion, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had done on
some others, pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) warmly to make an attempt at Parliament. <div class="bookquote">``It
isn't nearly so difficult as you think,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), when Grey declared
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would not know where to look for a seat. <div class="bookquote">``See the men that
get in. There was Mr. Vavasor. Even he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) got a seat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had to pay for it very dearly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You might easily find some quiet little borough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quiet little boroughs have usually got their own quiet little
Members,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're fond of change; and if you like to spend a thousand pounds,
the thing isn't difficult. I'll put you in the way of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>But Mr.
Grey still declined. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was not a man prone to be talked out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
own way of life, and the very fact that George Vavasor had been in
Parliament would of itself have gone far towards preventing any
attempt on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) part in that direction. Alice had also wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) to
go into public life, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had put aside her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) request as though the
thing were quite out of the question,--never giving a moment to its
consideration. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) to settle himself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in Central
Africa, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) manner and mode of refusal would have been the same. It
was this immobility on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) part,--this absolute want of any of the
weakness of indecision, which had frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and driven her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) away
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was partly aware of this; but that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) had declined
to do at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) solicitation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) certainly would not do at the advice
of any one else. So it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) argued the matter with himself.
Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) now allowed himself to be so counselled, with what terrible
acknowledgements of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) own faults must he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) not have presented himself
before Alice?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose books, then, will be your object in life?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Palliser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope they will be my aids,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>Grey answered. <div class="bookquote">``I almost doubt whether
any object such as that you mean is necessary for life, or even
expedient. It seems to me that if a man can so train himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
may live honestly and die fearlessly, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has done about as much as is
necessary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has done a great deal, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser, who was
not ready enough to carry on the argument as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) might have done had
more time been given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) to consider it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) knew very well that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) himself was working for others, and not for himself; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was
aware, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had not analysed his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) own convictions on the matter,
that good men struggle as they do in order that others, besides
themselves, may live honestly, and, if possible, die fearlessly. The
recluse of Nethercoats had thought much more about all this than the
rising star of the House of Commons; but the philosophy of the rising
star was the better philosophy of the two, though he (<font color='blue'><b>recluse</b></font>) was by far the
less brilliant man. <div class="bookquote">``I don't see why a man should not live honestly
and be a Member of Parliament as well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Palliser, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had been silent for a few minutes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Grey. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure that there are such men, and
that the country is under great obligation to them. But they are
subject to temptations which a prudent man like myself may perhaps
do well to avoid.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) spoke with an assured tone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was
shaken, and almost regretted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) did not accept the aid which was
offered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). It is astonishing how strong a man may be to those
around him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--how impregnable may be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) exterior, while within he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
feels himself to be as weak as water, and as unstable as chaff.

<p/>But the object which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had now in view was a renewal of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
engagement with Alice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must obtain an answer from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) before they left Lucerne. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) still persisted in refusing to
give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand, it would not be consistent with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dignity as
a man to continue his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) immediate pursuit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) any longer. In such
case he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and see what future time might bring forth.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed himself to be aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would never offer his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love
to another woman; and if Alice were to remain single, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might try
again, after the lapse of a year or two. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) failed now,--then,
for that year or two, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would see her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) no more. Having so resolved,
and being averse to anything like a surprise, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) one evening, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would walk with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on the
following morning. That morning would be the morning of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) last day
at Lucerne; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) assented she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew well what was to come. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
said nothing to Lady Glencora on the subject, but allowed the coming
prospects of the Palliser family to form the sole subject of their
conversation that night, as it had done on every night since the
great news had become known. They were always together for an hour
every evening before Alice was allowed to go to bed, and during
this hour the anxieties of the future father and mother were always
discussed till Alice Vavasor was almost tired of them. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was
patient with her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) friend, and on this special night she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was patient
as ever. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was released and was alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) made a great
endeavour to come to some fixed resolution as to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) would do on
the morrow,--some resolution which should be absolutely resolute, and
from which no eloquence on the part of any one should move her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>). But
such resolutions are not easily reached, and Alice laboured through
half the night almost in vain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) loved the man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was as true to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) as the sun is true to the earth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would be, in all respects, safe in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew
that Lady Glencora would be delighted, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) father gratified. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
knew that the countesses would open their arms to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>),--though I
doubt whether this knowledge was in itself very persuasive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) knew
that by such a marriage she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would gain all that women generally look
to gain when they give themselves away. But, nevertheless, as far as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could decide at all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) decided against her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) lover. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had no
right of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) own to be taken back after the evil that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had done,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) did not choose to be taken back as an object of pity and
forgiveness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going?''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) cousin, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) came in with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) hat
on, soon after breakfast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to walk,--with Mr. Grey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By appointment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, by appointment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) asked me yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it's all settled, and you haven't told me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All that is settled I have told you very often. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) asked me
yesterday to walk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) this morning, and I could not well refuse
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you have wished to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't said that I did wish it. But I hate scenes, and I think it
would have been pleasanter for us to have parted without any occasion
for special words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice, you are such a fool!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you tell me very often.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) is now going to say the very thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) has come
all this way for the purpose of saying. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) has been wonderfully slow
about it; but then slow as he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) is, you are slower. If you don't make
it up with him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) now, I really shall think you are very wicked. I am
becoming like Lady Midlothian;--I can't understand it. I know you
want to be his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) wife, and I know he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) wants to be your husband, and the
only thing that keeps you apart is your obstinacy,--just because you
have said you wouldn't have him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>). My belief is that if Lady Midlothian
and the rest of us were to pat you on the back, and tell you how
right you were, you'd ask him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) to take you, out of defiance. You may
be sure of this, Alice; if you refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) now, it'll be for the last
time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This, and much more of the same kind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) bore before Mr. Grey came
to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) answered to it all as little as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could. <div class="bookquote">``You
are making me very unhappy, Glencora,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said once. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I could
break you down with unhappiness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora answered, <div class="bookquote">``so that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
might find you less stiff, and hard, and unmanageable.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Directly upon
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) came in, looking as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had no business on hand more
exciting than his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) ordinary morning's tranquil employments. Alice at
once got up to start with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``So you and Alice are going to make
your adieux,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``It must be done sooner or later,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grey; and then they went off.

<p/>Those who know Lucerne,--and almost everybody now does know
Lucerne,--will remember the big hotel which has been built close to
the landing-pier of the steamers, and will remember also the church
that stands upon a little hill or rising ground, to the left of you,
as you come out of the inn upon the lake. The church is immediately
over the lake, and round the church there is a burying-ground,
and skirting the burying-ground there are cloisters, through the
arches and apertures of which they who walk and sit there look down
immediately upon the blue water, and across the water upon the
frowning menaces of Mount Pilate. It is one of the prettiest spots in
that land of beauty; and its charm is to my feeling enhanced by the
sepulchral monuments over which I walk, and by which I am surrounded,
as I stand there. Up here, into these cloisters, Alice and John Grey
went together. I doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had formed any purpose of doing
so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) certainly would have gone without question in any direction
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) might have led her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). The distance from the inn up to the
church-gate did not take them ten minutes, and when they were there
their walk was over. But the place was solitary, and they were alone;
and it might be as well for Mr. Grey to speak what words he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had to say
there as elsewhere. They had often been together in those cloisters
before, but on such occasions either Mr. Palliser or Lady Glencora
had been with them. On their slow passage up the hill very little was
spoken, and that little was of no moment. <div class="bookquote">``We will go in here for a
few minutes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It is the prettiest spot about Lucerne, and
we don't know when we may see it again.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>So they went in, and sat
down on one of the embrasures that open from the cloisters over the
lake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Probably never again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">``And yet I have been here now two
years running.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) shuddered as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) remembered that in that former year George
Vavasor had been with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). As she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought of it all she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hated
herself. Over and over again she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had told herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had so
mismanaged the latter years of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) life that it was impossible for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) not to hate herself. No woman had a clearer idea of feminine
constancy than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had, and no woman had sinned against that idea
more deeply. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) time to think of all this as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) sat there
looking down upon the water.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet I would sooner live in Cambridgeshire,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>were the first words
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Partly because all beauty is best enjoyed when it is sought for with
some trouble and difficulty, and partly because such beauty, and the
romance which is attached to it, should not make up the staple of
one's life. Romance, if it is to come at all, should always come by
fits and starts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to live in a pretty country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And would like to live a romantic life,--no doubt; but all those
things lose their charm if they are made common. When a man has to
go to Vienna or St. Petersburg two or three times a month, you don't
suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enjoys travelling?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the same, I should like to live in a pretty country,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said
Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I want you to come and live in a very ugly country.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)
paused for a minute or two, not looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), but gazing still on
the mountain opposite. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not speak a word, but looked as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) was
looking. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew that the request was coming, and had been thinking
about it all night; but now that it had come she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not know how to
bear herself. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) went on to say, <div class="bookquote">``that you would let
that consideration stand in your way, if on other grounds you were
willing to become my wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What consideration?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because Nethercoats is not so pretty as Lucerne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would have nothing to do with it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It should have nothing to do with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing; nothing at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>repeated Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you come, then? Will you come and be my wife, and help me to be
happy amidst all that ugliness? Will you come and be my one beautiful
thing, my treasure, my joy, my comfort, my counsellor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You want no counsellor, Mr. Grey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No man ever wanted one more. Alice, this has been a bad year to me,
and I do not think that it has been a happy one for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us forget it,--or rather, let us treat it as though it were
forgotten. Twelve months ago you were mine. You were, at any rate,
so much mine that I had a right to boast of my possession among my
friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a poor boast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They did not seem to think so. I had but one or two to whom I could
speak of you, but they told me that I was going to be a happy man.
As to myself, I was sure that I was to be so. No man was ever better
contented with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bargain than I was with mine. Let us go back to
it, and the last twelve months shall be as though they had never
been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That cannot be, Mr. Grey. If it could, I should be worse even than
I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why cannot it be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I cannot forgive myself what I have done, and because you
ought not to forgive me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do. There has never been an hour with me in which there has
been an offence of yours rankling in my bosom unforgiven. I think you
have been foolish, misguided,--led away by a vain ambition, and that
in the difficulty to which these things brought you, you endeavoured
to constrain yourself to do an act, which, when it came near to
you,--when the doing of it had to be more closely considered, you
found to be contrary to your nature.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Now, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) spoke thus, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>), and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>), wondering that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) should
have had power to read her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heart so accurately. <div class="bookquote">``I never believed
that you would marry your cousin. When I was told of it, I knew that
trouble had blinded you for awhile. You had driven yourself to revolt
against me, and upon that your heart misgave you, and you said to
yourself that it did not matter then how you might throw away all
your sweetness. You see that I speak of your old love for me with the
frank conceit of a happy lover.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--no, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ejaculated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the storm passes over the tree and does not tear it up by
the roots or spoil it of all its symmetry. When we hear the winds
blowing, and see how the poor thing is shaken, we think that its
days are numbered and its destruction at hand. Alice, when the
winds were shaking you, and you were torn and buffeted, I never
thought so. There may be some who will forgive you slowly. Your own
self-forgiveness will be slow. But I, who have known you better than
any one,--yes, better than any one,--I have forgiven you everything,
have forgiven you instantly. Come to me, Alice, and comfort me. Come
to me, for I want you sorely.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat quite still, looking at the
lake and the mountain beyond, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said nothing. What could she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>)? <div class="bookquote">``My need of you is much greater now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) went on to say,
<div class="bookquote">``than when I first asked you to share the world with me. Then I could
have borne to lose you, as I had never boasted to myself that you
were my own,--had never pictured to myself the life that might be
mine if you were always to be with me. But since that day I have had
no other hope,--no other hope but this for which I plead now. Am I to
plead in vain?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not know me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``how vile I have been! You do not
think what it is,--for a woman to have promised herself to one man
while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loved another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it was me you loved. Ah! Alice, I can forgive that. Do I not
tell you that I did forgive it the moment that I heard it? Do you not
hear me say that I never for a moment thought that you would marry
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? Alice, you should scold me for my vanity, for I have believed
all through that you loved me, and me only. Come to me, dear, and
tell me that it is so, and the past shall be only as a dream.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am dreaming it always,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They will cease to be bitter dreams if your head be upon my
shoulder. You will cease to reproach yourself when you know that you
have made me happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never cease to reproach myself. I have done that which no
woman can do and honour herself afterwards. I have been--a jilt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The noblest jilt that ever yet halted between two minds! There has
been no touch of selfishness in your fickleness. I think I could be
hard enough upon a woman who had left me for greater wealth, for a
higher rank,--who had left me even that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might be gay and merry.
It has not been so with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it has. I thought you were too firm in your own will, and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you think so still. Is that it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It does not matter what I think now. I am a fallen creature, and
have no longer a right to such thoughts. It will be better for us
both that you should leave me,--and forget me. There are things
which, if a woman does them, should never be forgotten;--which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
should never permit herself to forget.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And am I to be punished, then, because of your fault? Is that your
sense of justice?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) got up, and standing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), looked down
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Alice, if you will tell me that you do not love me, I will
believe you, and will trouble you no more. I know that you will say
nothing to me that is false. Through it all you have spoken no word
of falsehood. If you love me, after what has passed, I have a right
to demand your hand. My happiness requires it, and I have a right
to expect your compliance. I do demand it. If you love me, Alice,
I tell you that you dare not refuse me. If you do so, you will fail
hereafter to reconcile it to your conscience before God.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) speech, and waited for a reply; but Alice sat
silent beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) gaze, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes turned upon the tombstones
beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) feet. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had no choice but to yield. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>),
possessed of power and force infinitely greater than hers, had left
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) no alternative but to be happy. But there still clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) what
I fear we must call a perverseness of obstinacy, a desire to maintain
the resolution she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had made,--a wish that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might be allowed to
undergo the punishment she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had deserved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was as a prisoner who
would fain cling to his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) prison after pardon has reached him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), because
he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) is conscious that the pardon is undeserved. And it may be that
there was still left within her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) bosom some remnant of that feeling
of rebellion which his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) masterful spirit had ever produced in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
was so imperious in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) tranquillity, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) argued his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) question of love
with such a manifest preponderance of right on his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) side, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
always felt that to yield to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would be to confess the omnipotence
of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) power. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) must yield to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>),--that his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
power over her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was omnipotent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was pressed by him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) as in some
countries the prisoner is pressed by the judge,--so pressed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
acknowledged to herself silently that any further antagonism to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
was impossible. Nevertheless, the word which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had to speak still
remained unspoken, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) stood over her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) answer.
Then slowly he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) sat down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and gradually he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) arm
round her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) waist. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) shrank from him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), back against the stonework of
the embrasure, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not shrink away from his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) grasp. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) put
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand to impede his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), but his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hand, like his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) character and his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
words, was full of power. It would not be impeded. <div class="bookquote">``Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) said,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) close with his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) arm, <div class="bookquote">``the battle is over now, and I
have won it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You win everything,--always,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, whispering to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
still shrank from his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) embrace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In winning you I have won everything.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) face over her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
and pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) lips to hers. I wonder whether he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was made happier
when he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) knew that no other touch had profaned those lips since last
he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had pressed them?




<p/>CHAPTER LXXV.

<p/>Rouge et Noir.


<p/>Alice insisted on being left up in the churchyard, urging that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
wanted to <div class="bookquote">``think about it all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but, in truth, fearing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might
not be able to carry herself well, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) were to walk down with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
lover to the hotel. To this he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) made no objection, and, on reaching
the inn, met Mr. Palliser in the hall. Mr. Palliser was already
inspecting the arrangement of certain large trunks which had been
brought down-stairs, and was preparing for their departure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was
going about the house, with a nervous solicitude to do something,
and was flattering himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was of use. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could not
be Chancellor of the Exchequer, and as, by the nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>)
disposition, some employment was necessary to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) was looking to
the cording of the boxes. <div class="bookquote">``Good morning! good morning!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) said to
Grey, hardly looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>), as though time were too precious with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) to allow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) eyes upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) friend. <div class="bookquote">``I am going up
to the station to see after a carriage for to-morrow. Perhaps you'll
come with me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>To this proposition Mr. Grey assented. <div class="bookquote">``Sometimes, you
know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Palliser, <div class="bookquote">``the springs of the carriages are so
very rough.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>Then, in a very few words, Mr. Grey told him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) what had
been his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) own morning's work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) hated secrets and secrecy, and as the
Pallisers knew well what had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) upon their track, it was,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) thought, well that they should know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had been successful.
Mr. Palliser congratulated him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) very cordially, and then, running
up-stairs for his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) gloves or his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) stick, or, more probably, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
might give his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife one other caution as to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) care of herself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
told her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) also that Alice had yielded at last. <div class="bookquote">``Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) has,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I really didn't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's because you don't understand things of that sort,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said
his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife. Then the caution was repeated, the mother of the future
duke was kissed, and Mr. Palliser went off on his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) mission about the
carriage, its cushions, and its springs. In the course of their walk
Mr. Palliser suggested that, as things were settled so pleasantly,
Mr. Grey might as well return with them to England, and to this
suggestion Mr. Grey assented.

<p/>Alice remained alone for nearly an hour, looking out upon the rough
sides and gloomy top of Mount Pilate. No one disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in the
churchyard,--no steps were heard along the tombstones,--no voice
sounded through the cloisters. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was left in perfect solitude to
think of the past, and form her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) plans of the future. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) happy,
now that the manner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) life to come was thus settled for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>);
that all further question as to the disposal of herself was taken
out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hands, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) marriage with a man she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) loved was so
firmly arranged that no further folly of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own could disarrange
it? She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was happy, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was slow to confess her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) happiness to
herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was happy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was resolute in this,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would
now do all she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) happy also. And there must now,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) acknowledged, be an end to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) pride,--to that pride which had
hitherto taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could more wisely follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
own guidance than that of any other who might claim to guide her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
knew now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) must follow his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guidance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) master,
as we sometimes say, and laughed to herself with a little inward
laughter as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) confessed that it was so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was from henceforth
altogether in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chose to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that they were to be
married at Michaelmas, or at Christmas, or on Lady Day, they would,
of course, be married accordingly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) fling at having
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) own will, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) friends had seen what had come of
it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had assumed the command of the ship, and had thrown it upon
the rocks, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) never ought to take the captain's
place again. It was well for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) who was to be captain was
one whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) respected as thoroughly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) would write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) father at once,--to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) father and Lady
Macleod,--and would confess everything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) owed it to
them that they should be told by herself that they had been right and
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had been wrong. Hitherto she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had not mentioned to either of
them the fact that Mr. Grey was with them in Switzerland. And, then,
what must she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) do as to Lady Midlothian? As to Lady Midlothian, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
would do nothing. Lady Midlothian, of course, would triumph;--would
jump upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), as Lady Glencora had once expressed it, with very
triumphant heels,--would try to patronize her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), or, which would be
almost worse, would make a parade of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) forgiveness. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would
have nothing to do with Lady Midlothian, unless, indeed, Mr. Grey
should order it. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) laughed at herself again with that inward
laughter, and, rising from her (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) seat, proceeded to walk down the hill
to the hotel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vanquished at last!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, as Alice entered the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, vanquished; if you like to call it so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not what I call it, but what you feel it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you think that I don't know you well enough to be sure that you
regard yourself now as an unfortunate prisoner,--as a captive taken
in war, to be led away in triumph, without any hope of a ransom? I
know that it is quite a misery to you that you should be made a happy
woman of at last. I understand it all, my dear, and my heart bleeds
for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course; I knew that was the way you would treat me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In what way would you have me treat you? If I were to hug you with
joy, and tell you how good he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) is, and how fortunate you are,--if I
were to praise him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), and bid you triumph in your success, as might be
expected on such an occasion,--you would put on a long face at once,
and tell me that though the thing is to be, it would be much better
that the thing shouldn't be. Don't I know you, Alice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't have said that;--not now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe in my heart you would;--that, or something like it. But I
do wish you joy all the same, and you may say what you please. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has
got you in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) power now, and I don't think even you can go back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I shall not go back again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would join with Lady Midlothian in putting you into a madhouse,
if you did. But I am so glad; I am, indeed. I was afraid to the
last,--terribly afraid; you are so hard and so proud. I don't mean
hard to me, dear. You have never been half hard enough to me. But you
are hard to yourself, and, upon my word, you have been hard to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
What a deal you will have to make up to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel that I ought to stand before him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) always as a penitent,--in a
white sheet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will like it better, I dare say, if you will sit upon his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) knee.
Some penitents do, you know. And how happy you will be! He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll never
explain the sugar-duties to you, and there'll be no Mr. Bott at
Nethercoats.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>They sat together the whole morning,--while Mr. Palliser
was seeing to the springs and cushions,--and by degrees Alice began
to enjoy her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) happiness. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did so her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) friend enjoyed it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),
and at last they had something of the comfort and excitement which
such an occasion should give. <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what, Alice; you shall
come and be married at Matching, in August, or perhaps September.
That's the only way in which I can be present; and if we can bespeak
some sun, we'll have the breakfast out in the ruins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/>On the following morning they all started together, a first-class
compartment having been taken for the Palliser family, and a
second-class compartment close to them for the Palliser servants. Mr.
Palliser, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) slowly handed his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife in, was a triumphant man; as
was also Mr. Grey, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) handed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) lady-love, though, in a manner,
much less manifest. We may say that both the gentlemen had been
very fortunate while at Lucerne. Mr. Palliser had come abroad with a
feeling that all the world had been cut from under his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) feet. A great
change was needed for his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had acknowledged at once that
everything must be made to yield to that necessity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) certainly
had his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) reward,--now in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) triumphant return. Terrible troubles
had afflicted him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) went, which seemed now to have dissipated
themselves altogether. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) thought of Burgo Fitzgerald he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
remembered him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) only as a poor, unfortunate fellow, for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) should
be glad to do something, if the doing of anything were only in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
power; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) pocket a letter which he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had that morning
received from the Duke of St. Bungay, marked private and confidential,
which was in its nature very private and confidential, and in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was told that Lord Brock and Mr. Finespun were totally at variance
about French wines. Mr. Finespun wanted to do something, now in the
recess,--to send some political agent over to France,--to which Lord
Brock would not agree; and no one knew what would be the consequence
of this disagreement. Here might be another chance,--if only Mr.
Palliser could give up his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) winter in Italy! Mr. Palliser, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) took
his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) place opposite his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife, was very triumphant.

<p/>And Mr. Grey was triumphant, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) placed himself gently in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) seat
opposite to Alice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) seemed to assume no right, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) took that
position apparently because it was the one which came naturally to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) lot. No one would have been made aware that Alice was his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) own
simply by seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) arrangements for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) comfort. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) made no loud
assertion as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) property and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) rights, as some men do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was
quiet and subdued in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) joy, but not the less was he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) triumphant.
From the day on which Alice had accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) first offer,--nay, from
an earlier day than that; from the day on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had first resolved
to make it, down to the present hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had never been stirred from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) purpose. By every word that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had said, and by every act that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
had done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had shown himself to be unmoved by that episode in their
joint lives, which Alice's other friends had regarded as so fatal.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) first rejected him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would not take his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) rejection. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) intended to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) silently
declined to believe that such marriage would ever take place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had
never given her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) up for a day, and now the event proved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had
been right. Alice was happy, very happy; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was still disposed
to regard her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) lover as Fate, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) happiness as an enforced
necessity.

<p/>They stopped a night at Basle, and again she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) stood upon the balcony.
He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) stood there,--so close that, putting out
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand for his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was able to take it and press it closely. <div class="bookquote">``You
are thinking of something, Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said--<div class="bookquote">``here, on this very balcony, that I first
rebelled against you, and now you have brought me here that I should
confess and submit on the same spot. I do confess. How am I to thank
you for forgiving me?''


 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``How am I to thank you for forgiving me?'' (<font color='red'><b>a couple</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/>On the following morning they went on to Baden-Baden, and there they
stopped for a couple of days. Lady Glencora had positively refused
to stop a day at Basle, making so many objections to the place that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband had at last yielded. <div class="bookquote">``I could go from Vienna to London
without feeling it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said, with indignation; <div class="bookquote">``and to tell me that
I can't do two easy days' journey running!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mr. Palliser had been
afraid to be imperious, and therefore, immediately on his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) arrival at
one of the stations in Basle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had posted across the town, in the
heat and the dust, to look after the cushions and the springs at the
other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've a particular favour to ask of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora said to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband, as soon as they were alone together in their rooms at
Baden. Mr. Palliser declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would grant her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) any particular
favour,--only premising that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was not to be supposed to have
thereby committed himself to any engagement under which his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife
should have authority to take any exertion upon herself. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I
were a milkmaid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are not a milkmaid, my dear. You haven't been brought up
like a milkmaid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But what was the favour? If she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would only ask for jewels,--though
they were the Grand Duchess's diamond eardrops, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would endeavour
to get them for her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) would have quaffed molten pearls, like
Cleopatra, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would have procured the beverage,--having first
fortified himself with a medical opinion as to the fitness of the
drink for a lady in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) condition. There was no expenditure that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would not willingly incur for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), nothing costly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would
grudge. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) asked for a favour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was always afraid of an
imprudence. Very possibly she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might want to drink beer in an open
garden.

<p/>And her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) request was, at last, of this nature: <div class="bookquote">``I want you to take me
up to the gambling-rooms!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The gambling-rooms!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser in dismay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Plantagenet; the gambling-rooms. If you had been with me
before, I should not have made a fool of myself by putting my piece
of money on the table. I want to see the place; but then I saw
nothing, because I was so frightened when I found that I was
winning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Palliser was aware that all the world of Baden,--or rather the
world of the strangers at Baden,--assembles itself in those salons.
It may be also that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) himself was curious to see how men looked
when they lost their own money, or won that of others. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) knew how a
Minister looked when he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) lost or gained a tax. He (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) was familiar with
millions and tens of millions in a committee of the whole House. He (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>)
knew the excitement of a near division upon the estimates. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>)
had never yet seen a poor man stake his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) last napoleon, and rake back
from off the table a small hatful of gold. A little exercise after an
early dinner was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) had been told, good for his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) wife; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) agreed
therefore that, on their second evening at Baden, they would all walk
up and see the play.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I shall get back my napoleon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Glencora to Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And perhaps I shall be forgiven when somebody sees how difficult it
is to manage you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, looking at Mr. Palliser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) isn't in earnest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser, almost fearing the result
of the experiment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/>They started together, Mr. Palliser with his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife, and Mr. Grey with
Alice on his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) arm, and found all the tables at work. They at first
walked through the different rooms, whispering to each other their
comments on the people that they saw, and listening to the quick,
low, monotonous words of the croupiers as they arranged and presided
over the games. Each table was closely surrounded by its own crowd,
made up of players, embryo players, and simple lookers-on, so that
they could not see much as they walked. But this was not enough for
Lady Glencora. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was anxious to know what these men and women were
doing,--to see whether the croupiers wore horns on their heads and
were devils indeed,--to behold the faces of those who were wretched
and of those who were triumphant,--to know how the thing was
done, and to learn something of that lesson in life. <div class="bookquote">``Let us stand
here a moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband, arresting him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) at one corner
of the table which had the greatest crowd. <div class="bookquote">``We shall be able to see
in a few minutes.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) there, giving way to Alice,
who went in front with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife; and in a minute or two an aperture
was made, so that they could all see the marked cloth, and the money
lying about, and the rakes on the table, and the croupier skilfully
dealing his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cards, and,--more interesting than all the rest, the
faces of those who were playing. Grey looked on, over Alice's
shoulder, very attentively,--as did Palliser also,--but both of them
kept their eyes upon the ministers of the work. Alice and Glencora
did the same at first, but as they gained courage they glanced round
upon the gamblers.

<p/>It was a long table, having, of course, four corners, and at the
corner appropriated by them they were partly opposite to the man who
dealt the cards. The corner answering to theirs at the other end was
the part of the table most removed from their sight, and that on
which their eyes fell last. As Lady Glencora stood she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could hardly
see,--indeed, at first she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could not see,--one or two who were
congregated at this spot. Mr. Palliser, who was behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), could not
see them at all. But to Alice,--and to Mr. Grey, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) cared about
it,--every face at the table was visible except the faces of those
who were immediately close to them. Before long Alice's attention
was riveted on the action and countenance of one young man who sat
at that other corner. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was leaning, at first listlessly, over the
table, dressed in a velveteen jacket, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) round-topped hat
brought far over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not fully see his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had hardly begun to observe him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) threw back his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
hat, and taking some pieces of gold from under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left hand, which
lay upon the table, pushed three or four of them on to one of the
divisions marked on the cloth. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to show no care, as others
did, as to the special spot which they should occupy. Many were very
particular in this respect, placing their ventures on the lines, so
as to share the fortunes of two compartments, or sometimes of four;
or they divided their coins, taking three or four numbers, selecting
the numbers with almost grotesque attention to some imagined rule of
their own. But this man let his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gold go all together, and left it
where his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) half-stretched rake deposited it by chance. Alice could
not but look at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could see were bloodshot, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pushed back his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat, was rough and dishevelled;
but still there was that in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face which no woman could see and
not regard. It was a face which at once prepossessed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
favour,--as it had always prepossessed all others. On this occasion
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had won his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money, and Alice saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drag it in as lazily as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had pushed it out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you see that little Frenchman?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) has
just made half a napoleon, and has walked off with it. Isn't it
interesting? I could stay here all the night.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) turned round
to whisper something to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband, and Alice's eyes again fell on
the face of the man at the other end of the table. After he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had won
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had allowed the game to go on for a turn without any
action on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) part. The gold again went under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
lounged forward with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes. One of the croupiers had
said a word, as though calling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attention to the game, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had merely shaken his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head. But when the fate of the next turn had
been decided, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again roused himself, and on this occasion, as far
as Alice could see, pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole stock forward with the rake.
There was a little mass of gold, and, from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner of placing it,
all might see that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left its position to chance. One piece had
got beyond its boundary, and the croupier pushed it back with some
half-expressed inquiry as to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) correctness. <div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a
voice in English. Then Lady Glencora started and clutched Alice's arm
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand. Mr. Palliser was explaining to Mr. Grey, behind them,
something about German finance as connected with gambling-tables, and
did not hear the voice, or see his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife's motion. I need hardly tell
the reader that the gambler was Burgo Fitzgerald.

<p/>But Lady Glencora said not a word,--not as yet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) looked forward
very gently, but still with eager eyes, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) could just see
the face she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) knew so well. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) hat was now pushed back, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>)
countenance had lost its listlessness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) watched narrowly the face
of the man as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) told out the amount of the cards as they were dealt.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) did not try to hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) anxiety, and when, after the telling of
some six or seven cards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) heard a certain number named, and a
certain colour called, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) made some exclamation which even Glencora
could not hear. And then another croupier put down, close to Burgo's
money, certain rolls of gold done up in paper, and also certain loose
napoleons.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) take it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) is taking it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, not at all knowing the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
cousin's anxiety.

<p/>Burgo had paused a moment, and then prepared to rake the money to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>); but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) did so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) mind, and pushed it all back
again,--now, on this occasion, being very careful to place it on its
former spot. Both Alice and Glencora could see that a man at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
elbow was dissuading him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--had even attempted to stop the arm which
held the rake. But Burgo shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) off, speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) some word
roughly, and then again he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) steadied the rolls upon their appointed
place. The croupier who had paused for a moment now went on quickly
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) cards, and in two minutes the fate of Burgo's wealth was
decided. It was all drawn back by the croupier's unimpassioned rake,
and the rolls of gold were restored to the tray from whence they had
been taken.

<p/>Burgo looked up and smiled at them all round the table. By this
time most of those who stood around were looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was a
man who gathered eyes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) might be, or whatever
he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was doing; and it had been clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was very intent upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) fortune, and on the last occasion the amount staked had been
considerable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) knew that men and women were looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), and
therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) smiled faintly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) eyes round the table.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) got up, and, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) trousers pockets,
whistled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) walked away. His (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) companion followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), and laid a
hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) shoulder; but Burgo shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) off, and would not turn
round. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) off, and walked on whistling, the length of the
whole salon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, <div class="bookquote">``it is Burgo Fitzgerald.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Mr. Palliser
had gone so deep into that question of German finance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had not
at all noticed the gambler. <div class="bookquote">``Alice, what can we do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>)? It is
Burgo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/>Many eyes were now watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). Used as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was to the world and to
misfortune, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was not successful in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) attempt to bear his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) loss
with a show of indifference. The motion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) head, the position of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hands, the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) whistling, all told the tale. Even the
unimpassioned croupiers furtively cast an eye after him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), and a very
big Guard, in a cocked hat, and uniform, and sword, who hitherto
had hardly been awake, seemed evidently to be interested by his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
movements. If there is to be a tragedy at these places,--and
tragedies will sometimes occur,--it is always as well that the tragic
scene should be as far removed as possible from the salons, in order
that the public eye should not suffer.

<p/>Lady Glencora and Alice had left their places, and had shrunk back,
almost behind a pillar. <div class="bookquote">``Is it he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), in truth?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In very truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``What can I do? Can I do anything?
Look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), Alice. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) were to destroy himself, what should I do
then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div><p/>Burgo, conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was the regarded of all eyes, turned round
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) heel and again walked the length of the salon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) knew well
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had not a franc left in his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) possession, but still he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) laughed
and still he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) whistled. His (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) companion, whoever he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) might be, had slunk
away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), not caring to share the notoriety which now attended
him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall I do, Alice?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) eyes still
fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) who had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) lover.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell Mr. Palliser,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>whispered Alice.

<p/>Lady Glencora immediately ran up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband, and took him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) away
from Mr. Grey. Rapidly she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) story,--with such rapidity that Mr.
Palliser could hardly get in a word. <div class="bookquote">``Do something for him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>);--do, do.
Unless I know that something is done, I shall die. You needn't be
afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser.

<p/>Lady Glencora, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) went on quickly, got hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband's
hand, and caressed it. <div class="bookquote">``You are so good,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Don't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
out of your sight. There; he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) is going. I will go home with Mr. Grey.
I will be ever so good; I will, indeed. You know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)'ll want, and
for my sake you'll let him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) have it. But don't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) gamble. If you
could only get him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) home to England, and then do something. You owe
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) something, Plantagenet; do you not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If money can do anything, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) shall have it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you, dearest! I shall never see him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) again; but if you
could save him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)! There;--he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is going now. Go;--go.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
forward, and then retreating, put her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) arm within Mr. Grey's, still
keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) eye upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband.

<p/>Burgo, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) first got to the door leading out of the salon,
had paused a moment, and, turning round, had encountered the big
gendarme close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Well, old Buffer, what do you want?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), accosting the man in English. The big gendarme simply walked on
through the door, and said nothing. Then Burgo also passed out, and
Mr. Palliser quickly went after him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). They were now in the large front
salon, from whence the chief door of the building opened out upon the
steps. Through this door Burgo went without pausing, and Mr. Palliser
went after him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). They both walked to the end of the row of buildings,
and then Burgo, leaving the broad way, turned into a little path
which led up through the trees to the hills. That hillside among the
trees is a popular resort at Baden, during the day; but now, at nine
in the evening, it was deserted. Palliser did not press on the other
man, but followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), and did not accost Burgo till he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had thrown
himself on the grass beneath a tree.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are in trouble, I fear, Mr. Fitzgerald,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser, as
soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was close at Burgo's feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will go home. Mr. Palliser has something to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady
Glencora to Mr. Grey, as soon as the two men had disappeared from her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
sight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that a friend of Mr. Palliser?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--that is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) knows him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), and is interested about him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). Alice,
shall we go home? Oh! Mr. Grey, you must not ask any questions.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>),--Mr. Palliser, will tell you everything when he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) sees you,--that
is, if there is anything to be told.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then they all went home, and
soon separated for the night. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I shall sit up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora to Alice, <div class="bookquote">``but I will do it in my own room. You
can tell Mr. Grey, if you like.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>But Alice told nothing to Mr. Grey,
nor did Mr. Grey ask any questions.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXVI.

<p/>The Landlord's Bill.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are in trouble, Mr. Fitzgerald, I fear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser,
standing over Burgo as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) lay upon the ground. They were now
altogether beyond the gas-lights, and the evening was dark. Burgo,
too, was lying with his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) face to the ground, expecting that the
footsteps which he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) had heard would pass by him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>), turning round suddenly; but still he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was not
at once able to recognize Mr. Palliser, whose voice was hardly known
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I have been wrong in following you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser, <div class="bookquote">``but
I thought you were in distress, and that probably I might help you.
My name is Palliser.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Plantagenet Palliser?''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo, jumping up on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) legs and
looking close into the other's face. <div class="bookquote">``By heavens! it is Plantagenet
Palliser! Well, Mr. Palliser, what do you want of me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to be of some use to you, if I can. I and my wife saw you
leave the gaming-table just now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) here too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is here. We are going home, but chance brought us up to
the salon. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) seemed to think that you are in distress, and that I
could help you. I will, if you will let me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Palliser, during the whole interview, felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could afford to
be generous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had no further cause for fear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had no
lingering dread of this poor creature who stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). All that
feeling was over, though it was as yet hardly four months since he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
had been sent back by Mrs. Marsham to Lady Monk's house to save his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
wife, if saving her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) were yet possible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is here, is she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>);--and saw me there when I staked my last
chance? I should have had over twenty thousand francs now, if the
cards had stood to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The cards never do stand to any one, Mr. Fitzgerald.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never;--never,--never!''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo. <div class="bookquote">``At any rate, they never did to
me. Nothing ever does stand to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you want twenty thousand francs,--that's eight hundred pounds, I
think--I can let you have it without any trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The devil you can!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes. As I am travelling with my family--''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wonder whether Mr.
Palliser considered himself to be better entitled to talk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
family than he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had been some three or four weeks back--<div class="bookquote">``As I am
travelling with my family, I have been obliged to carry large bills
with me, and I can accommodate you without any trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something pleasant in this, which made Burgo Fitzgerald
laugh. Mr. Palliser, the husband of Lady Glencora M``Cluskie, and the
heir of the Duke of Omnium happening to have money with him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>)! As if
Mr. Palliser could not bring down showers of money in any quarter
of the globe by simply holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hand. And then to talk of
accommodating him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>),--Burgo Fitzgerald, as though it were simply a
little matter of convenience,--as though Mr. Palliser would of course
find the money at his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) bankers' when he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) next examined his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) book! Burgo
could not but laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not in the least doubting your ability to raise the money,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but how would you propose to get it back again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be at your convenience,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser, who hardly
knew how to put himself on a proper footing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) companion, so
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) might offer to do something effectual for the man's aid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never have any such convenience,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo. <div class="bookquote">``Who were those
women whose tubs always had holes at the bottom of them? My tub
always has such a hole.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean the daughters of Danaus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know whose daughters they were, but you might just as well
lend them all eight hundred pounds apiece.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There were so many of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser, trying a little joke.
<div class="bookquote">``But as you are only one I shall be most happy, as I said before, to
be of service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were now walking slowly together up towards the hills, and near
to them they heard a step. Upon this, Burgo turned round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you see that fellow?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>). Mr. Palliser, who was somewhat
short-sighted, said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) did not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I do, though. I don't
know his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) name, but they have sent him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) out from the hotel with me, to
see what I do with myself. I owe them six or seven hundred francs,
and they want to turn me out of the house and not let me take my
things with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be very uncomfortable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be uncomfortable, but I shall be too many for them. If they
keep my traps they shall keep me. They think I'm going to blow my
brains out. That's what they think. The man lets me go far enough off
to do that,--so long as it's nowhere about the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you're not thinking of such a thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As long as I can help it, Mr. Palliser, I never think of anything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The stranger</b></font>)</div>The stranger was now standing near to them,--almost so near that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
might hear their words. Burgo, perceiving this, walked up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>),
and, speaking in bad French, desired him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) to leave them. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you
see that I have a friend with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! a friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man answering</b></font>)</div>said the man, answering in bad English. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps de
friend can advance moneys?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) can do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo. <div class="bookquote">``You do as you are bid, and
leave me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the gentleman from the hotel retreated down the hill, but Mr.
Palliser, during the rest of the interview, frequently fancied that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) heard the man's footfall at no great distance.

<p/>They continued to walk on up the hill very slowly, and it was some
time before Mr. Palliser knew how to repeat his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) offer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So Lady Glencora is here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>Burgo said again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) is here. It was she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) who asked me to come to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Palliser answered. Then they both walked on a few steps in silence,
for neither of them knew how to address the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By George!--isn't it odd,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo, at last, <div class="bookquote">``that you and I, of
all men in the world, should be walking together here at Baden? It's
not only that you're the richest man in London, and that I'm the
poorest, but--; there are other things, you know, which make it so
funny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There have been things which make me and my wife very anxious to
give you aid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And have you considered, Mr. Palliser, that those things make you the
very man in the world,--indeed, for the matter of that, the only man
in the world,--from whom I can't take aid. I would have taken it all
if I could have got it,--and I tried hard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you have been disappointed, Mr. Fitzgerald.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Disappointed! By G--! yes. Did you ever know any man who had so
much right to be disappointed as I have? I did love her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), Mr. Palliser.
Nay, by heavens! I do love her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). Out here I will dare to say as much
even to you. I shall never try to see her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) again. All that is over, of
course. I've been a fool about her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) as I have been about everything.
But I did love her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe it, Mr. Fitzgerald.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not altogether her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) money. But think what it would have been
to me, Mr. Palliser. Think what a chance I had, and what a chance
I lost. I should have been at the top of everything,--as now I am
at the bottom. I should not have spent that. There would have been
enough of it to have saved me. And then I might have done something
good instead of crawling about almost in fear of that beast who is
watching us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been ordered otherwise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser, not knowing what
to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; it has been ordered, with a vengeance! It seems to have been
ordered that I'm to go to the devil; but I don't know who gave the
orders, and I don't know why.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Palliser had not time to explain to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) friend that the orders had
been given, in a very peremptory way, by himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was anxious
to bring back the conversation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) own point. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wished to give
some serviceable, and, if possible, permanent aid to the poor
ne'er-do-well; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) did not wish to talk more than could be helped
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) own wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is an old saying, which you will remember well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``that the way to good manners is never too late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo. <div class="bookquote">``It's too late when the man feels the
knot round his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck at the Old Bailey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not, even then. Indeed, we may say, certainly not, if the
man be still able to take the right way. But I don't want to preach
to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It wouldn't do any good, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do want to be of service to you. There is something of truth
in what you say. You have been disappointed; and I, perhaps, of all
men am the most bound to come to your assistance now that you are in
need.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I take it from you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgo/Burgo Fitzgerald/Fitzgerald</b></font>)</div>said Burgo, almost crying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall take it from her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--that would be worse; twenty times worse. What! take her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) money,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would not give me herself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not see why you should not borrow her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) money,--or mine. You
shall call it which you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I won't have it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what will you do then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What will I do? Ah! That's the question. I don't know what I will
do. I have the key of my bedroom in my pocket, and I will go to bed
to-night. It's not very often that I look forward much beyond that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you let me call on you, to-morrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see what good it will do? I shan't get up till late, for
fear they should shut the room against me. I might as well have as
much out of them as I can. I think I shall say I'm ill, and keep my

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what else I can offer?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can offer nothing. If you will say to your wife from me that
I bade her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) adieu;--that is all you can do for me. Good night, Mr.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``Good night, Mr. Palliser.'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/>Mr. Palliser left him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) and went his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) way, feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had no further
eloquence at his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) command. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) shook Burgo's hand, and then walked
quickly down the hill. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) did so he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) passed, or would have passed
the man who had been dodging them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Misther, Misther!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want of me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Palliser, in French.

<p/>Then the man spoke in French, also. <div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) got any money? Have you
given him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) any money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not given him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) any money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser, not quite knowing
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had better do or say under such circumstances.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) will have a bad time with it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man. <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) might

he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) got any friends, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) has friends. I do not know that I can assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), or you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! There are so many Fitzgeralds in England. Mr. Fitzgerald,

course. But; oh my G--! he (<font color='blue'><b>Baden</b></font>) might have carried away this night two

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you the hotelkeeper?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Baden</b></font>) friend, sir; only his (<font color='blue'><b>Baden</b></font>) friend. That is, I am the head
Commissionaire. I look after the gentlemen who sometimes are not
all--not all--''  (<font color='red'><b>the commissioner</b></font>)</div>exactly what they should be, the commissioner
intended to explain; and Mr. Palliser understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) although the
words were not quite spoken. The interview was ended by Mr. Palliser
taking the name of the hotel, and promising to call before Mr.
Fitzgerald should be up in the morning--a purposed visit, which we
need not regard as requiring any very early energy on Mr. Palliser's
part, when we remember Burgo's own programme for the following day.

<p/>Lady Glencora received her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband that night with infinite anxiety,
and was by no means satisfied with what had been done. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) described
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) as accurately as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could the nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) interview with
Burgo, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) described to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) also his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) other interview with the head
commissioner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Baden</b></font>) will; he (<font color='blue'><b>Baden</b></font>) will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
husband the man's surmise that perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might destroy himself.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Baden</b></font>) will; he (<font color='blue'><b>Baden</b></font>) will; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Baden</b></font>) does, how can you expect that I shall
bear it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>Mr. Palliser tried to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) by telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
promised visit to the landlord; and Lady Glencora, accepting this as
something, strove to instigate her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband to some lavish expenditure
on Burgo's behalf. <div class="bookquote">``There can be no reason why he (<font color='blue'><b>Baden</b></font>) should not take
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``None the least. Had it not been promised to him (<font color='blue'><b>Baden</b></font>)?
Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Baden</b></font>) not a right to it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>The subject was one which Mr. Palliser
found it very hard to discuss. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could not tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife that
Fitzgerald ought to accept his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) bounty; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>)
money should be forthcoming, almost to any extent, if it could be
made available.

<p/>On the following morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) went down to the hotel, and saw the
real landlord. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) to be a reasonable, tranquil, and very
good-natured man,--who was possessed by a not irrational desire that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) customers' bills should be paid; but who seemed to be much less
eager on the subject than are English landlords in general. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) chief
anxiety seemed to arise from the great difficulty of doing anything
with the gentleman who was now lying in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bed up-stairs. <div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Baden</b></font>)
had any breakfast?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>Mr. Palliser asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Breakfast! Oh yes;''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and the landlord laughed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had been very
particular in the orders he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had given. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had desired his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) cutlets to
be dressed in a particular way,--with a great deal of cayenne pepper,
and they had been so dressed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had ordered a bottle of Sauterne;
but the landlord had thought, or the head-waiter acting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had
thought, that a bottle of ordinary wine of the country would do as
well. The bottle of ordinary wine of the country had just that moment
been sent up-stairs.

<p/>Then Mr. Palliser sat down in the landlord's little room, and had
Burgo Fitzgerald's bill brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I think I might venture to
pay it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was as monsieur pleased,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the landlord, with something
like a sparkle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) eye.

<p/>What was Mr. Palliser to do? He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) did not know whether, in accordance
with the rules of the world in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) lived, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) ought to pay it,
or ought to leave it; and certainly the landlord could not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>).
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could not go back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife without
having done something; so, as a first measure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) paid the bill. The
landlord's eyes glittered, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) receipted it in the most becoming
manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Should he (<font color='blue'><b>Baden</b></font>) now send up the bottle of Sauterne?'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>--but to this Mr.
Palliser demurred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And to whom should the receipted bill be given?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>Mr. Palliser thought
that the landlord had better keep it himself for a while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps there is some little difficulty?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>suggested the landlord.

<p/>Mr. Palliser acknowledged that there was a little difficulty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) knew
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) must do something more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) could not simply pay the bill
and go away. That would not satisfy his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) must
do something more; but how was he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) to do it? So at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) let the
landlord into his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) confidence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) did not tell the whole of Burgo's
past history. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) did not tell that little episode in Burgo's life
which referred to Lady Glencora. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) did make the landlord
understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was willing to administer money to Mr. Fitzgerald,
if only it could only be administered judiciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Baden</b></font>) out of the gambling salon, you know, sir; that
is, not if he (<font color='blue'><b>Baden</b></font>) has a franc in his (<font color='blue'><b>Baden</b></font>) pocket.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>As to that the landlord was
very confident.

<p/>It was at last arranged, that the landlord was to tell Burgo that his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
bill did not signify at present, and that the use of the hotel was to
be at Burgo's command for the next three months. At the end of that
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was to have notice to quit. No money was to be advanced to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>);--but the landlord, even in this respect, had a discretion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I get home, I will see what can be done with his (<font color='blue'><b>Baden</b></font>) relations
there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) went home and told his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Baden</b></font>)'ll have no clothes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/>Mr. Palliser said that the judicious landlord would manage that also;
and in that way Lady Glencora was appeased,--appeased, till something
final could be done for the young man, on Mr. Palliser's return home.

<p/>Poor Burgo! He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) must now be made to end his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) career as far as these
pages are concerned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) soon found that something had been done for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) at the hotel, and no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) must have made some guess near
the truth. The discreet landlord told him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) nothing,--would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
nothing; but that his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) bill did not signify as yet. Burgo, thinking
about it, resolved to write about it in an indignant strain to Mr.
Palliser; but the letter did not get itself written. When in England,
Mr. Palliser saw Sir Cosmo Monk, and with many apologies, told him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I regret it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cosmo/Cosmo Monk</b></font>)</div>said Sir Cosmo, in anger. <div class="bookquote">``I regret it; not for the
money's sake, but I regret it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>The amount expended, was however
repaid to Mr. Palliser, and an arrangement was made for remitting
a weekly sum of fifteen pounds to Burgo, through a member of the
diplomatic corps, as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) should remain at a certain small
German town which was indicated, and in which there was no public
gambling-table. Lady Glencora expressed herself satisfied for the
present; but I must doubt whether poor Burgo lived long in comfort
on the allowance made to him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>).

<p/>Here we must say farewell to Burgo Fitzgerald.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXVII.

<p/>The Travellers Return Home.


<p/>Mr. Palliser did not remain long in Baden after the payment of
Burgo's bill. Perhaps I shall not throw any undeserved discredit
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) courage if I say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) was afraid to do so. What would he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
have said,--what would he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) have been able to say, if that young man
had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) demanding an explanation? So he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hurried away to
Strasbourg the same day, much to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife's satisfaction.

<p/>The journey home from thence was not marked by any incidents.
Gradually Mr. Palliser became a little more lenient to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife and
slightly less oppressive in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) caution. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) still inquired about
the springs of the carriages, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) did so in silence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) ceased to
enjoin the necessity of a day's rest after each day's journey. By
the time that they reached Dover he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had become so used to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife's
condition that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) made but little fluttering as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) walked out of
the boat by that narrow gangway which is so contrived as to make an
arrival there a serious inconvenience to a lady, and a nuisance even
to a man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was somewhat staggered when a big man, in the middle
of the night, insisted on opening the little basket which his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife
carried, and was uncomfortable when obliged to stop her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) on the plank
while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave up the tickets which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought had been already
surrendered; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was becoming used to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) position, and bore
himself like a man.

<p/>During their journey home Mr. Palliser had by no means kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) seat
opposite to Lady Glencora with constancy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had soon found that it
was easier to talk to Mr. Grey than to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) wife, and, consequently,
the two ladies had been much together, as had also the two gentlemen.
What the ladies discussed may be imagined. One was about to become
a wife and the other a mother, and that was to be their fate after
each had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind that no such lot was to be hers. It may,
however, be presumed that for every one word that Alice spoke Lady
Glencora spoke ten. The two men, throughout these days of close
intimacy, were intent upon politics. Mr. Palliser, who may be regarded
as the fox who had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) tail,--the tail being, in this instance,
the comfort of domestic privacy,--was eager in recommending his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) new
friend to cut off his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) tail also. <div class="bookquote">``Your argument would be very well,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``if men were to be contented to live for themselves only.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your argument would be very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other, <div class="bookquote">``if it were used
to a man who felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could do good to others by going into
public life. But it is wholly inefficacious if it recommends public
life simply or chiefly because a man may gratify his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own ambition by
public services.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course there is personal gratification, and of course there is
good done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is,--or should be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly; and the two things must go together. The chief
gratification comes from the feeling that you are of use.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you feel that you would not be of use?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>We need not follow the argument any further. We all know its nature,
and what between two such men would be said on both sides. We all
know that neither of them would put the matter altogether in a true
light. Men never can do so in words, let the light within themselves
be ever so clear. I do not think that any man yet ever had such a
gift of words as to make them a perfect exponent of all the wisdom
within him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But the effect was partly that which the weaker man of
the two desired,--the weaker in the gifts of nature, though art
had in some respects made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stronger. Mr. Grey was shaken in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
quiescent philosophy, and startled Alice,--startled her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
delighted her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),--by a word or two he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) said as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) walked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in the
courts of the Louvre. <div class="bookquote">``It's all hollow here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) said, speaking of
French politics.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very hollow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, who had no love for the French mode of
carrying on public affairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of all modes of governing this seems to me to be the surest of
coming to a downfall. Men are told that they are wise enough to talk,
but not wise enough to have any power of action. It is as though men
were cautioned that they were walking through gunpowder, and that
no fire could be allowed them, but were at the same time enjoined
to carry lucifer matches in their pockets. I don't believe in the
gunpowder, and I think there should be fire, and plenty of it; but if
I didn't want the fire I wouldn't have the matches.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's so odd to hear you talk politics,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, laughing.

<p/>After this he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) dropped the subject for a while, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) were
ashamed of it, but in a very few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) returned to it manfully.
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Palliser wants me to go into Parliament.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Upon hearing this Alice
said nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was afraid to speak. After all that had passed she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
felt that it would not become her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to show much outward joy on hearing
such a proposition, so spoken by him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could say nothing
without some sign of exultation in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) voice. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) walked on
without speaking, and was conscious that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) fingers trembled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
arm. <div class="bookquote">``What do you say about it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do I say? Oh, John, what right can I have to say anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one else can have so much right,--putting aside of course myself,
who must be responsible for my own actions. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) asked me whether I
could afford it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) seems to think that a smaller income suffices
for such work now than it did a few years since. I believe that I
could afford it, if I could get a seat that was not very expensive at
the first outset. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could help me there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On that point, of course, I can have no opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not on that point. I believe we may take that for granted.
Living in London for four or five months in the year might be
managed. But as to the mode of life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Alice was unable to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tongue longer, and spoke out her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
thoughts with more vehemence than discretion. No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) combated
them with some amount of opposition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) seldom allowed out-spoken
enthusiasm to pass by him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) without some amount of hostility. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
was not so perverse as to be driven from his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) new views by the fact
that Alice approved them, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) drew near home, was able
to think that the only flaw in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) character was in process of being
cured.

<p/>When they reached London they all separated. It was Mr. Palliser's
purpose to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife down to Matching with as little delay as
possible. London was at this time nearly empty, and all the doings
of the season were over. It was now the first week of August, and
as Parliament had not been sitting for nearly two months, the town
looked as it usually looks in September. Lady Glencora was to stay
but one day in Park Lane, and it had been understood between her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) and
Alice that they were not to see each other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How odd it is parting in this way, when people have been together so
long,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``It always seems as though there had been
a separate little life of its own which was now to be brought to a
close. I suppose, Mr. Grey, you and I, when we next meet, will be far
too distant to fight with each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope that may never be the case,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose nothing would prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) fighting; would it Alice? But,
remember, there must be no fighting when we do meet next, and that
must be in September.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grey. But Alice said nothing.

<p/>Then Mr. Palliser made his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) little speech. <div class="bookquote">``Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) gave
his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) hand to Miss Vavasor, <div class="bookquote">``give my compliments to your father, and
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that I shall take the liberty of asking him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to come down to
Matching for the early shooting in September, and that I shall expect
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to bring you with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). You may tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) also that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will have
to stay to see you off, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will not be allowed to take you
away.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora thought that this was very pretty as coming from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) on their way home.

<p/>Alice insisted on going to Queen Anne Street in a cab by herself.
Mr. Palliser had offered a carriage, and Mr. Grey, of course, offered
himself as a protector; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would have neither the one nor the
other. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had gone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) might by chance have met her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
father, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was most anxious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should not be encumbered
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) lover's presence when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) first received her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father's
congratulations. They had slept at Dover, and had come up by a
mid-day train. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) reached Queen Anne Street, the house was
desolate, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might therefore have allowed Mr. Grey to attend her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found a letter waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) for the moment
forget both him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father. Lady Macleod, at Cheltenham, was very
ill, and wished to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) niece, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) died. <div class="bookquote">``I
have got your letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>the kind woman</b></font>)</div>said the kind old woman, <div class="bookquote">``and am now quite
happy. It only wanted that to reconcile me to my departure. I thought
through it all that my girl would be happy at last. Will she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) forgive
me if I say that I have forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the kind woman</b></font>)</div>The letter then went on to beg
Alice to come to Cheltenham at once. <div class="bookquote">``It is not that I am dying now,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div>said Lady Macleod, <div class="bookquote">``though you will find me much altered and keeping
my bed. But the doctor says he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) fears the first cold weather. I know
what that means, my dear; and if I don't see you now, before your
marriage, I shall never see you again. Pray get married as soon as
you can. I want to know that you are Mrs. Grey before I go. If I were
to hear that it was postponed because of my illness, I think it would
kill me at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div><p/>There was another letter for her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) from Kate, full, of course, of
congratulations, and promising to be at the wedding; <div class="bookquote">``that is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said
Kate, <div class="bookquote">``unless it takes place at the house of some one of your very
grand friends;''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>and telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) that aunt Greenow was to be married
in a fortnight;--telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) of this, and begging her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) to attend that
wedding. <div class="bookquote">``You should stand by your family,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate. <div class="bookquote">``And only
think what my condition will be if I have no one here to support me.
Do come. Journeys are nothing nowadays. Don't you know I would go
seven times the distance for you? Mr. Cheesacre and Captain Bellfield
are friends after all, and Mr. Cheesacre is to be best man. Is it
not beautiful? As for poor me, I'm told I haven't a chance left of
becoming mistress of Oileymead and all its wealth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice began to think that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hands were almost too full. If
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) herself were to be married in September, even by the end of
September, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hands were very full indeed. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not know how
to refuse any of the requests made to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). As to Lady Macleod, her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>)
visit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) was a duty which must of course be performed at once.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) would stay but one day in London, and then go down to Cheltenham.
Having resolved upon this she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) at once wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) aunt to that
effect. As to that other affair down in Westmoreland, she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) sighed
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) thought of it, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) feared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) must go there also.
Kate had suffered too much on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) behalf to allow of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) feeling
indifferent to such a request.

<p/>Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) father came in. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't in the least know when you might
arrive,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), beginning with an apology for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) absence. <div class="bookquote">``How
could I, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice scorned to remind him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) herself had
named the precise hour of the train by which they had arrived. <div class="bookquote">``It's
all right, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I was very glad to have an hour to write
a letter or two. Poor Lady Macleod is very ill. I must go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) the
day after to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear, dear! I had heard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) was poorly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) is very old,
you know. So, Alice, you've made it all square with Mr. Grey at last?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, papa;--if you call that square.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; I do call it square. It has all come round to the proper
thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) thinks so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think yourself, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've no doubt it's the proper thing for me, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not; of course not; and I can tell you this, Alice, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is
a man in a thousand. You've heard about the money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What money, papa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The money that George had.''  (<font color='red'><b>the reader</b></font>)</div>As the reader is aware, Alice had heard
nothing special about this money. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) only knew, or supposed she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
knew, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had given three thousand pounds to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin. But now
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) the whole transaction. <div class="bookquote">``We couldn't have
realized your money for months, perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but Grey knew
that some men must have rope enough before they can hang themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice was unable to say anything on this subject to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father, but
to herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did declare that not in that way or with that hope
had John Grey produced his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) money. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) must be paid, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Paid!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) answered; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) can pay himself now. It may make some
difference in the settlements, perhaps, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) and the lawyers may
arrange that. I shan't think of interfering with such a man as Grey.
If you could only know, my dear, what I've suffered!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Alice in a
penitential tone expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sorrow, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) too assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Bless you, my child!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and make
you happy, and good, and--and--and very comfortable.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>After that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) club.

<p/>Alice made her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) journey down to Cheltenham without any adventure, and
was received by Lady Macleod with open arms. <div class="bookquote">``Dearest Alice, it is so
good of you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, <div class="bookquote">``would I not have gone a thousand
miles to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Macleod was very eager to know all about the coming marriage.
<div class="bookquote">``I can tell you now, my dear, though I couldn't do it before, that
I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)'d persist for ever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) told me so himself in confidence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) has persisted, aunt; that is certain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I hope you'll reward him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>). A beautiful woman without discretion
is like a pearl in a swine's snout; but a good wife is a crown of
glory to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband. Remember that, my dear, and choose your part
for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't be that unfortunate pearl, if I can help it, aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We can all help it, if we set about it in the right way. And Alice,
you must be careful to find out all his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) likes and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dislikes. Dear
me! I remember how hard I found it, but then I don't think I was so
clever as you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes I think nobody has ever been so stupid as I have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not stupid, my dear; if I must say the word, it is self-willed. But,
dear, all that is forgiven now. Is it not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a forgiveness which it is rather hard to get,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/>There was something said then as to the necessity of looking for
pardon beyond this world, which I need not here repeat. To all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
old friend's little sermons Alice was infinitely more attentive than
had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wont, so that Lady Macleod was comforted and took heart
of grace, and at last brought forth from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) pillow a letter
from the Countess of Midlothian, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) had received a day or
two since, and which bore upon Alice's case. <div class="bookquote">``I was not quite sure
whether I'd show it you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div>said Lady Macleod, <div class="bookquote">``because you wouldn't
answer her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wrote to you. But when I'm gone, as I shall be
soon, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) will be the nearest relative you have on your mother's
side, and from her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) great position, you know, Alice--''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div>But here Alice
became impatient for the letter. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) aunt handed it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
read as follows:--


<p/>Castle Reekie, July, 186--.

<p/>DEAR LADY MACLEOD,--

<p/>I am sorry to hear of the symptoms you speak about. I
strongly advise you to depend chiefly on beef-tea. They
should be very careful to send it up quite free from
grease, and it should not be too strong of the meat. There
should be no vegetables in it. Not soup, you know, but
beef-tea. If any thing acts upon your strength, that will.
I need not tell one who has lived as you have done where
to look for that other strength which alone can support
you at such a time as this. I would go to you if I thought
that my presence would be any comfort to you, but I know
how sensitive you are, and the shock might be too much for
you.

<p/>If you see Alice Vavasor on her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) return to England, as you
probably will, pray tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) from me that I give her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) my
warmest congratulations, and that I am heartily glad that
matters are arranged. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) treated my attempts to
heal the wound in a manner that they did not deserve; but
all that shall be forgiven, as shall also her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) original bad
behaviour to poor Mr. Grey.


<p/>Alice was becoming weary of so much forgiveness, and told herself,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was reading the letter, that that of Lady Midlothian was at
any rate unnecessary. <div class="bookquote">``I trust that we may yet meet and be friends,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>continued Lady Midlothian. <div class="bookquote">``I am extremely gratified at finding that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) has been thought so much of by Mr. Palliser. I'm told that Mr.
Palliser and Mr. Grey have become great friends, and if this is so,
Alice must be happy to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) has had it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) power to
confer so great a benefit on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) future husband as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will receive
from this introduction.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I ain't a bit happy, and I have conferred
no benefit on Mr. Grey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Alice, who was unable to repress
the anger occasioned by the last paragraph.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is a great benefit, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Palliser has every bit as much cause to be gratified for that as
Mr. Grey, and perhaps more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Lady Macleod could not argue the matter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) present state.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) merely sighed, and moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) shrivelled old hand up and down upon
the counterpane. Alice finished the letter without further remarks.
It merely went on to say how happy the writer would be to know
something of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin as Mrs. Grey, as also to know something of Mr.
Grey, and then gave a general invitation to both Mr. and Mrs. Grey,
asking them to come to Castle Reekie whenever they might be able. The
Marchioness, with whom Lady Midlothian was staying, had expressly
desired her (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) to give this message. Alice, however, could not but
observe that Lady Midlothian's invitation applied only to another
person's house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) means well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div>said Lady Macleod, <div class="bookquote">``and then you know you'll
probably have children; and think what a thing it will be for them to
know the Midlothian family. You shouldn't rob them of their natural
advantages.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Macleod/Macleod/LADY MACLEOD</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice remained a week with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) aunt, and went from thence direct to
Westmoreland. Some order as to bridal preparations we must presume
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) gave on that single day which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) passed in London. Much
advice she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had received on this head from Lady Glencora, and no
inconsiderable amount of assistance was to be rendered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) at
Matching during the fortnight she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would remain there before her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
marriage. Something also, let us hope, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) might do at Cheltenham.
Something no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) did do. Something also might probably be
achieved among the wilds in Westmoreland, but that something would
necessarily be of a nature not requiring fashionable tradespeople.
While at Cheltenham, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would not again return
to London before her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) marriage. This resolve was caused by a very
urgent letter from Mr. Grey, and by another, almost equally urgent,
from Lady Glencora. If the marriage did not take place in September
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) would not be present at it. The gods of the world,--of Lady
Glencora's world,--had met together and come to a great decision.
Lady Glencora was to be removed in October to Gatherum Castle, and
remain there till the following spring, so that the heir might,
in truth, be born in the purple. <div class="bookquote">``It is such a bore,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady
Glencora, <div class="bookquote">``and I know it will be a girl. But the Duke isn't to be
there, except for the Christmas week.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>An invitation for the ceremony
at Matching had been sent from Mr. Palliser to Mr. Vavasor, and another
from Lady Glencora to Kate, <div class="bookquote">``whom I long to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) ladyship,
<div class="bookquote">``and with whom I should like to pick a crow, if I dared, as I'm sure
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did all the mischief.''




 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXXVIII.

<p/>Mr. Cheesacre's Fate.


<p/>It must be acknowledged that Mrs. Greenow was a woman of great
resources, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) would be very prudent for others, though I
fear the verdict of those who know her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) must go against her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) in regard
to prudence in herself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) marriage with Captain Bellfield was a
rash act,--certainly a rash act, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) did take so much care
in securing the payment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) own income into her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) own hands; but the
manner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) live discreetly for some months previous
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) marriage, the tact with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) renewed the friendship which
had existed between him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) and Mr. Cheesacre, and the skill she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) used in
at last providing Mr. Cheesacre with a wife, oblige us all to admit
that, as a general, she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had great powers.

<p/>When Alice reached Vavasor Hall she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found Charlie Fairstairs
established there on a long visit. Charlie and Kate were to be
the two bridesmaids, and, as Kate told her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cousin in their first
confidential intercourse on the evening of Alice's arrival, there
were already great hopes in the household that the master of
Oileymead might be brought to surrender. It was true that Charlie had
not a shilling, and that Mr. Cheesacre had set his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) heart on marrying
an heiress. It was true that Miss Fairstairs had always stood low in
the gentleman's estimation, as being connected with people who were
as much without rank and fashion as they were without money, and that
the gentleman loved rank and fashion dearly. It was true that Charlie
was no beauty, and that Cheesacre had an eye for feminine charms. It
was true that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had despised Charlie, and had spoken his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) contempt
openly;--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) had seen the girl on the sands at Yarmouth every
summer for the last ten years, and about the streets of Norwich every
winter, and had learned to regard her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as a thing poor and despicable,
because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was common in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) eyes. It is thus that the Cheesacres
judge of people. But in spite of all these difficulties Mrs. Greenow
had taken up poor Charlie's case, and Kate Vavasor expressed a strong
opinion that her (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) aunt would win.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What has she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) done to the man?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Coaxed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); simply that. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has made herself so much his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doesn't know how to say no to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Sometimes I have thought
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might possibly run away, but I have abandoned that fear now.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has little confidences with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from day to day, which are so
alluring to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot tear himself off. In the middle of one
of them he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will find himself engaged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, the unfortunate girl! Won't it be a wretched marriage for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a very good wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s one of those men
to whom any woman, after a little time, will come to be the same.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll be rough with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) once a month or so, and perhaps tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brought no money with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); but that won't break any bones,
and Charlie will know how to fight her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own battles. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll save his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
money if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brings none, and in a few years' time they will quite
understand each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Cheesacre and Captain Bellfield were at this time living in
lodgings together, at Penrith, but came over and spent every other
day at Vavasor, returning always to their lodgings in the evening.
It wanted but eight days to the marriage when Alice arrived, and
preparations for that event were in progress. <div class="bookquote">``It's to be very quiet,
Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) aunt; <div class="bookquote">``as quiet as such a thing can be made. I owe
that to the memory of the departed one. I know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) is looking
down upon me, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) approves all that I do. Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) told
me once that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) did not want me to live desolate for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) sake. If I
didn't feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was looking down and approving it, I should be
wretched indeed.''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) took Alice up to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) trousseau, and gave
the other expectant bride some little hints which, under present
circumstances, might be useful. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed; only three-and-sixpence
a piece, and they're quite real. Feel them. You wouldn't get them in
the shops under six.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice did feel them, and wondered whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
aunt could have saved the half-crown honestly. <div class="bookquote">``I had my eyes about
me when I was up in town, my dear. And look here, these are quite
new,--have never been on yet, and I had them when I was married
before. There is nothing like being careful, my dear. I hate
meanness, as everybody knows who knows me; but there is nothing like
being careful. You have a lot of rich people about you just now, and
will have ever so many things given you which you won't want. Do
you put them all by, and be careful. They may turn out useful, you
know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>Saying this, Mrs. Greenow folded up, among her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) present bridal
belongings, sundries of the wealth which had accrued to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) in an
earlier stage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) career.

<p/>And then Mrs. Greenow opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) mind to Alice about the Captain.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s as good as gold, my dear; he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is, indeed,--in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) own way. Of
course, I know that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has faults, and I should like to know who
hasn't. Although poor dear Greenow certainly was more without them
than anybody else I ever knew.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>As this remembrance came upon Mrs.
Greenow she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) handkerchief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) eyes, and Alice observed
that that which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) held still bore the deepest hem of widowhood.
They would be used, no doubt, till the last day, and then put by in
lavender for future possible occasions. <div class="bookquote">``Bellfield may have been a
little extravagant. I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has. But how can a man help being
extravagant when he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hasn't got any regular income? He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has been
ill-treated in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) profession; very. It makes my blood curdle when I
think of it. After fighting his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) country's battles through blood, and
dust, and wounds;--but I'll tell you about that another time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose a man seldom does make a fortune, aunt, by being a
soldier?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, my dear; much better be a tailor. Don't you ever marry a
soldier. But as I was saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) is the best-tempered creature
alive, and the staunchest friend I ever met. You should hear what Mr.
Cheesacre says of him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)! But you don't know Mr. Cheesacre?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, aunt, not yet. If you remember, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) went away before I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) came here before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know, poor fellow! Between you and me, Kate might have had
him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) liked; but perhaps Kate was right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would have suited Kate at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because of the farmyard, you mean? Kate shouldn't give herself airs.
Money's never dirty, you know. But perhaps it's all for the best.
There's a sweet girl here to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is violently attached, and who I
hope will become Mrs. Cheesacre. But as I was saying, the friendship
between these two men is quite wonderful, and I have always observed
that when a man can create that kind of affection in the bosom of
another man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) invariably is,--the sort of man,--the man, in fact,
who makes a good husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice knew the story of Charlie Fairstairs and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hopes; knew of
the quarrels between Bellfield and Cheesacre; knew almost as much of
Bellfield's past life as Mrs. Greenow did herself; and Mrs. Greenow
was no doubt aware that such was the case. Nevertheless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had a
pleasure in telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) own story, and told it as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) believed
every word that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) spoke.

<p/>On the following day the two gentlemen came over, according to
custom, and Alice observed that Miss Fairstairs hardly spoke to Mr.
Cheesacre. Indeed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) manner of avoiding that gentleman was so very
marked, that it was impossible not to observe it. They drank tea out
of doors, and when Mr. Cheesacre on one occasion sauntered across
towards the end of the bench on which Charlie was sitting, Charlie
got up and walked away. And in strolling about the place afterwards,
and in going up through the wood, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was at great pains to attach
herself to some other person, so that there should be no such
attaching between her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) and the owner of Oileymead. At one time Mr.
Cheesacre did get close up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) and spoke some word, some very
indifferent word. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was being cut and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) wanted to
avoid the appearance of a scene. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie/Charlie Fairstairs</b></font>)</div>said Charlie,
again moving away with excellent dignity, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) at once attached
herself to Alice who was close by. <div class="bookquote">``I know you have just come home
from Switzerland,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie/Charlie Fairstairs</b></font>)</div>said Charlie. <div class="bookquote">``Beautiful Switzerland! My heart
pants for Switzerland. Do tell me something about Switzerland!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Cheesacre had heard that Alice was the dear friend of a lady who
would probably some day become a duchess. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) therefore naturally
held her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in awe, and slunk away. On this occasion Mrs. Greenow clung
lovingly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) future husband, and the effect was that Mr. Cheesacre
found himself to be very much alone and unhappy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had generally
enjoyed these days at Vavasor Hall, having found himself, or fancied
himself, to be the dominant spirit there. That Mrs. Greenow was always
in truth the dominant spirit I need hardly say; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) knew how to
make a companion happy, and well also how to make him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) wretched. On
the whole of this day poor Cheesacre was very wretched.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I shall go there any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) said to Bellfield, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) drove the gig back to Penrith that evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not go there any more, Cheesy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div>said Bellfield; <div class="bookquote">``why, we are to have
the dinner out in the field on Friday. It's your own bespeak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bellfield/Mrs. Bellfield</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes; I'll go on Friday, but not after that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll stop and see me turned off, old fellow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the use? You'll get your wife, and that's enough for you. The
truth is, that since that girl came down from London with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) d--d
airs;'' (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>--the girl from London with the airs was poor Alice,--<div class="bookquote">``the
place is quite changed. I'm blessed if the whole thing isn't as dark
as ditch-water. I'm a plain man, I am; and I do hate your swells.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Against this view of the case Captain Bellfield argued stoutly; but
Cheesacre had been offended, and throughout the next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was cross
and touchy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) wouldn't play billiards, and on one occasion hinted
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) should get that money soon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You did it admirably, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow that night
to Charlie Fairstairs. The widow was now on terms almost more
confidential with Miss Fairstairs than with her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) own niece, Kate
Vavasor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) loved a little bit of intrigue; and though Kate could
intrigue, as we have seen in this story, Kate would not join her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
aunt's intrigues. <div class="bookquote">``You did it admirably. I really did not think you
had so much in you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie/Charlie Fairstairs</b></font>)</div>said Charlie, blushing at the praise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And it's the only way, my dear;--the only way, I mean, for you with
such a one as him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). And if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does come round, you'll find him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an
excellent husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cares for me a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie/Charlie Fairstairs</b></font>)</div>said Charlie whimpering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh, nonsense! Girls never know whether men care for them or not.
If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asks you to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), won't that be a sign that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cares for
you? and if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) don't, why, there'll be no harm done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thinks it's his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money--''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie/Charlie Fairstairs</b></font>)</div>began Charlie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, don't talk nonsense, Charlie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow, <div class="bookquote">``or you'll
make me sick. Of course it's his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) money, more or less. You don't
mean to tell me you'd go and fall in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was like
Bellfield, and hadn't got a rap? I can afford that sort of thing; you
can't. I don't mean to say you ain't to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>). Of course, you're
to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>); and I've no doubt you will, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) a very good
wife. I always think that worldliness and sentimentality are like
brandy-and-water. I don't like either of them separately, but taken
together they make a very nice drink. I like them warm, with -- as
the gentlemen say.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>To this little lecture Miss Fairstairs listened
with dutiful patience, and when it was over she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) said nothing more
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) outraged affections or of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) disregard for money. <div class="bookquote">``And
now, my dear, mind you look your best on Friday. I'll get him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) away
immediately after dinner, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)'s done with me you can contrive
to be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) way, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/>The next day was what Kate called the blank day at the Hall. The
ladies were all alone, and devoted themselves, as was always the case
on the blank days, to millinery and household cares. Mrs. Greenow,
as has before been stated, had taken a lease of the place, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
troubles extended beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) mere bridal wardrobe. Large trunks of
household linen had arrived, and all this linen was marked with the
name of Greenow; Greenow, 5.58; Greenow, 7.52; and a good deal had
to be done before this ancient wealth of housewifery could probably
be converted to Bellfield purposes. <div class="bookquote">``We must cut out the pieces,
Jeannette, and work 'em in again ever so carefully,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow,
after some painful consideration. <div class="bookquote">``It will always show,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeannette</b></font>)</div>said
Jeannette, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``But the other would show worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said
the widow; <div class="bookquote">``and if you finedraw it, not one person in ten will notice
it. We'd always put them on with the name to the feet, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not quite true that Cheesacre had bespoke the dinner out in
the field, although no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had done so. The little
treat, if treat it was, had all been arranged by Mrs. Greenow, who
was ever ready to create festivities. There was not much scope for
a picnic here. Besides their own party, which, of course, included
the Captain and Mr. Cheesacre, no guest could be caught except the
clergyman;--that low-church clergyman, who was so anxious about his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
income, and with whom the old Squire had quarrelled. Mrs. Greenow
had quickly obtained the advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) alliance, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), who was
soon to perform on her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) behalf the marriage ceremony, had promised
to grace this little festival. The affair simply amounted to this,
that they were to eat their dinner uncomfortably in the field
instead of comfortably in the dining-room. But Mrs. Greenow knew that
Charlie's charms would be much strengthened by a dinner out-of-doors.
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) said to Kate, <div class="bookquote">``nothing makes a man come forward so
well as putting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) altogether out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) usual tack. A man who
wouldn't think of such a thing in the drawing-room would be sure to
make an offer if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spent an evening with a young lady down-stairs in
the kitchen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/>At two o'clock the gig from Penrith arrived at the Hall, and for
the next hour both Cheesacre and the Captain were engaged in
preparing the tables and carrying out the viands. The Captain and
Charlie Fairstairs were going to lay the cloth. <div class="bookquote">``Let me do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said
Cheesacre taking it out of the Captain's hands. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said
the Captain, giving up his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) prize. <div class="bookquote">``Captain Bellfield would do it much
better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie/Charlie Fairstairs</b></font>)</div>said Charlie, with a little toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) head; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)'s as good
as a married man, and they always do these things best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlie/Charlie Fairstairs</b></font>)</div><p/>The day was fine, and although the shade was not perfect, and the
midges were troublesome, the dinner went off very nicely. It was
beautiful to see how well Mrs. Greenow remembered herself about the
grace, seeing that the clergyman was there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was just in time, and
would have been very angry with herself, and have thought herself
awkward, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) forgotten it. Mr. Cheesacre sat on her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) right hand,
and the clergyman on her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) left, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) hardly spoke a word to
Bellfield. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) sweetest smiles were all given to Cheesacre. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was
specially anxious to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) neighbour, the parson, in good-humour,
and therefore illuminated him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) once in every five minutes with a
passing ray, but the full splendour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) light was poured out upon
Cheesacre, as it never had before been poured. How she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) did flatter
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), and with what a capacious gullet did he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) swallow her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) flatteries!
Oileymead was the only paradise she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) had ever seen. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, me; when I
think of it sometimes,--but never mind.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>A moment came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
thought that even yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) might win the race, and send Bellfield away
howling into outer darkness. A moment came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>), and the widow saw
the moment well. <div class="bookquote">``I know I have done for the best,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and
therefore I shall never regret it; at any rate, it's done now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not done yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) plaintively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; done, and done, and done. Besides, a man in your position in
the county should always marry a wife younger than yourself,--a good
deal younger.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>Cheesacre did not understand the argument, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>)
liked the allusion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) position in the county, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) perceived
that it was too late for any changes in the present arrangements. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was happy; and all that feeling of animosity to Alice had vanished
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) breast. Poor Alice! she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), at any rate, was innocent. With so
much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own to fill her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been but little able to
take her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) share in the Greenow festivities; and we may safely say,
that if Mr. Cheesacre's supremacy was on any occasion attacked, it
was not attacked by her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) supremacy on this occasion was paramount,
and during the dinner, and after the dinner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was allowed to
give his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) orders to Bellfield in a manner that must have gratified
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) much. <div class="bookquote">``You must have another glass of champagne with me, my
friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow; and Mr. Cheesacre drank the other glass of
champagne. It was not the second nor the third that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had taken.

<p/>After dinner they started off for a ramble through the fields, and
Mrs. Greenow and Mr. Cheesacre were together. I think that Charlie
Fairstairs did not go with them at all. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) went into the
house and washed her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) face, and brushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) hair, and settled her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
muslin. I should not wonder if she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) frock and ironed it
again. Captain Bellfield, I know, went with Alice, and created some
astonishment by assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) fully meant to correct the error
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) ways. <div class="bookquote">``I know what it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``to be connected with such
a family as yours, Miss Vavasor.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) too had heard about the future
duchess, and wished to be on his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) best behaviour. Kate fell to the lot
of the parson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the last time we shall ever be together in this way,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said
the widow to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre; <div class="bookquote">``I hope not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The last time. On Wednesday I become Mrs. Bellfield, and I need
hardly say that I have many things to think of before that; but Mr.
Cheesacre, I hope we are not to be strangers hereafter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>Mr. Cheesacre
said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) hoped not. Oileymead would always be open to Captain and
Mrs. Bellfield.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We all know your hospitality,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellfield</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``it is not to-day nor
to-morrow that I or my husband,--that is to be,--will have to learn
that. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) always declares that you are the very beau ideal of an
English country gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Merely a poor Norfolk farmer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre. <div class="bookquote">``I never want to
put myself beyond my own place. There has been some talk about the
Commission of the Peace, but I don't think anything of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been the greatest blessing in the world for him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) has
ever known you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow, still talking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) future
husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've tried to be good-natured; that's all. D-- me, Mrs. Greenow,
what's the use of living if one doesn't try to be good-natured? There
isn't a better fellow than Bellfield living. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) and I ran for the
same plate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has won it. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s a lucky fellow, and I don't
begrudge him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) luck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's so manly of you, Mr. Cheesacre! But, indeed, the plate you
speak of was not worth your running for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I may have my own opinion about that, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not. Nobody knows that as well as I do, or could have thought

that has passed, do you think that I could be a visitor at your house
unless there is a mistress there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, I think you might.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Mr. Cheesacre; certainly not. For all our sakes, I should
decline. But if you were married--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are always wanting to marry me, Mrs. Greenow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do, I do. It is the only way in which there can be any friendship
between us, and not for worlds would I lose that advantage for my
husband,--let alone what I may feel for myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you take me yourself, Mrs. Greenow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you can't understand, it is not for me to say anything more, Mr.
Cheesacre. If you value the warm affection of a virgin heart--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Mrs. Greenow, all yesterday she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) wouldn't say a word to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not say a word to you? Is that all you know about it? Are you so
ignorant that you cannot see when a girl's heart is breaking beneath
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stays?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>This almost improper allusion had quite an effect on Mr.
Cheesacre's sensitive bosom. <div class="bookquote">``Did you say a word to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) yesterday?
And if not, why have you said so many words before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mrs. Greenow; come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is, oh, Mrs. Greenow. But it is time that we should go back
to them.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They had been sitting all this time on a bank, under a
hedge. <div class="bookquote">``We will have our tea, and you shall have your pipe and
brandy-and-water, and Charlie shall bring it to you. Shall she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), Mr.
Cheesacre?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) likes she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) shall, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)'ll like it it quick enough. But remember,
Mr. Cheesacre, I'm quite serious in what I say about your having a
mistress for your house. Only think what an age you'll be when your
children grow up, if you don't marry soon now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlie/Charlie Fairstairs</b></font>)</div><p/>They returned to the field in which they had dined, and found Charlie
under the trees, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) muslin looking very fresh. <div class="bookquote">``What, all
a-mort?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow. Charlie did not quite understand this, but
replied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) preferred being alone. <div class="bookquote">``I have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) that you
should fill his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) pipe for him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) doesn't care for
ladies to fill his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) pipe for him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie/Charlie Fairstairs</b></font>)</div>said Charlie. <div class="bookquote">``Do you try,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said
the widow, <div class="bookquote">``while I go indoors and order the tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div><p/>It had been necessary to put the bait very close before Cheesacre's
eyes, or there would have been no hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) might take it. The
bait had been put so very close that we must feel sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) saw
the hook. But there are fish so silly that they will take the bait
although they know the hook is there. Cheesacre understood it all.
Many things he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) could not see, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) could see that Mrs. Greenow
was trying to catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) as a husband for Charlie Fairstairs; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fairstairs</b></font>)
knew also that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fairstairs</b></font>) had always despised Charlie, and that no worldly
advantage whatever would accrue to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) by a marriage with such a
girl. But there she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) didn't quite know how to avoid it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did look rather nice in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) clear-starched muslin frock, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) should like to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) needn't marry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). The champagne which had created the desire also gave
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) the audacity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) gave one glance around him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) to see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was
not observed, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) did kiss Charlie Fairstairs under the
trees. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Cheesacre,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie/Charlie Fairstairs</b></font>)</div>said Charlie. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Cheesacre,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>echoed
a laughing voice; and poor Cheesacre, looking round, saw that Mrs.
Greenow, who ought to have been inside the house looking after the
boiling water, was moving about for some unknown reason within sight
of the spot which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) had chosen for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) dalliance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Cheesacre,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie/Charlie Fairstairs</b></font>)</div>said Charlie sobbing, <div class="bookquote">``how dare you do that?--and
where all the world could see you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlie/Charlie Fairstairs</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was only Mrs. Greenow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>said Cheesacre.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what will she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) think of me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord bless you--she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) won't think anything about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do;--I think a great deal about it. I don't know what to do,
I don't;--I don't.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie/Charlie Fairstairs</b></font>)</div>Whereupon Charlie got up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) seat under the
trees and began to move away slowly. Cheesacre thought about it for
a moment or two. Should he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) or should he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) not? He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) knew that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had better not follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was bait with a very
visible hook. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was a big fish for whom these two women
were angling. But after all, perhaps it wouldn't do him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) much harm to
be caught. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) got up and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>). I don't suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) meant
to take the way towards the woods,--towards the little path leading
to the old summer-house up in the trees. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was too much beside
herself to know where she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was going, no doubt. But that was the
path she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) did take, and before long she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) and Cheesacre were in the
summerhouse together. <div class="bookquote">``Don't, Sam, don't! Somebody really will be
coming. Well, then, there. Now I won't do it again.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Twas thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
spoke when the last kiss was given on this occasion;--unless there
may have been one or two later in the evening, to which it is not
necessary more especially to allude here. But on the occasion of that
last kiss in the summer-house Miss Fairstairs was perfectly justified
by circumstances, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was then the promised bride of Mr.
Cheesacre.

<p/>But how was he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) to get down again among his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) friends? That
consideration troubled Mr. Cheesacre as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) happy seat
after that last embrace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had promised Charlie, and perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
would keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) promise, but it might be as well not to make it all
too public at once. But Charlie wasn't going to be thrown over;--not
if she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) knew it, as she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) said to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) returned therefore
triumphantly among them all,--blushing indeed, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) eyes
turned away, and her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) hand now remained upon her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) lover's arm;--but
still so close to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) that there could be no mistake. <div class="bookquote">``Goodness,
gracious, Charlie! where have you and Mr. Cheesacre been?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Greenow. <div class="bookquote">``We got up into the woods and lost ourselves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie/Charlie Fairstairs</b></font>)</div>said Charlie.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow.

<p/>It would be too long to tell now, in these last pages of our story,
how Cheesacre strove to escape, and with what skill Mrs. Greenow kept
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) bargain. I hope that Charlie Fairstairs was duly grateful.
Before that evening was over, under the comfortable influence of
a glass of hot brandy-and-water,--the widow had, I think, herself
mixed the second glass for Mr. Cheesacre, before the influence became
sufficiently comfortable,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) was forced to own that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) had made
himself the happy possessor of Charlie Fairstairs' heart and hand.
<div class="bookquote">``And you are a lucky man,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow with enthusiasm; <div class="bookquote">``and I
congratulate you with all my heart. Don't let there be any delay now,
because a good thing can't be done too soon.''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>And indeed, before
that night was over, Mrs. Greenow had the pair together in her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) own
presence, and then fixed the day. <div class="bookquote">``A fellow ought to be allowed to
turn himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cheesacre/Cheesacre</b></font>)</div>Cheesacre said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>), pleading for himself in a
whisper. But no; Mrs. Greenow would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheesacre</b></font>) no such mercy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) knew
to what a man turning himself might probably lead. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) was a woman
who was quite in earnest when she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>) went to work, and I hope that
Miss Fairstairs was grateful. Then, in that presence, was in truth
the last kiss given on that eventful evening. <div class="bookquote">``Come, Charlie, be
good-natured to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)'s as good as your own now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow.
And Charlie was good-natured. <div class="bookquote">``It's to be as soon as ever we come
back from our trip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Greenow/Greenow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Greenow to Kate, the next day, <div class="bookquote">``and
I'm lending her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) money to get all her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) things at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) shall come to
the scratch, though I go all the way to Norfolk by myself and fetch
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) ears. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) shall come, as sure as my name's Greenow,--or
Bellfield, as it will be then, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I shouldn't wonder if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) did have to go to Norfolk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>said Kate
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cousin. That event, however, cannot be absolutely concluded in
these pages. I can only say that, when I think of Mrs. Greenow's force
of character and warmth of friendship, I feel that Miss Fairstairs'
prospects stand on good ground.

<p/>Mrs. Greenow's own marriage was completed with perfect success. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenow</b></font>)
took Captain Bellfield for better or for worse, with a thorough
determination to make the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) worst, and to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
legs, if any such putting might be possible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), at any rate, had
been in luck. If any possible stroke of fortune could do him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) good, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
had found that stroke. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had found a wife who could forgive all his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
past offences,--and also, if necessary, some future offences; who
had money enough for all his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) wants, and kindness enough to gratify
them, and who had, moreover,--which for the Captain was the most
important,--strength enough to keep from him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) the power of ruining
them both. Reader, let us wish a happy married life to Captain and
Mrs. Bellfield!

<p/>The day after the ceremony Alice Vavasor and Kate Vavasor started for
Matching Priory.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXIX.

<p/>Diamonds Are Diamonds.


<p/>Kate and Alice, as they drew near to their journey's end, were both
a little flurried, and I cannot but own that there was cause for
nervousness. Kate Vavasor was to meet Mr. Grey for the first time. Mr.
Grey was now staying at Matching and was to remain there until a week
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) marriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) was then to return to Cambridgeshire for a day
or two, and after that was to become a guest at the rector's house
at Matching the evening before the ceremony. <div class="bookquote">``Why not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) come
here at once?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband. <div class="bookquote">``It is such
nonsense, you know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>But Mr. Palliser would not hear of it. Mr.
Palliser, though a Radical in public life, would not for worlds
transgress the social laws of his (<font color='blue'><b>Radical</b></font>) ancestors; and so the matter was
settled. Kate on this very day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) arrival at Matching would thus
see Mr. Grey for the first time, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) could not but feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
had been the means of doing Mr. Grey much injury. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had moreover
something,--not much indeed, but still something,--of that feeling
which made the Pallisers terrible to the imagination, because of
their rank and wealth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was a little afraid of the Pallisers, but
of Mr. Grey she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was very much afraid. And Alice also was not at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
ease. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would fain have prevented so very quick a marriage had she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
not felt that now,--after all the trouble that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had caused,--there
was nothing left for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) but to do as others wished. When a day
had been named she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had hardly dared to demur, and had allowed Lady
Glencora to settle everything as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had wished. But it was not
only the suddenness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) marriage which dismayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>). Its nature
and attributes were terrible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>). Both Lady Midlothian and the
Marchioness of Auld Reekie were coming. When this was told to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) by
letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had no means of escape. <div class="bookquote">``Lady Macleod is right in nearly
all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) says,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora had written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``At any rate,
you needn't be such a fool as to run away from your cousins, simply
because they have handles to their names. You must take the thing
as it comes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora, moreover, had settled for her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) the list
of bridesmaids. Alice had made a petition that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might be allowed
to go through the ceremony with only one,--with none but Kate to
back her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) ought to have known that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) consented to be
married at Matching,--and indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had had very little power of
resisting that proposition,--all such questions would be decided for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). Two daughters therefore of Lady Midlothian were to act, Lady
Jane and Lady Mary, and the one daughter of the Marchioness, who was
also a Lady Jane, and there were to be two Miss Howards down from
London,--girls who were known both to Alice and to Lady Glencora,
and who were in some distant way connected with them both. A great
attempt was made to induce the two Miss Pallisers to join the bevy,
but they had frankly pleaded their age. <div class="bookquote">``No woman should stand up as
a bridesmaid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophy</b></font>)</div>said the strong-minded Sophy, <div class="bookquote">``who doesn't mean to get
married if she (<font color='blue'><b>bridesmaid</b></font>) can. Now I don't mean to get married, and I won't put
myself among the young people.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophy</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora was therefore obliged
to submit to do the work with only six. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) swore that they
should be very smart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was to give all the dresses, and Mr.
Palliser was to give a brooch and an armlet to each. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>bridesmaid</b></font>) is the only
person in the world I want to pet, except yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora
had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had answered by giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) _carte
blanche_ as regards expense.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: Alice and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) bridesmaids.-RSB-


<p/>All this was very terrible to Kate, who had not much feminine taste
for finery. Of the dress she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had heard,--of the dress which was
waiting at Matching to be made up after her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) arrival,--though as yet
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) knew nothing of the trinkets. There are many girls who could
submit themselves at a moment to the kindness of such a woman as Lady
Glencora. Perhaps most girls would do so, for of all such women in
the world, Lady Glencora was the least inclined to patronize or to
be condescending in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) kindnesses. But Kate Vavasor was one to whom
such submission would not come easily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I was out of this boat,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) said to Alice in the train.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So that I might be shipwrecked alone!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; there can be no shipwreck to you. When the day of action comes
you will be taken away, up to heaven, upon the clouds. But what are
they to do with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll find that Glencora will not desert you. You can't conceive
what taste she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) has.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd sooner be bridesmaid to Charlie Fairstairs. I would indeed.
My place in the world is not among Cabinet Ministers and old
countesses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; it seems that yours is to be there. They are your cousins, and
you have made at any rate one great friend among them,--one who is to
be the biggest of them all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are going to throw me over, Kate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To tell the truth, Alice, I sometimes think you had better throw me
over. I know it would be sad,--sad for both, but perhaps it would be
better. I have done you much harm and no good; and now where I am
going I shall disgrace you.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) talked even of getting out at some
station and returning, and would have done so had not Alice made
it impossible. As it was, the evening found her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) and Alice together
entering the park-gate at Matching, in Lady Glencora's carriage.
Lady Glencora had sent a note to the station. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not come
herself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``because Mr. Palliser was a little fussy. You'll
understand, dear, but don't say a word.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Alice didn't say a word,
having been very anxious not to lower Mr. Palliser in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cousin's
respect.

<p/>None of the Lady Janes and Lady Marys were at Matching when they
arrived. Indeed, there was no guest there but Mr. Grey, for which Kate
felt herself to be extremely grateful. Mr. Grey came into the hall,
standing behind Mr. Palliser, who stood behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife. Alice passed
by them both, and was at once in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) lover's arms. <div class="bookquote">``Then I must
introduce myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora to Kate, <div class="bookquote">``and my husband also.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>This she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) did, and no woman in England could have excelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) in
the manner of doing it. <div class="bookquote">``I have heard so much about you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>),
still keeping Kate's hand, <div class="bookquote">``and I know how good you've been;--and
how wicked you have been,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Vavasor/KATE VAVASOR</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) added in a whisper. Then Mr. Grey was
brought up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), and they were introduced. It was not till some
days had passed over them that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) felt herself at all at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) ease
with Mr. Grey, and I doubt whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) ever reached that point with Mr.
Palliser; but Lady Glencora she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) knew, and liked, and almost loved,
from the first moment of their meeting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you heard the news?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora to Alice, the first
minute that they were alone. Alice, of course, had not heard the
news. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bott is going to marry Mrs. Marsham. There is such a row
about it. Plantagenet is nearly mad. I never knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) so disgusted in
my life. Of course I don't dare to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) so, but I am so heartily
rejoiced. You know how I love them both, and I could not possibly
wish any better reward for either.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice, who had personally known
more of Mr. Bott than of Mrs. Marsham, said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) couldn't but be
sorry for the lady. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marsham</b></font>)'s old enough to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>) mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady
Glencora, <div class="bookquote">``otherwise I really don't know any people better suited
to each other. The best is, that Mr. Bott is doing it to regain his (<font color='blue'><b>Bott</b></font>)
footing with Mr. Palliser! I am sure of that;--and Plantagenet will
never speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) again. But, Alice, there is other news.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What other news?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is hardly news yet, and of course I am very wicked to tell you.
But I feel sure Mr. Grey knows all about it, and if I didn't tell, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) hasn't told me anything yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) hasn't had time; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) does, you mustn't pretend to know.
I believe Mr. Palliser will certainly be Chancellor of the Exchequer
before next month, and, if so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)'ll never come in for Silverbridge
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)'ll be in Parliament; will he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)'ll be in Parliament. I don't understand all about it.
There is a man going out for the county,--for Barsetshire,--some man
whom the Duke used to favour, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants Plantagenet to come in for
that. I can't understand what difference it makes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be in the Cabinet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes. But who do you suppose is to be the new Member for
Silverbridge?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't guess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice. Though, of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did guess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mind, I don't know it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) has never told me. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) told me that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Member</b></font>) had been with the Duke, and asked the Duke to let Jeffrey have
the seat. The Duke became as black as thunder, and said that Jeffrey
had no fortune. In short, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) wouldn't hear of it. Poor Jeffrey!
we must try to do something for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>), but I really don't know how.
Then the Duke said, that Plantagenet should put in for Silverbridge
some friend who would support himself; and I fancy,--mind it's only
fancy,--but I fancy that Plantagenet mentioned to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) Grace--one Mr.
Grey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Glencora!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They've been talking together till sometimes I think Mr. Grey is
worse than Plantagenet. When Mr. Grey began to say something the other
night in the drawing-room about sugar, I knew it was all up with you.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)'ll be a financial Secretary; you see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) isn't; or a lord of
something, or an under-somebody of State; and then some day he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)'ll
go mad, either because he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) does or because he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) doesn't get into the
Cabinet.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said all this, knew well that the
news she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) was giving would please her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) cousin better than any other
tidings that could be told.

<p/>By degrees the guests came. The two Miss Howards were the first, and
they expressed themselves as delighted with Lady Glencora's taste
and with Mr. Palliser's munificence,--for at that time the brooches
and armlets had been produced. Kate had said very little about
these matters, but the Miss Howards were loud in their thanks. But
they were good-humoured, merry girls, and the house was pleasanter
after their arrival than it had been before. Then came the dreaded
personage,--the guest,--Lady Midlothian! On the subject of Lady
Midlothian Kate had really become curious. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had a real desire
to see the face and gait of the woman, and to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) voice. Lady
Midlothian came, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) came Lady Jane and Lady Mary. I am by
no means sure that Lady Jane and Lady Mary were not nearly as old as
the two Miss Pallisers; but they were not probably so fully resolved
as to the condition of their future modes of living as were those two
ladies, and if so, they were not wrong to shine as bridesmaids. With
them Alice had made some slight acquaintance during the last spring
in London, and as they were now to attend upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) as the bride they
were sufficiently gracious. To Kate, too, they were civil enough, and
things, in public, went on very pleasantly at Matching.

<p/>A scene there was, of course, between Alice and Lady Midlothian;--a
scene in private. <div class="bookquote">``You must go through it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady Glencora had said,
with jocose mournfulness; <div class="bookquote">``and why should you not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) jump upon
you a little? It can't hurt you now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't like people to jump upon me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why are you to have everything just as you like it? You are so
unreasonable. Think how I've been jumped on! Think what I have borne
from them! If you knew the things she (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) used to say to me, you would
not be such a coward. I was sent down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) for a week, and had no
power of helping myself. And the Marchioness used to be sent for to
look at me, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) never talks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) used to look at me, and groan,
and hold up her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) hands till I hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) the worst of the two. Think
what they did to me, and yet they are my dear friends now. Why should
you escape altogether?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice could not escape altogether, and therefore was closeted with
Lady Midlothian for the best part of an hour. <div class="bookquote">``Did Lady Macleod read
to you what I wrote?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div>the Countess asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,--that is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Macleod</b></font>) gave me the letter to read.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I hope you understand me, Alice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, I suppose so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You suppose so, my dear! If you only suppose so I shall not
be contented. I want you to appreciate my feelings towards you
thoroughly. I want you to know that I am most anxious as to your
future life, and that I am thoroughly satisfied with the step you are
now taking.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Countess</b></font>)</div>The Countess paused, but Alice said nothing. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tongue
was itching to tell the old woman that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cared nothing for this
expression of satisfaction; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had done much
that was deserving of punishment, and resolved to take this as part
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) penance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was being jumped upon, and it was unpleasant;
but, after all that had happened, it was only fitting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should
undergo much unpleasantness. <div class="bookquote">``Thoroughly satisfied,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div>continued the
Countess; <div class="bookquote">``and now, I only wish to refer, in the slightest manner
possible, to what took place between us when we were both of us under
this roof last winter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why refer to it at all, Lady Midlothian?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I think it may do good, and because I cannot make you
understand that I have thoroughly forgiven everything, unless I tell
you that I have forgiven that also. On that occasion I had come all
the way from Scotland on purpose to say a few words to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so sorry that you should have had the trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not regret it, Alice. I never do regret doing anything which
I believe to have been my duty. There is no knowing how far what I
said then may have operated for good.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew
very well, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said nothing. <div class="bookquote">``I must confess that what I then
understood to be your obstinacy,--and I must say also, if I tell the
truth, your indifference to--to--to all prudential considerations
whatever, not to talk of appearances and decorum, and I might say,
anything like a high line of duty or moral conduct,--shocked me
very much. It did, indeed, my dear. Taking it altogether, I don't
know that I was ever more shocked in my life. The thing was so
inscrutable!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>Here Lady Midlothian held up one hand in a manner that
was truly imposing; <div class="bookquote">``so inscrutable! But that is all over now. What
was personally offensive to myself I could easily forgive, and I do
forgive it. I shall never think of it any more.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>Here Lady Midlothian
put up both her (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) hands gently, as though wafting the injury away into
the air. <div class="bookquote">``But what I wish specially to say to you is this; your own
conduct is forgiven also!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Midlothian</b></font>) paused again, and Alice winced.
Who was this dreadful old Countess;--what was the Countess to her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>),
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) should be thus tormented with the old woman's forgiveness?
John Grey had forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>), and of external forgiveness that was
enough. She (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) had not forgiven herself,--would never forgive herself
altogether; and the pardon of no old woman in England could assist
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in doing so. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had sinned, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not sinned against Lady
Midlothian. <div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) jump upon you, and have done with it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>Lady
Glencora had said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) had resolved that it should be so, but it was
very hard to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) resolution.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Marchioness and I have talked it over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>continued Lady
Midlothian, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has asked me to speak for both her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>There is comfort at any rate in that, thought Alice, who had never
yet seen the Marchioness. <div class="bookquote">``We have resolved that all those little
mistakes should be as though they had never been committed. We shall
both be most happy to receive you and your husband, who is, I must
say, one of the most gentlemanlike looking men I ever saw. It seems
that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and Mr. Palliser are on most friendly,--I may say, most
confidential terms, and that must be quite a pleasure to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a pleasure to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), which is more to the purpose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly so. And now, my dear, everything is forgiven and shall be
forgotten. Come and give me a kiss, and let me wish you joy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>Alice
did as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was bidden, and accepted the kiss and the congratulations,
and a little box of jewellery which Lady Midlothian produced from out
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``The diamonds are from the Marchioness, my dear, whose
means, as you doubtless are aware, greatly exceed my own. The garnets
are from me. I hope they may both be worn long and happily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I hardly know which was the worst, the lecture, the kiss, or the
present. The latter she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) would have declined, had it been possible;
but it was not possible. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had agreed to be married at
Matching she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had not calculated the amount of punishment which would
thereby be inflicted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). But I think that, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) bore it
impatiently, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had deserved it. Although she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
fretted herself greatly under the infliction of Lady Midlothian, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
acknowledged to herself, even at the time, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) deserved all
the lashes she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) received. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had made a fool of herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) vain
attempt to be greater and grander than other girls, and it was only
fair that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) folly should be in some sort punished before it was
fully pardoned. John Grey punished it after one fashion; by declining
to allude to it, or to think of it, or to take any account of it. And
now Lady Midlothian had punished it after another fashion, and Alice
went out of the Countess's presence with sundry inward exclamations
of <div class="bookquote">``mea culpa,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div>and with many unseen beatings of the breast.

<p/>Two days before the ceremony came the Marchioness and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) august
daughter. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) Lady Jane was much more august than the other Lady
Jane;--very much more august indeed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had very long flaxen hair,
and very light blue eyes, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did not move frequently, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
spoke very little,--one may almost say not at all, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) never
seemed to do anything. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was very august, and was, as all the
world knew, engaged to marry the Duke of Dumfriesshire, who, though
twice her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own age, was as yet childless, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) should have
completed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mourning for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) first wife. Kate told her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cousin that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) did not at all know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) should ever stand up as one in a
group with so august a person as this Lady Jane, and Alice herself
felt that such an attendant would quite obliterate her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). But Lady Jane
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mother were both harmless. The Marchioness never spoke to
Kate and hardly spoke to Alice, and the Marchioness's Lady Jane was
quite as silent as her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mother.

<p/>On the morning of this day,--the day on which these very august
people came,--a telegram arrived at the Priory calling for Mr.
Palliser's immediate presence in London. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) came to Alice full of
regret, and behaved himself very nicely. Alice now regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) quite
as a friend. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and I know that the
business which takes you up to London pleases you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well; yes;--it
does please me. I am glad,--I don't mind saying so to you. But it
does not please me to think that I shall be away at your marriage.
Pray make your father understand that it was absolutely unavoidable.
But I shall see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), of course, when I come back. And I shall see you
too before very long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because Mr. Grey must be at Silverbridge for his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) election.--But
perhaps I ought not tell you his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) secrets.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) into the
breakfast-parlour and showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) present. It was a service of
Sèvres china,--very precious and beautiful. <div class="bookquote">``I got you these things
because Grey likes china.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I like china,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face brighter than he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) had
ever yet seen it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you would like them best,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>). Alice looking up at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes full of tears told him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did like them best;
and then, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) all happiness, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was stooping over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), Lady Glencora came in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I was just one minute too soon; was I
not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would have them sent here and unpacked,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser,
<div class="bookquote">``though I told her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) it was foolish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``Everything shall be
unpacked and shown. It's easy to get somebody to pack them again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Much of the wedding tribute had already been deposited with the
china, and among other things there were the jewels that Lady
Midlothian had brought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) ladyship's diamonds are not to be sneezed at,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care for diamonds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/>Then Lady Glencora took up the Countess's trinkets, and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
head and turned up her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) nose. There was a wonderfully comic expression
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) did so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To me they are just as good as the others,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To me they are not, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. <div class="bookquote">``Diamonds are
diamonds, and garnets are garnets; and I am not so romantic but what
I know the difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div><p/>On the evening before the marriage Alice and Lady Glencora walked for
the last time through the Priory ruins. It was now September, and the
evenings were still long, so that the ladies could get out upon the
lawn after dinner. Whether Lady Glencora would have been allowed to
walk through the ruins so late as half-past eight in the evening if
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband had been there may be doubtful, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) husband was away
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) took this advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) absence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember that night we were here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When shall I forget it; or how is it possible that such a night
should ever be forgotten?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I shall never forget it. Oh dear, what wonderful things have
happened since that! Do you ever think of Jeffrey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--of course I think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>). I did like him (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) so much. I hope I
shall see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) some day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) liked you too, young woman; and, what was more, young woman,
I thought at one time that, perhaps, you were going to like him (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffrey</b></font>) in
earnest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in that way, certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've done much better, of course; especially as poor Jeffrey's
chance of promotion doesn't look so good now. If I have a boy, I
wonder whether he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll hate me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hate you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help it, you know, if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) does. Only think what it is to
Plantagenet. Have you seen the difference it makes in him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) already?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it makes a difference;--the greatest difference in the
world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And think what it will be to me, Alice. I used to lie in bed and
wish myself dead, and make up my mind to drown myself,--if I could
only dare. I shan't think any more of that poor fellow now.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>)
told Alice what had been done for Burgo; how his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) uncle had paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>)
bills once again, and had agreed to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgo</b></font>) a small income. <div class="bookquote">``Poor
fellow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora, <div class="bookquote">``it won't do more than buy him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) gloves,
you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div><p/>The marriage was magnificent, greatly to the dismay of Alice and
to the discomfort of Mr. Vavasor, who came down on the eve of the
ceremony,--arriving while his (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) daughter and Lady Glencora were in
the ruins. Mr. Grey seemed to take it all very easily, and, as Lady
Glencora said, played his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) part exactly as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) were in the habit
of being married, at any rate, once a year. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing on earth will
ever put him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) out, so you need not try, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) said, as Alice
stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) a moment alone in the dressing-room up-stairs before

<p/>CHAPTER LXXX.

<p/>The Story Is Finished Within the Halls of the Duke of Omnium.


<p/>Mr. Grey and wife were duly carried away from Matching Priory by post
horses, and did their honeymoon, we may be quite sure, with much
satisfaction. When Alice was first asked where she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would go, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
simply suggested that it should not be to Switzerland. They did, in
truth, go by slow stages to Italy, to Venice, Florence, and on to
Rome; but such had not been their intention when they first started
on their journey. At that time Mr. Grey believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) would be
wanted again in England, down at Silverbridge in Barsetshire, very
shortly. But before he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had married a week he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) learned that all that
was to be postponed. The cup of fruition had not yet reached Mr.
Palliser's lips. <div class="bookquote">``There will be no vacancy either in the county or in
the borough till Parliament meets.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>That had been the message sent
by Mr. Palliser to Mr. Grey. Lady Glencora's message to Alice had been
rather more full, having occupied three pages of note paper, the
last of which had been crossed, but I do not know that it was more
explicit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had abused Lord Brock, had abused Mr. Finespun, and had
abused all public things and institutions, because the arrangements
as now proposed would be very comfortable to Alice, but would not,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was pleased to think, be very comfortable to herself. <div class="bookquote">``You
can go to Rome and see everything and enjoy yourself, which I was
not allowed to do; and all this noise and bother, and crowd of
electioneering, will take place down in Barsetshire just when I am in
the middle of all my trouble.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>There were many very long letters came
from Lady Glencora to Rome during the winter,--letters which Alice
enjoyed thoroughly, but which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not but regard as being very
indiscreet. The Duke was at the Castle during the Christmas week, and
the descriptions of the Duke and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) solicitude as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Finespun</b></font>) heir
were very comic. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) comes and bends over me on the sofa in the most
stupendous way, as though a woman to be the mother of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) heir must
be a miracle in nature. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is quite awful when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) says a word or two,
and more awful in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) silence. The devil prompted me the other day,
and I said I hoped it would be a girl. There was a look came over his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)
face which nearly frightened me. If it should be, I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) will
turn me out of the house; but how can I help it? I wish you were
going to have a baby at the same time. Then, if yours was a boy and
mine a girl, we'd make a change.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This was very indiscreet. Lady
Glencora would write indiscreet letters like this, which Alice could
not show to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) husband. It was a thousand pities.

<p/>But December and January wore themselves away, and the time came in
which the Greys were bound to return to England. The husband had
very fully discussed with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife that matter of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) parliamentary
ambition, and found in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a very ready listener. Having made up
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mind to do this thing, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was resolved to do it thoroughly, and
was becoming almost as full of politics, almost as much devoted to
sugar, as Mr. Palliser himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) at any rate could not complain that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) wife would not interest herself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) pursuits. Then, as they
returned, came letters from Lady Glencora, written as her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) troubles
grew nigh. The Duke had gone, of course; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was to be there at
the appointed time. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I do so wish he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would have a fit of the gout
in London,--or at Timbuctoo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Glencora. When they reached
London they first heard the news from Mr. Vavasor, who on this
occasion condescended to meet them at the railway. <div class="bookquote">``The Duke has got
an heir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vavasor</b></font>) said, before the carriage-door was open;--<div class="bookquote">``born this
morning!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>One might have supposed that it was the Duke's baby, and
not the baby of Lady Glencora and Mr. Palliser. There was a note from
Mr. Palliser to Mr. Grey. <div class="bookquote">``Thank God!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the note, <div class="bookquote">``Lady Glencora
and the boy'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>--Mr. Palliser had scorned to use the word child--<div class="bookquote">``Lady
Glencora and the boy are quite as well as can be expected. Both the
new writs were moved for last night.''  (<font color='red'><b>the word child</b></font>)</div>Mr. Palliser's honours, as will
be seen, came rushing upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) all at once.

<p/>Wondrous little baby,--_purpureo genitus!_ What have the gods not
done for thee, if thou canst only manage to live till thy good things
are all thine own,--to live through all the terrible solicitude with
which they will envelope thee! Better than royal rank will be thine,
with influence more than royal, and power of action fettered by no
royalty. Royal wealth which will be really thine own, to do with it
as it beseemeth thee. Thou wilt be at the top of an aristocracy in a
country where aristocrats need gird themselves with no buckram. All
that the world can give will be thine; and yet when we talk of thee
religiously, philosophically, or politico-economically, we are wont
to declare that thy chances of happiness are no better,--no better,
if they be no worse,--than are those of thine infant neighbour just
born, in that farmyard cradle. Who shall say that they are better or
that they are worse? Or if they be better, or if they be worse, how
shall we reconcile to ourselves that seeming injustice?

<p/>And now we will pay a little visit to the small one born in the
purple, and the story of that visit shall be the end of our history.
It was early in April, quite early in April, and Mr. and Mrs. Grey were
both at Gatherum Castle. Mrs. Grey was there at the moment of which
we write, but Mr. Grey was absent at Silverbridge with Mr. Palliser.
This was the day of the Silverbridge election, and Mr. Grey had gone
to that ancient borough, to offer himself as a candidate to the
electors, backed by the presence and aid of a very powerful member of
the Cabinet. Lady Glencora and Alice were sitting up-stairs with the
small, purple-born one in their presence, and the small, purple-born
one was lying in Alice's lap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is such a comfort that it is over,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are the most ungrateful of women.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Alice,--if you could have known! Your baby may come just as it
pleases. You won't lie awake trembling how on earth you will bear
your disgrace if one of the vile weaker sex should come to disturb
the hopes of your lords and masters;--for I had two, which made it so
much more terrible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure Mr. Palliser would not have said a word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) would have said nothing,--nor would the Duke. The Duke would
simply have gone away instantly, and never have seen me again till
the next chance comes,--if it ever does come. And Mr. Palliser would
have been as gentle as a dove;--much more gentle than he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) is now, for
men are rarely gentle in their triumph. But I should have known what
they both thought and felt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all right now, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my bonny boy,--you have made it all right for me;--have you
not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>And Lady Glencora took her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) baby into her (<font color='blue'><b>Glencora</b></font>) own arms. <div class="bookquote">``You have
made everything right, my little man. But oh, Alice, if you had seen
the Duke's long face through those three days; if you had heard the
tones of the people's voices as they whispered about me; if you
had encountered the oppressive cheerfulness of those two London
doctors,--doctors are such bad actors,--you would have thought it
impossible for any woman to live throughout. There's one comfort;--if
my mannikin lives, I can't have another eldest. He (<font color='blue'><b>eldest</b></font>) looks like
living;--don't he (<font color='blue'><b>eldest</b></font>), Alice?''  (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div>Then were perpetrated various mysterious
ceremonies of feminine idolatry which were continued till there came
a grandly dressed old lady, who called herself the nurse, and who
took the idol away.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, my bonny boy,--you have made it
all right for me.'' (<font color='red'><b>Lady Glencora/Glencora/Lady Glencora M `` Cluskie</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/>In the course of that afternoon Lady Glencora took Alice all over
the house. It was a castle of enormous size, quite new,--having been
built by the present proprietor,--very cold, very handsome, and very
dull. <div class="bookquote">``What an immense place!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Vavasor/Alice Vavasor</b></font>)</div>said Alice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) stood looking round
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in the grand hall, which was never used as an entrance except on
very grand occasions. <div class="bookquote">``Is it not? And it cost--oh, I can't tell you
how much it cost. A hundred thousand pounds or more. Well;--that
would be nothing, as the Duke no doubt had the money in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pocket
to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) liked with at the time. But the joke is, nobody ever
thinks of living here. Who'd live in such a great, overgrown place
such as this, if they could get a comfortable house like Matching? Do
you remember Longroyston and the hot-water pipes? I always think of
the poor Duchess when I come through here. Nobody ever lives here, or
ever will. The Duke comes for one week in the year, and Plantagenet
says he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hates to do that. As for me, nothing on earth shall ever make
me live here. I was completely in their power and couldn't help their
bringing me here the other day;--because I had, as it were, disgraced
myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How disgraced yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In being so long, you know, before that gentleman was born. But they
shan't play me the same trick again. I shall dare to assert myself,
now. Come,--we must go away. There are some of the British public
come to see one of the British sights. That's another pleasure here.
One has to run about to avoid being caught by the visitors. The
housekeeper tells me they always grumble because they are not allowed
to go into my little room up-stairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/>On the evening of that day Mr. Palliser and Mr. Grey returned home from
Silverbridge together. The latter was then a Member of Parliament,
but the former at that moment was the possessor of no such dignity.
The election for the borough was now over, whereas that for the
county had not yet taken place. But there was no rival candidate for
the position, and Mr. Palliser was thoroughly contented with his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) fate.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was at this moment actually Chancellor of the Exchequer, and in
about ten days' time would be on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) legs in the House proposing for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) country's use his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) scheme of finance. The two men were seated
together in an open carriage, and were being whirled along by four
horses. They were both no doubt happy in their ambition, but I think
that of the two, Mr. Palliser showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) triumph the most. Not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>)
spoke even to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) friend a word that was triumphant in its tone. It
was not thus that he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) rejoiced. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) was by nature too placid for that.
But there was a nervousness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) contentment which told the tale to
any observer who might know how to read it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you'll like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) said to Grey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never like it as you do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>Grey answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why not;--why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the first place, I have not begun it so young.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Any time before thirty-five is young enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For useful work, yes,--but hardly for enjoyment in the thing. And
then I don't believe it all as you do. To you the British House of
Commons is everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palliser with unwonted
enthusiasm;--<div class="bookquote">``everything, everything. That and the Constitution are
everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palliser/Jeffrey/Jeffrey Palliser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not so to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but it will be. If you really take to the work, and put yourself
into harness, it will be so. You'll get to feel it as I do. The man
who is counted by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) colleagues as number one on the Treasury Bench
in the English House of Commons, is the first of living men. That's
my opinion. I don't know that I ever said it before; but that's my
opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And who is the second;--the purse-bearer to this great man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say nothing about the second. I don't know that there is any
second. I wonder how we shall find Lady Glencora and the boy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grey/John Grey/Grey</b></font>)</div>They
had then arrived at the side entrance to the Castle, and Mr. Grey ran
up-stairs to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) wife's room to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) congratulations.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are a Member of Parliament?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They tell me so, but I don't know whether I actually am one till
I've taken the oaths.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so happy. There's no position in the world so glorious!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a pity you are not Mr. Palliser's wife. That's just what he (<font color='blue'><b>Palliser</b></font>) has
been saying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, John, I am so happy. It is so much more than I have deserved. I
hope,--that is, I sometimes think--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Think what, dearest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope nothing that I have ever said has driven you to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd do more than that, dear, to make you happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) put
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``more than that, at least if it
were in my power.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Probably my readers may agree with Alice, that in the final
adjustment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) affairs she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had received more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
deserved. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) friends, except her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) husband, thought so. But as
they have all forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), including even Lady Midlothian herself, I
hope that they who have followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) story to its close will not be
less generous.

<p/>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

<p/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<p/>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
-LRB-$1 to $5,000-RRB- are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

<p/>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

<p/>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

<p/>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<p/>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<p/>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

<p/>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hart</b></font>) produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

<p/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<p/>http://www.gutenberg.org

<p/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
